<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>This is pretty well optimized. All I can say is that some variables could have better names</p>

<pre><code>pptPres - targetPresentation
sld - targetSlide
shpe - targetShape
c - targetChartObject
sht - targetSheet
fndList - wordsToFind
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise, like I said, there's nothing I can really say need to be optimized.</p>

<p>If you don't have to change the window viewtype and activate the chart data, I'd get rid of those.</p>

<p>There are a few observations we can make about the nature of the problem.</p>

<p>The first and most obvious observation is that the building heights will keep decreasing until the first building hits 0. As soon as that happens, the building heights will follow the form <span class="math-container">\$h, 0, h, h, 0, \ldots \$</span>, repeating the last non-zero height twice before adding in a zero again.<br>
Note that the same is true for equal building heights (though that much should've been obvious).</p>

<p>The next observation is the following: When the first building is smaller than the second, the output of <code>cumulative_heights(a, b, n)</code> is <code>a + cumulative_heights(b, b - a, n - 1)</code></p>

<p>Now that we handled "special cases", we should take a look at the properties of the "general case". In the following, <span class="math-container">\$a &gt; b\$</span></p>

<p>Now let's examine the behaviour of four simple sequences:</p>

<p><span class="math-container">$$
\begin{align}
(1) &amp; 20, 5, 15, 10, 5, 5, 0, \ldots \\
(2) &amp; 20, 9, 11, 2, 9, 7, 2, 5, 3, 2, 1, 1, 0, \ldots\\
(3) &amp; 20, 4, 16, 12, 4, 8, 4, 4, 0, \ldots\\
(4) &amp; 20, 6, 14, 8, 6, 2, 4, 2, 2, 0, \ldots
\end{align}
$$</span></p>

<p>Note how in all of these sequences the smaller building height keeps repeating.</p>

<p>I've chosen these for certain additional properties they exhibit. It's important to understand how the divisibility of the building heights comes into play here. Using <span class="math-container">\$(\lfloor \frac{a}{b} \rfloor, a \mod b)\$</span> to classify these sequences gives us an insight:</p>

<p>The sequences where <span class="math-container">\$a \mod b = 0\$</span> very quickly result in a repeating pattern. Because the repeated subtraction returns 0 at some point, these sequences (namely (1) and (3)) "end" the descent of the building heights.</p>

<p>The other two sequences are somewhat more interesting.<br>
When we look at them somewhat differently we get the following picture:</p>

<p><span class="math-container">$$
20, 9, 11, 2, 9\\
2, 9 \\
9, 7, 2, 5, 3, 2, 1\\
2, 1, 1, 0 \\
... \\
20, 6, 14, 8, 6, 2\\
6, 2, 4, 2, 2, 0
$$</span></p>

<p>Now when you see this I <em>hope</em> you notice that there's multiple subsequences  here. I repeated the "start" of each subsequence to make it easier to notice.</p>

<p>The deciding factor about what exactly happens when the first subsequence ends is whether <span class="math-container">\$\lfloor \frac{a}{b} \rfloor \$</span> is even or not. If it is, that's equivalent to the first case (sequence (2)). If it isn't we get the somewhat cleaner and easier to reason about result of sequence (4).</p>

<p>Note how upon reaching <span class="math-container">\$a \mod b\$</span> the even case "adds another <span class="math-container">\$b\$</span>", which will always be larger than <span class="math-container">\$a \mod b\$</span>. The sequence then continues with <span class="math-container">\$(b, b - (a \mod b))\$</span>. </p>

<p>The odd case however just "starts sooner" and follows a sequence based on <span class="math-container">\$(b, a \mod b)\$</span>.</p>

<p>The only remaining puzzle piece to turn this into a working analytical (and possibly recursive) solution is to understand how many steps elapse before the "next subsequence" begins and to encapsulate this behaviour into a separate function that takes the two starting heights and the number of buildings as arguments.</p>

<p>I leave the hammering out of that detail to you :)</p>

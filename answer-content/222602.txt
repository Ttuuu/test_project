<p>Minor, but I'd expand your <code>foreach</code> a bit to make it clearer that <code>func</code> is a side-effect function that happens to return an indicator. In its current form, it looks like the function is only being run for the purpose of the condition.</p>

<p>Something closer to:</p>

<pre><code>def foreach(self, func):
    for key, value in self.json.items():
        should_continue = func(key, value)

        if should_continue == False:
            break
</code></pre>

<p>If you flipped the logic and had them return when they want to break instead though, you could make it read a little nicer:</p>

<pre><code>def foreach(self, func):
    for key, value in self.json.items():
        should_break = func(key, value)

        if should_break:
            break
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>I'm not sure there's much benefit to using your <code>print</code> method. I believe it's convoluting the simple task of just passing the object to <code>print</code>. If the user wants to pass some function before printing, just let them do it.</p>

<p>As an example, what intuitively makes more sense to you?:</p>

<pre><code>json.print(str)
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>print(str(json))
</code></pre>

<p>Personally, I find the latter to make more sense.</p>

<p>I'll also note, your <code>return</code>s in that function aren't necessary. You don't need an early return since the two paths of execution are exclusive from each other, and an implicit <code>return</code> happens at the end of the method anyway.</p>

<p>Finally, I don't think negating the condition in <code>if not func</code> helps readability. I've read negating conditions makes them generally more difficult to understand, and I agree with that. I avoid negating a condition like that unless I really want a certain order of the bodies for aesthetic purposes. I'd write it as:</p>

<pre><code>def print(self, func = None):
    if func:
        print(func(self))

    else:
        print(self)
</code></pre>

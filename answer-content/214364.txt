<p>Couple of other thoughts on this:</p>

<p>ValidateBid is probably making some checks which it shouldn't be making. The top 3 conditions are all related to the validation of a bid, but the latter two are not. I would be inclined to move the "auction not started yet" check and "User reputation" check elsewhere. It seems like they should come before the bid validation just thinking through it procedurally. </p>

<ul>
<li>If the auction isn't ongoing then nobody can bid.</li>
<li>If the auction is ongoing but the user hasn't got enough reputation they can't bid.</li>
<li>If auction is ongoing, the user is good, but their bid is too low they can't bid.</li>
</ul>

<p>Seems like the natural flow of checks.</p>

<p>The remaining three conditions are all variations on "bid is below minimum" so you could just cut out the very specific error messages and include one which states "bid is below minimum value: $x"</p>

<p>Your validate bid method then looks something like</p>

<pre><code>private void ValidateBid(double bid)
{
    var minimumBid = new int[] {(CurrentHighestBid + 0.01), ReservePrice}.Max();
    if (bid &lt; minimumBid)
        throw new ArgumentException($"Bid is below minimum value ${minimumBid}");
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also note that in the question, you're allowing a user to submit a bid which is the same value as the current highest bid. You're also allowing a user to bid 0 as long as there's no reserve and no bids higher than 0. Might be desired behaviour but I guess probably not.</p>

<p>Last thing - I'd recommend some unit tests for this class. There are a lot of different reasons you may not accept a user's bid and it's gonna be easy for some to slip through the net as you refactor.</p>

  <p>Authorship of code: Since Code Review is a community where programmers improve their skills through peer review, we require that the code be <a href="https://codereview.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3649/my-question-was-closed-as-being-off-topic-what-are-my-options/3654#3654">posted by an author or maintainer</a> of the code, that the code be embedded directly, and that <em>the poster know why the code is written the way it is</em>.</p>

<p>I'll assume you are (now) the maintainer of the code, since you are doing a code review of it, and considering changing it.  If you have inherited this code, you probably have access to the original author of the code, and should ask them <strong>why</strong> they wrote it the way they did.  If they are no longer around, and this is now your code to maintain, and you are considering changing it for clarity ...</p>

<p>I would drop the <code>.is()</code> altogether, and use:</p>

<pre><code>return a==ZERO &amp;&amp; b==NULL   ||   b==ZERO &amp;&amp; a==NULL;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>.is()</code> method is <code>private</code>, and can't be used outside of the class.  The implementation of the <code>.is()</code> method is not doing anything other than a <code>==</code> test, so it is adding visual noise (extra characters), and mental noise (another function to examine to understand the code), and possible inefficiency (extra function calls) for no apparent gain.</p>

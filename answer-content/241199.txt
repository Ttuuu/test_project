<p>This is a review of the initial code that was posted. Unfortunately, I don't have time to revise it now for the new code.</p>

<hr>

<p>Wanting to lessen the number of methods in a class is on its own a poor reason to split up a class into multiple. Classes can have many methods, and we can use IDE functionality and good documentation to make sense of a class.</p>

<p>Having many methods <em>can</em> suggest though that the class is doing too much, and <em>that</em> would be a more logical justification to split the class up. A better thing to think about is not the size of the class, but what the job of the class is, and if it's doing too many things.</p>

<p>That said, if you feel like it's justified to split it, I wouldn't do it as you have here. You've given the entire state of the <code>Greeter</code> object to <code>Spanish</code>. If <code>Spanish</code> begins using a lot of the state in <code>Greeter</code>, you now have two tightly coupled classes that will begin to break as you make changes to either.</p>

<p>Just give <code>Spanish</code> the information that it explicitly needs:</p>

<pre><code>class Spanish:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def hola(self):
        return f"Hola, {self.name}"

    def buen_dia(self):
        return f"Buenos d√≠as, {self.name}"
</code></pre>

<p>And</p>

<pre><code>class Greeter:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.spanish = Spanish(name)  # And just pass the name
    . . .
</code></pre>

<p>This setup really doesn't make sense though. To get a greeting in Spanish, you need to access an object that greets in English? Even combined it doesn't make much sense. Having an object that greets in multiple languages seems odd. It would make more sense to have completely discrete classes that don't know about each other.</p>

<p>With a toy example like this though, it's really hard to make a concrete suggestion because the actual intent isn't clear. The textbox that I'm writing the answer in is also bugging out, so I'm going to submit this before I lose everything.</p>

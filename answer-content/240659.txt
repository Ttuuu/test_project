<p>You can use list comprehension as well as the built-in <code>all()</code> and <code>any()</code> methods to make your <code>is_winner()</code> method more concise and readable:</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>def is_winner(self, player):
    """Returns True if the player won and False otherwise."""
    row1 = [self.board[val] for val in ["TL","TM","TR"]]
    row2 = [self.board[val] for val in ["ML","MM","MR"]]
    row3 = [self.board[val] for val in ["BL","BM","BR"]]
    col1 = [self.board[val] for val in ["TL","ML","BL"]]
    col2 = [self.board[val] for val in ["TM","MM","BM"]]
    col3 = [self.board[val] for val in ["TR","MR","BR"]]
    dia1 = [self.board[val] for val in ["TL","MM","BR"]]
    dia2 = [self.board[val] for val in ["TR","MM","BL"]]
    wins = [row1, row2, row3, col1, col2, col3, dia1, dia2]

    isPlayer = lambda cell: cell == player.type
    isWinner = lambda seq: all(map(isPlayer, seq))
    if any(map(isWinner, wins)):
        ''' Returns true if any possible win is a win '''
        return True
    else:
        return False
</code></pre>

<p>The code to get all of the possible win combinations could have been made more concise if the board was represented by a 2D array rather than a <code>dict</code> as you have it; but the explicit nature of assigning the values of each row still has its benefits.</p>

<hr>

<p>Messed around and made a more DRY way of building the <code>wins</code> array, but the nested list comprehension is arguably less readable/understandable. Nonetheless, here it is just for fun:</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>wins = [[self.board[cell] for cell in seq] 
        for seq in [ 
            ["TL","TM","TR"], # Row 1
            ["ML","MM","MR"], # Row 2
            ["BL","BM","BR"], # Row 3
            ["TL","ML","BL"], # Col 1
            ["TM","MM","BM"], # Col 2
            ["TR","MR","BR"], # Col 3
            ["TL","MM","BR"], # Dia 1
            ["TR","MM","BL"]  # Dia 2
        ]   
]

<p>The most obvious target for improvement is the outer loop:</p>

<p>Currently, you loop over all characters. If there are few characters, that's fine. If there are many, it's unconscionable.</p>

<p>Consider dividing your play-area into a grid, and adding a <code>std::unordered_multimap</code> to find all characters in a cell. Depending on the range and your cell-size, you won't have to search too many cells, and they won't have that many characters each.</p>

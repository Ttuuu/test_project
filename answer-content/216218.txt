<p>Separation of concerns and single responsibility are the keys here.</p>

<p>Your <code>for</code> loop does two things, but because you know what they are and how they are done it seems (now) easier to read. </p>

<p>When you or (more importantly) someone else will come to the same code later, you will be asking yourself first: "What is going on here?" and only after that: "How is it done?". </p>

<p>And then the <code>array_filter</code>, <code>array_map</code> implementations will be much easier to comprehend. Each chunk of code does exactly one thing. So if you want to know how people are filtered, you look inside the <code>array_filter</code> and if you want to know how the extracting is done - look inside <code>array_map</code>.</p>

<p>You can extract those chunks to separate well-named methods and your code will look even better (Read Clean Code by Uncle Bob). And if your filtering or extracting strategies change you can modify them separately without worrying about breaking the other.</p>

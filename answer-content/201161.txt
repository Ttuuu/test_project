<h1>Don't guess!</h1>
<p>You should not attempt to correct client input unless you make sure that the client knows (via a click) that a change has been made.</p>
<p>Converting a value like <code>100,1.0</code> to <code>1001.0</code> is a guess. The client may have intended only the <code>100</code>, or the <code>1.0</code> and your guess may not be noticed.</p>
<p>You can vet input as it is entered or on paste, removing non numeric characters (which you don't do) eg <code>"a100a"</code> will become <code>100</code>, but when there is ambiguity like <code>"a100a00"</code> it should be considered not a number.</p>
<p>If the result is not a number use standard validation warnings rather than guessing.</p>

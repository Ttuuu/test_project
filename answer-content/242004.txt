<p>One advice I can give is to throw exceptions or return true/false from methods in <code>Account</code> class to that the client (in your case main class) could take the necessary action. The problem I see here is the <code>Account</code> class prints some texts that are displayed to user. Obviously, this is not <code>Account</code> class' job.</p>

<p>Secondly, there are too many lines of code in your main method which makes me think that you should create a class/methods and distribute the work accordingly at first glance.</p>

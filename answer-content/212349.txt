<p>I think good coding practices should prioritize efficiency before code brevity.  It is important to not ask for unnecessary work to be done (this is part of the artistry of being a clever coder).  Implementing an early exit, in my opinion is a non-negotiable factor in selecting the "best" code design.</p>

<p>Using a function like <code>array_walk_recursive()</code> is handy for its leafnode traversal, but I agree that the syntax of making an early exit is a little unsightly.  For this reason, I recommend a language construct as part of the recursive design.  The conditional logic is the only part that can be condensed, so I've tried to boil it down as much as possible.</p>

<p>Code: (<a href="https://3v4l.org/ZTMcu" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Demo</a>)</p>

<pre><code>function anyFish(array $collection)
{
    foreach ($collection as $item)
    {
        if((is_array($item) &amp;&amp; anyFish($item)) || $item instanceof Fish)
        {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I don't think it is horrible to look at, but everybody loves their own babies.  I'm not sure that I can make it any more readable.</p>

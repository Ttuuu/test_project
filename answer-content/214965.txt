<p>I think that <code>200_success</code> already covered most points. I would however like to add an alternative idea for the printing part:</p>

<pre><code>print("Enter the number of your choice -",
    *(f'{i}. {opt}' for i, opt in enumerate(options, 1)),
    sep='\n', end='\n\n')
</code></pre>

<p>Explanation:
from the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" rel="noreferrer">docs</a> we see that following signature for the print function:</p>

<pre><code> print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)
</code></pre>

<p>we can therefore print everything with a single print call instead of three individual ones. I leave it up to you which one you perceive easier to use.</p>

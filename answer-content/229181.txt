<p>Besides small points like the use of <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> to indent, <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> unsemantically, everything looks well organized with a lot of effort in styling.</p>

<p>And that leads me to the main point:</p>

<p><strong>It would be better to separate text content and styling.</strong></p>

<p>And that would mean an XML format with a custom XML-to-HTML XSL transformation.
There are some XML formats like SimpleDocBook that can cover much. You might even combine things by custom XML to docbook XML to HTML. Or PDF.</p>

<p>So my advice: make the text content, and its editing the main concern,
and then add conversion to HTML.</p>

<p>XML may be validated by an XSD or DTD for instance. There might be a usable XML editor that can do autocompletion and such.</p>

<p>I love documentation, but you are risking "editing by copying HTML snippets." That is not good for reuse, starting clean.</p>

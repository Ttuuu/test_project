<p>Let's examine the first five adjecent digits, they are</p>

<pre><code>7 * 3 * 1 * 6 * 7 = 882
</code></pre>

<p>and if you now compare it to the second five adjecent digits:</p>

<pre><code>3 * 1 * 6 * 7 * 1 = 126
</code></pre>

<p>From that we can easily see that we can get the solution for the second equation if we devide the solution of the first equation by the first number(7) and multiply that with the next number (in this case 1).</p>

<p>Same logic can be applied to the 13 digit product.</p>

<p>What I'm saying is... you don't need nested loops.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
sorry... forgot about the "zero problem"</p>

<p>I just thought of something...
why not replace all ocurences of 0 with -1, would that help?
I didn't think this one throuhg, but this is basicaly what I had in mind:
0 is problematic only when we try to devide with it.</p>

<p>Let's see on an example:
let's say we have the input:</p>

<pre><code>0 1 2 3 4 5
</code></pre>

<p>then</p>

<p>0 * 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 0</p>

<p>if we replace the 0 with -1 we get</p>

<pre><code>-1 * 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = -24
</code></pre>

<p>the product of the next five digits is:</p>

<pre><code>1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120
</code></pre>

<p>which is equal (-24 / -1) * 5</p>

<p>as we can see... division with -1 is not problematic</p>

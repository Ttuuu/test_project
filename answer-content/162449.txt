<p>There are a few things that I would do differently and/or change:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I usually find it easier to put all the public methods at the top and the private methods at the bottom instead of mixing them. This is also what I see most people do.</p></li>
<li><p>Be consistent. In <code>pin_error</code> you return an error message, in <code>over_error</code> you <code>print</code> the message (elsewhere you use <code>puts</code>). I would make both methods just <code>puts</code> the error message.</p></li>
<li><p>I would not assign an instance variable in <code>amount</code> just return the value and then change <code>withdraw</code> to use a local variable. I would also call it <code>get_amount</code> or something since it does more than just return an amount.</p>

<pre><code>def withdraw
  amt = get_amount
  if  amt &lt;= @balance
    @balance -= amt
    puts "Withdrew: $#{amt}. Updated balance: $#{@balance}."  
  else
    over_error
  end
end       
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The <code>pin</code> method is odd in that it returns the bin but also sets an instance variable unnecessarily. I would pass the pin into the constructor.</p></li>
<li><p>I would make <code>pin_check</code> actually check if the pin is correct and return true or false. I would also give it an active name, with a bang, like <code>check_pin!</code></p></li>
</ul>

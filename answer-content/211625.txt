<p>Some improvement's I've come up with myself:</p>

<ul>
<li>Change <code>__repr__</code> of child classes to not use the parent, slicing the string seems a bit confusing.</li>
<li>Return <code>pd.DataFrame</code> from child classes with categories as headers for easy use afterwards.</li>
<li>Actually check for the one-dimensionality in <code>transform_from_labels</code> of child classes that was required in docstring but now also enforced by returning a DataFrame.</li>
<li>Change test suite accordingly, namely get <code>.values</code> of the DF for tests and pass 1D data.</li>
</ul>

<p>I may be blind to other mistakes so I still very much welcome other answers!</p>

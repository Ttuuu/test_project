<p>I think your naming scheme is good and on first sight its very easy to see what the code does without having to study it too much.</p>

<p>However, if I would pick on something I would say:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Remove the unnecessary whitespace, ex. if ( condition ), or self.getUserInfo( userId ). This is of course a matter of taste, but I find it more consistent with regular coding style to not 'bloat' with whitespace.</p></li>
<li><p>optparser was deprecated in 2.7: <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/optparse.html">http://docs.python.org/library/optparse.html</a></p></li>
<li><p>in parser.add.option() you could remove the word "show" from the dest name and rather do the following, hence eliminating the need for all the declarations of show_display_name and still keep easy code readability.</p>

<pre><code>...
parser.add.option(parser.add_option("-r", "--reputation", action="store_true", dest="reputation", default=False, help="Show user's reputation")
(show, args) = parser.parse_args()

fetch = StackOverflowFetcher()
if(show.reputation) : print fetch.getUserReputation(show.userId)
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>I don't really see what the point of the following line which sets everything to true, it seems a bit weird since you use store_true as action if the option parsed is set.</p>

<pre><code>if ( (not show_display_name) and (not show_view_count) and (not show_reputation) ):
show_display_name = show_view_count = show_reputation = True
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

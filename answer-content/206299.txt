<p>I find your code very readable.</p>

<ul>
<li>"Division exercises have to be solved without rest"  should instead read "division exercises should be solved without remainders" or something.  "without rest" doesn't mean anything to me.</li>
<li>It is crashing when symbols like / and . are used in an answer, instead remind user of above rule.  In general, handle invalid input instead of having program crash.</li>
<li>Consider a validation using a modulus test for the division exercises to make sure the random numbers generated and divided have a whole number for the answer.  If not, get another random number.</li>
<li>Goal is to persist high score so that it is available next time the program is launched.  Main.java looks like it should persist this high score to a file called .mathematicianSave but it does not unless I chose to exit at the menu with 0.  Most of my exits have been because of crashes.</li>
<li>Menu item [0] Leave only appears when program first launches</li>
<li>in the getRandomExercise() method, I would not hard code the upper limits for number1 and number2 but instead use a variable declared at start of method.</li>
<li>in the calculate() method of Main class, I would also not hard code the 5 but instead make it a variable called numberOfQuestions and declare it at start of method.</li>
</ul>

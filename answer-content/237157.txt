<p>Well, there are few points to address.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Your code is structured in a lot of ways: at the same level, we have variables, a function and a class. You have game logic directly in the module, which is evaluated once (at module import), so your bot always have the same choice made.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, the RPS class is not necessary. It only do stuff on instantiation, and it uses a function outside itself to print each player's choice. I think you should remove it, mainly because you will never need several RPS objects at once, nor have to store informations for a while.</p></li>
<li><p>Regarding to formatting your code, personnaly I always set a character limit per line of 100. I find it helps to keep the code a little bit more readable (personnal choice).</p></li>
</ul>

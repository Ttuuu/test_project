<p>My Linear Algebra is a bit rusty, but I think that your terminology is a bit off:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>public class GramSchmidtProcess&lt;VCT, IPT, FT&gt; {
    …

    /**
     * Performs the Gram-Schmidt process upon {@code basis}.
     * 
     * @param basis the basis to process.
     * @return the orthogonal basis.
     */
    public Vector&lt;VCT&gt;[] process(Vector&lt;VCT&gt;... basis) {
        …

        // Remove the duplicates and return whatever is left:
        return removeDuplicates(orthogonalBasis);
    }
}
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>If the input is in fact a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_%28linear_algebra%29" rel="nofollow noreferrer">basis</a>, then the vectors are, by definition, linearly independent and spanning.  If the inputs are linearly independent, how would it be possible to produce duplicate vectors in the output?</p>

<p>The Wikipedia article says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the Gram–Schmidt process is applied to a linearly dependent sequence, it outputs the <b>0</b> vector on the <i>i</i>th step, assuming that <b>v</b><sub><i>i</i></sub> is a linear combination of <b>v</b><sub>1</sub>, …, <b>v</b><sub><em>i</em>−1</sub>. If an orthonormal basis is to be produced, then the algorithm should test for zero vectors in the output and discard them because no multiple of a zero vector can have a length of 1.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps you are prepared to accept as input a list of vectors that do not necessarily constitute a basis?  In that case, the <code>basis</code> parameter should be renamed to something more general, such as <code>vectors</code>.</p>

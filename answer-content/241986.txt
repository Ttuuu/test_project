<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>It's a correct way to do it like this.
Few suggestions:</p>

<p>Add validation before creating user. You don't want to fail on save for duplicate user email. For better UX if you can it's a good idea to do it even before form submit (with ajax request when email field is changed).</p>

<p>If your app has more user related things like user profile, user control panel I will suggest you to auto login user after form submit. Just before redirect() add <code>Auth::login($user)</code></p>

<p>I am self learning Python and am not so experienced as you are. So I actually have a couple of questions on your code. Mainly, I want to know why have you built such a complex logic for such a simple problem? TBH, I am not even sure if I understand fully what your code is doing. Below I have pasted my code, and it gives the right answer (2091 steps) in 0.0005s, which is small enough I guess. Are you trying to run it in lesser time duration than that, and hence the complicated logic?</p>

<pre><code>def collatz(n):
    steps = 0
    while n != 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            n = n // 2
        else:
            n = (n * 3) + 1
        steps += 1

    print(steps)
</code></pre>

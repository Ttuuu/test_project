<p>Instead of using two <code>int[]</code>s, you could use two <code>HashSet&lt;Integer&gt;</code> instances instead, because duplicates in any of the two arrays can be ignored. Also, the declaration of <code>gcd</code> and <code>sum</code> in <code>maximumGcdAndSum(int[], int[])</code> could be moved into the innermost <code>for</code> loop to reduce their scope to the smallest extent necessary, which would make the code a bit clearer in my opinion. Other than that, your code seems to be succinct and working.</p>

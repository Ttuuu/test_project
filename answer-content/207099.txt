<p>Since you don't actually use the first column or row you should preprocess the files to remove them: <code>sed -i -e '1d;s/[0-9]\+,//' *</code>. You can then use <code>split --lines=1 --suffix-length=7</code> to put each line in its own file. This <em>should</em> be faster than your Python script - these tools are very optimized for fast text processing, even of large files.</p>

<p>You don't need to convert cell values to <code>str</code>. From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html#csv.reader" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>:</p>

  <p>Each row read from the csv file is returned as a list of strings.</p>

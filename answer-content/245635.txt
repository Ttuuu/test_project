<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>Your <code>yesX</code> / <code>noX</code> variables are local only to the if else block you declared them in.</p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>final String foo;
if (yesBTN4.isChecked()) {
  foo = "bar";
} else if(noBTN4.isChecked()) {
  foo = "barz";
}
</code></pre>
<p>Which brings me to another choice you decided to make. How are you going to determine if you're passing <code>yes2</code> or <code>no2</code> into your database. That would require another check. Instead have one variable to store per question response. Noticed how I used one variable for both yes and no and it equals different things based on branch.</p>
<p>Finally, there is no reason to call <code>trim()</code> on the the radiobutton <code>.getText()</code> because the text is typically what YOU specified it to be. So unless you are doing something crazy like <code>RadioButton rb5 = new RadioButton(" Hello, World!    ");</code> there isn't a reason to make that method call.</p>

<p>I don't code in C#, but I can clearly see the solution looks unreadable, and unnecessarily large.
For the given problem there is a pattern. Take initial <code>count = 2</code>, for each character that is not 'a' add +2, for each character that is 'a' add -1.</p>

<pre><code>S = aabab, count = 2

#count as you see characters

    a  a  b  a  b
    |  |  |  |  |
+2 -1 -1 +2 -1 +2 =&gt; 3

S = dog
+2 +2 +2 +2 =&gt; 8

S = babababa
+2 +2 -1 +2 -1 +2 -1 +2 -1 =&gt; 6

count = 2 + string.ToCharArray().Select(x =&gt; x == 'a' ? -1 : +2).ToArray().Sum();
//I've not tested this code
</code></pre>

<p>You just need one special case handling for <code>aaa</code>.   </p>

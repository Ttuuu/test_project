<p>This is something that my teacher came up with for a spell-checking task, but I've adapted it to make it work for you, and it adds a bit to my program as well. The variable names are a bit weird, because I've copied them straight from my program.</p>

<pre><code>inputfile=input("Enter the name (with file extension) of the file you would like to spellcheck: ")
fileToCheck = open(inputfile, 'rt') #opens the file
print("File found.")
textToCheck=[]
for line in fileToCheck:
    sentence=line.split() #splits it into words
    for word in sentence:
        textToCheck.append(word) #adds the rord to the list
fileToCheck.close()
print("File imported.")
print(str(len(textToCheck))+" words found in input file.") #prints the length of the list (number of words)
</code></pre>

<p>As for formatting it well, have you considered outputting the finished file as a HTML? You could use CSS, and maybe even basic Javascript to make it look good. This is how I did it:</p>

<p>(at start of program)</p>

<pre><code>import os
outputText="&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n&lt;title&gt;Document&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;style&gt;insert stuff here&lt;/style&gt;\n&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="linktocss.css"&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;Document&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;"
</code></pre>

<p>(at end of program)</p>

<pre><code>filename=inputfile+".html"
outputText+="&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;" #finishes off html
outputFile = open(filename, 'wt')
outputFile.write(outputText)
outputFile.close()
os.startfile(filename) #automatically open file
</code></pre>
    </div>

<p>Thanks for posting your code, it's great that you want to improve your style.
I created a small list of things you could improve. This list is probably not complete and different programmers may have different opinions but I tried to my best to be constructive and unopinionated.</p>

<ol>
<li><pre><code>some_var = True
while some_var:
    # Do something
    some_var = False
</code></pre>

<p>Is usually written as</p>

<pre><code>while True:
    # Do something
    break
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Global variables can make it harder to reason about functions. So instead of globally defining <code>pw_length</code>, just pass it as an argument to <code>passwordgenerator</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>It is a good rule of thumb that functions should only have one responsibility, so
instead of printing the password in <code>passwordgenerator</code> you should just return it and print it in you main function.</p></li>
<li><p><code>random.choice</code> selects a random element from a list
and <code>random.sample</code> selects <code>k</code> unique elements from a list.</p></li>
<li><p>Not allowing repetition makes the password more predictable. The same goes for using symbols only at specific locations.
So my final version would be:</p>

<pre><code>def passwordgenerator(pw_length):
    ALPHABET = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ!?@%#$"
    return ''.join([random.choice(ALPHABET) for _ in range(pw_length)]

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print("/!\ 12 Characters is a minimum for good security /!\ ")

    print("=" * 55)  # just to make it pretty

    while True:
        pw_length = input("How many Characters do you want?\n")

        if pw_length.isdigit():  # verify if user input a number
            pw_length = int(pw_length)
            mypw = passwordgenerator(pw_length)
            print(mypw)
            break
        else:
            print("A number is needed")
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<h1>Allocations can fail</h1>
<p>Don't use <code>buffer</code> until we know it's not null.  (And no need to multiply by <code>sizeof (char)</code>, since that's automatically a no-op).</p>
<p>Please remember to <code>free()</code> it too (at least as an option).  That reduces false positives with Valgrind's memory checker.</p>
<h1>I/O operations can fail</h1>
<p>Always check that your I/O succeeds.</p>
<p>Consider this scenario: we run the program in a directory containing a (hostile) <code>translation.py</code>.  The directory and the file are both read-only, so the <code>remove()</code> and the <code>fopen()</code> both fail, as do all the <code>fprintf()</code> calls using the invalid file descriptor.</p>
<p>Then we get to the call to <code>system()</code>.  What's the Python code that's executed?</p>
<h1>Use a temporary file</h1>
<p>Instead of assuming it's possible and desirable to overwrite <code>translation.py</code> in the current directory, perhaps we should <code>mktemp()</code> or similar, and remove the temporary file when we exit?</p>
<h1>Python source files are text</h1>
<p>It makes no difference on a POSIX system, but it's misleading to use <code>"b"</code> in the <code>fopen()</code> call.  We don't ever read from it, so don't need the <code>"+"</code>, and want to replace any existing file, not append (so we wouldn't need to <code>remove()</code>), so the open mode really should be plain <code>"w"</code>.</p>
<h1>Use the standard library</h1>
<p><code>translateString2Number</code> (and therefore also <code>power()</code>) can be replaced with a simple call to <code>sscanf</code> (since we know the numbers are all terminated by a non-digit).</p>
<p>In fact, if we can rely on the input being correctly formatted (and simply error out if it's wrong), we can just read all the input using <code>scanf()</code>, rather than allocating <code>buffer</code> to hold the entire input stream.</p>

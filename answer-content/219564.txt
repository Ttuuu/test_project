<h1>PEP-8</h1>

<ul>
<li>Python convention uses <code>snake_case</code> for variable and function names</li>
<li>Your spacing around numerical operators is not consistent</li>
</ul>

<h1>comments</h1>

<p>Your comments are clear and they explain why something is done</p>

<h1><code>payouts</code> list</h1>

<p>This list is unnecessary. You only use its last element and its length. Better would be to use just variables, just like a standard fibonacci generators, and <code>itertools.count</code> to keep track of the number of payouts</p>

<pre><code>def max_payouts(lambs):
    payout = 1
    for i in count():
        if lambs &lt;= 0:
            return i
        payout *= 2
        lambs -= payout


def min_payouts(lambs):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i in count():
        if lambs &lt;= 0:
            return i
        a, b = b, a + b
        lambs -= b

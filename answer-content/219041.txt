<p>No, it's not secure.</p>

<p>Your code is using <code>Random</code> instead of <code>SecureRandom</code>, which limits the entropy of the salt to 48 bits.</p>

<p>In addition, as an auditor I would immediately reject any "security code" that is implemented directly in the <code>main</code> method. To demonstrate that you understand the building blocks of a cipher, your code has to be structured into manageable methods that make the relation between the basic ingredients as clear as possible. The code should explain how the encryption works, without overwhelming the reader with needless technical details. Keeping track of 5 variables in your head is already difficult.</p>

<p>The outermost method should be <code>encrypt(InputStream in, OutputStream out, Key key, Random rnd)</code>. Only if you provide this kind of API can you write useful unit tests to demonstrate that the encryption code works for at least a few select examples.</p>

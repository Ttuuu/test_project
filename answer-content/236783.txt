<p>There's a couple small things I usually do differently that I'd like to point out:</p>

<pre><code>f = open("competitions.json","w")

# pretty prints and writes the same to the json file 
f.write(json.dumps(competitions,indent=4, sort_keys=False))
f.close()
</code></pre>

<p>Can be replaced with:</p>

<pre><code>with open("competitions.json","w") as f:
    # pretty prints and writes the same to the json file 
    f.write(json.dumps(competitions,indent=4, sort_keys=False))
</code></pre>

<p>Which prevents leaving files open by accident.</p>

<p>You also do:</p>

<pre><code>page = 0 #starting value of page
while True:

    # stuff

    page += 1
    if page == response["pageInfo"]["numPages"]:
        break
</code></pre>

<p>Which can be replaced by:</p>

<pre><code>for page in range(response["pageInfo"]["numPages"]):
</code></pre>

<p>The assignment of dictionaries can also be done nicer imo. Instead of:</p>

<pre><code>games_unplayed[game["id"]] = game['id']
fixtures_unplayed[games_unplayed[game["id"]]] = {"match": {}}
fixtures_unplayed[games_unplayed[game["id"]]]['match'] = game['id']
fixtures_unplayed[games_unplayed[game["id"]]]['kickoff'] = game['fixtureType']
fixtures_unplayed[games_unplayed[game["id"]]]['preli_date'] = game['provisionalKickoff']['label']
fixtures_unplayed[games_unplayed[game["id"]]]['scientific_date'] = game['provisionalKickoff']['millis']
fixtures_unplayed[games_unplayed[game["id"]]]['home_team'] = game['teams'][0]['team']['name']
fixtures_unplayed[games_unplayed[game["id"]]]['home_team_id'] = game['teams'][0]['team']['club']['id']
fixtures_unplayed[games_unplayed[game["id"]]]['home_team_abbr'] = game['teams'][0]['team']['club']['abbr']
fixtures_unplayed[games_unplayed[game["id"]]]['away_team'] = game['teams'][1]['team']['name']
fixtures_unplayed[games_unplayed[game["id"]]]['away_team_id'] = game['teams'][1]['team']['club']['id']
fixtures_unplayed[games_unplayed[game["id"]]]['away_team_abbr'] = game['teams'][1]['team']['club']['abbr']
fixtures_unplayed[games_unplayed[game["id"]]]['grounds'] = game['ground']['name']
fixtures_unplayed[games_unplayed[game["id"]]]['grounds_id'] = game['ground']['id']
fixtures_unplayed[games_unplayed[game["id"]]]['gameweek'] = game['gameweek']['gameweek']
fixtures_unplayed[games_unplayed[game["id"]]]['status'] = game['status']
</code></pre>

<p>Use:</p>

<pre><code>game_id = game['id']
index = games_unplayed[game_id]

fixtures_unplace[index] = \
    {'match': game_id,
     'kickoff': game['fixtureType'],
     'preli_date': game['provisionalKickoff']['label'],
     'scientific_date': game['provisionalKickoff']['millis'],
     'home_team': game['teams'][0]['team']['name'],
     'home_team_id': game['teams'][0]['team']['club']['id'],
     'home_team_abbr': game['teams'][0]['team']['club']['abbr'],
     'away_team': game['teams'][1]['team']['name'],
     'away_team_id': game['teams'][1]['team']['club']['id'],
     'away_team_abbr': game['teams'][1]['team']['club']['abbr'],
     'grounds': game['ground']['name'],
     'grounds_id': game['ground']['id'],
     'gameweek': game['gameweek']['gameweek'],
     'status': game['status']}
</code></pre>

<p>Lastly, not that important, but I don't like to hardcode values:</p>

<pre><code>def __init__(self):
    self.base_url = 'https://footballapi.pulselive.com/football'
</code></pre>

<p>Could also be:</p>

<pre><code>def __init__(self, base_url = 'https://footballapi.pulselive.com/football'):
    self.base_url = base_url
</code></pre>

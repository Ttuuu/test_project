<p>On the advice of AJD I've made some changes to the initial code from my question, which I think constitutes an answer.</p>

<p>The main issue with the code in the original post is working with the input range. But by storing the range's data as an array, the function performs much more quickly.</p>

<pre><code>Function r_sum(r1 As Range) As Long

    Dim arr As Variant
    arr = r1.Value

    For Each a In arr
        r_sum = r_sum + a
    Next a

End Function
</code></pre>

<p>In this way, I can supply my functions with an entire column or row range (or even multiple) and expect that the function will perform its calculations quickly enough for me to use them.</p>

<p>That is basically what I was hoping for, and so I consider my question answered.</p>

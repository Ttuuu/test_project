<ul>
<li><p>First thing I would do is to refactor your code and redesign it following the functional or OOP concepts. As it is right now, your code is shaped according to an old school of doing things (sequential programming).</p></li>
<li><p>Personally, I would remove all your comments because they are distracting and they bring noise to your code. For the comments you really think can be useful, you will need to write them in in a better way. You can take the example of that comment following your SSH socket: it is a too long comment that need to span in multiple shorter lines instead, and put before that instruction.</p></li>
<li>There are also few details you need to pay attention to: for example, lines can not be left empty randomly just like that. Also, the space between operands is better to avoid when passing arguments to a function (For example, write <code>ssh.connect(hostname=name, username=user, key_filename=key_file)</code> instead of <code>ssh.connect(hostname = name, username = user, key_filename = key_file)</code> and <code>stdin, stdout, stderr = ssh.exec_command(command)</code> instead of <code>stdin, stdout, stderr = ssh.exec_command (command)</code></li>
</ul>

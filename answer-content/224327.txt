<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>Works as intended.<br>
But I get a thread priority of 15 rather than the expected 31 for a <code>REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS</code>?<br>
See <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-setthreadpriority" rel="nofollow noreferrer">SetThreadPriority</a>.</p>

<p>It seems that the <code>THREAD_PRIORITY_TIME_CRITICAL</code> is defined to <code>THREAD_BASE_PRIORITY_LOWRT - 1</code>, which could be further elevated to 31 if needed.</p>
    </div>

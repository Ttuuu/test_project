<p><strong>Throwaway memory</strong></p>

<p>I haven't done any analysis on the code but based on my experience the worst part is the allocation of throwaway memory inside the innermost loop. Instead of allocating a 3x3 array 9 million times and throwing it to the garbage colletor immediately, allocate it once at the start of the method and reuse it in the loop.</p>

<pre><code>int[][] kernel = new int[][] { ... }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Repeated calculations</strong></p>

<p>Second obvious thing is the repeating of same mathematical operations. You calculate the right and bottom border several times inside the innermost loop even though the result never changes during the image processing. Calculate these at the start of the method and store the results to local variables:</p>

<pre><code>sourceImage.getHeight() - 1
sourceImage.getWidth() - 1
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Sacrifice readability for performance</strong></p>

<p>After solving the obvious parts, you can start breaking good coding conventions. The only reason you have those mile long unreadable ternary operations is to handle the edge cases that affect 0.1% of your data. Take out the easy code inside the edges that covers 99.9% of your running time, that doesn't need any bounds checking, and make it as fast as possible. Then make a separate loop that handle only the edges.</p>

<p><strong>Bad variable naming</strong></p>

<p>The choice of loop variables are bad. <code>Width</code> and <code>height</code> are constants of the image that refer to the right and bottom border. You are using these names to refer to single pixels inside the image. The correct names here would be <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>. This makes following your code extremely difficult.</p>

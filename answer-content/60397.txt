<p><strong>Efficiency</strong></p>

<p>I don't think that can be improved. You're only using two if-statements. This is as efficient as it can get, I believe.</p>

<p><strong>Cleaner</strong></p>

<p>Depends on if you consider the conditional operator <code>?:</code> clean or not.</p>

<pre><code>public static Direction vectorToDirection(Vector2 vector) {
    if (vector.y &gt;= 0) {
        return vector.x &gt;= 0 ? NORTH_EAST : NORTH_WEST;
    } else {
        return vector.x &gt;= 0 ? SOUTH_EAST : SOUTH_WEST;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This code does exactly the same as your previous code, it's just a different way of writing it.</p>

<p>In my opinion, it would be foolish to try and reduce it more than this. Be happy with this one. Good job.</p>

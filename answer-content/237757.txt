<p>Covering what others suggested (e.g. @Srivaths), please follow at least PEP8 <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python PEP8</a></p>

<p>Then, put your code in some function.
Give meaningful names to variables. (What's a, c, x, z ... why are you not using b? )</p>

<p>You don't need <code>import math</code> -- instead of <code>f=row/2
f=math.ceil(f)</code>, you can do <code>f = row // 2</code> (assuming you use python 3). </p>

<p>Note that you can solve the problem more generally, for m x n matrix, which you can initialize as:
<code>matrix = [[0 for col in range(nCols)] for row in range(nRows)]</code>
(see the answer from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4056768/how-to-declare-array-of-zeros-in-python-or-an-array-of-a-certain-size/4056782">StackOverflow</a>, provided by @OK).
This
 <code>matrix = [[0] * m] * n</code>, as pointed in the comments, won't work because of list references.</p>

<p>Now, we can also observe that you can fill the "outer rectangle", i.e. matrix[0][:] = range(1, nCols + 1); then, you can fill the rightmost column </p>

<pre><code>cnt += nCols
for row in range(1, nRows):
  matrix[row][rightIdx] = cnt
  cnt += 1
# Bottom row:
matrix[bottomIdx][leftIdx:] = reversed(range(cnt, cnt + nCols - 1) # might be off by 1;
# Complete first column

# Put this in a while loop;
</code></pre>

<p>This problem is similar -- once you have the matrix, print it in a spiral order:

<p>Also, you can check the solution of LeetCode Prob 54, but I would encourage you to try solving the problem yourself first.

<p>And here is my solution to Problem 54, similar to Solution 2 (Leetcode Solution link above): <a href="https://gist.github.com/mcimpoi/13848804099e3460e59967e43040ac7f" rel="nofollow noreferrer">My solution :)</a></p>

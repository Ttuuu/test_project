<p>I'd say you have the following options:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Keep that new class</strong> if you think it's relevant in your business. Here, it should be important to know if the logic of calculate the distance should be on that web service (I assume that 'ws' variable means that) or within your model (i.e., the 'Agent' class).</li>
<li><strong>Use an anonymous class</strong> if you think you won't pass that info to another method.</li>
<li><strong>Use a dictionary</strong> if you think it's not relevant in your business but will pass that info to another method.</li>
</ol>

<p>Personally, I'd go for the first one since it's the most natural to me. By the way, I'd use LINQ's OrderBy instead of implementing the IComparable interface; again, for expressiveness.</p>

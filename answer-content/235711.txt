<p>There is no identifiable difference between your table's column names and your preferred keys, but if you want to alter the keys, just build that into your SELECT clause -- this is what "aliases" are for.</p>

<p>Suppose you wanted to capitalize each column name, here's how that could look:</p>

<pre><code>$stmt = $conn-&gt;prepare("SELECT name AS Name,
                               company AS Company,
                               email AS Email,
                               phone AS Phone,
                               address AS Address
                        FROM tickets_info
                        WHERE ticket = ?");
$stmt-&gt;execute([$_POST['ticket']]);
$ticket = $stmt-&gt;fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC) ?: [];
</code></pre>

<p>Note, I am not using a loop.  Your snippet is overwriting itself in the loop, so I am interpreting that to mean that <code>ticket</code> is a PRIMARY/UNIQUE column.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you want to extract all columns from your table and use the column names as keys, you don't need to change your original query.</p>

<pre><code>$stmt = $conn-&gt;prepare("SELECT * FROM tickets_info WHERE ticket = ?");
$stmt-&gt;execute([$_POST['ticket']]);
$ticket = $stmt-&gt;fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC) ?: [];
</code></pre>
    </div>

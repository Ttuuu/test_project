<blockquote>
  <p>Is the main function just too long? Should I have broken it into smaller functions?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's kind of long but not overly so. The first thing I would look for is elimination of redundancies. For example, in the last section there's no need to compare <code>abs(numer) &gt; abs(denom)</code> because you will end up with the same <code>max(shared)</code> in both cases. You can cut out a whole lot of code that way.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the first if block in simplify_fraction() fraction the 'else' part ends with 'pass'. Wasn't sure what else to do there? Or if that is fine as is?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>else:</code> clause is not required in Python. You can just delete that (and the <code>pass</code>) and the logic will be unchanged.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since I use the abs() function numerous times for numer and denom variable, would I have been better to make a variable out of it so that the calculation is only done once?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Probably, yes. </p>

<p>Other things I noticed:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You have tests like <code>negative == True</code>. There is no need to compare against <code>True</code> because <code>negative</code> is already <code>True</code> or <code>False</code> (a boolean value). For <code>negative == False</code> use <code>not negative</code>. </p></li>
<li><p>The reduction of something like <code>15/5</code> would be <code>3/1</code>, but the reduction of <code>3/1</code> would be just <code>3</code>. An additional challenge would be to make the output always in the most simple form, particularly if that is an integer.</p></li>
<li><p>Your call to <code>simplify_fraction</code> contains two <code>raw_input</code> function calls. (I assume the fact that they both ask for a numerator is a typo.) The point I'd like to make here is that while I'm pretty sure Python always evaluates function arguments left to right, this is definitely <em>not</em> true in all languages. I would write that line as something like the following, to make it unambiguous:</p>

<pre><code>num = int(raw_input("Type in numerator &gt;"))
den = int(raw_input("Type in denominator &gt;"))
print simplify_fraction(num, den)
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

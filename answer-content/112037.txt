<p>The answer from @chillworld answer your question but there is still some really smalls details in your code. </p>

<p>I like that you're using <code>import static</code> for the <code>assert</code>s statement. This leave the code free from the repetitive <code>Assert.assertNull</code>.</p>

<p>The problem is you're cluterring the code with comments that serve no purpose.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>        //Mocking the static function getCurrentInstance from FacesContext, 
        //so a mocked user can be returned for the test
        PowerMockito.mockStatic(FacesContext.class);
        PowerMockito.when(FacesContext.getCurrentInstance()).thenReturn(facesContext);
        when(facesContext.getExternalContext()).thenReturn(externalContext);
        when(externalContext.getSessionMap()).thenReturn(sessionMap);
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Your code is clean enough that you don't have to explain yourself with comment that are just what the code is doing. Reserve comments for when you need to take my attention to something special, something unusual that by reading the code I would not understand immediately. </p>

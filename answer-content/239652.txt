<p>As far as I can see in the code example you've provided, it seems that the <code>getStatistics</code> and <code>recordClickedLink</code> methods are independent of each other. So it seems intuitive to have in this case two controllers: a <code>StatisticsController</code> and a something like a <code>RecordController</code> where the two methods <code>recordClickedLink</code> and <code>canRecordClick</code> live. In that way the <code>StatisticsController</code> is responsible for statisics and the <code>RecordController</code> for the record.</p>

<p>It is ok that the class contains <code>canRecordClick</code>, but <code>protected</code> means that any class extending the <code>StatisticsController</code> will be able to call this method too. If it will only be used in the <code>StatisticsController</code>, <code>private</code> would be better.</p>

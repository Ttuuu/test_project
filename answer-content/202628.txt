<p>Your instincts are good to dislike that bit of code. </p>

<p>Whenever you can, you should put code in data structures rather than in control statements. It makes the code clearer and easier to maintain.</p>

<p>So for instance you could put your settings in a hash table like this:</p>

<pre><code>$FrequencySettings = @{
    Once     = @{Once   = $true}
    Daily    = @{Daily  = $true}
    Weekly   = @{Weekly = $true; WeeksInterval = 1; DaysOfWeek = 'Monday'}
    Monthly  = @{Weekly = $true; WeeksInterval = 4; DaysOfWeek = 'Monday'}
    }

# Let's test it:
$FrequencyParams = $FrequencySettings['Monthly']
New-ScheduledTaskTrigger @FrequencyParams -At "0:00"
</code></pre>

<p>I haven't checked that the particular settings I've put in above are all correct. I just want to show you the basic idea.</p>

<p>A more compact and extensible solution would be to use <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms974570.aspx" rel="nofollow">pattern matching</a> to try and take common parts of your field names and use them to map the uneven field headers you get in your csv files.</p>

<p>But I don't think this will work in your case, because you don't seem to have common patterns for all your field names. For instance, <code>adress</code> and <code>street</code> are field headers that should match to the <code>Address</code> field, but as you can see, there's no common usable pattern there. And in cases where there is a common pattern like <code>cust</code>, it won't work either because it could be for the fields <code>CustName</code> or <code>CustNo</code>. </p>

<p>So in this particular case I think you will definitively need to provide the full list of possible field names for each field. Now, you can do this in a more compact way using a <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/vbscript/vbscript_dictionary_objects.htm" rel="nofollow">VBScript dictionary</a> that allows you to check in one line if certain field name (key) exists using <code>dict.Exists(key)</code>, or see the field address matching a particular field name using <code>dict.item(key)</code>. You still need to add all possible combinations of field names and addresses to the dictionary, but after doing that (just one time), you can use your dictionary very efficiently to get the address for all your headers. </p>

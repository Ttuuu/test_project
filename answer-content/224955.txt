<p>A bug (or poorly-specified behaviour):</p>

<p>If we enter an invalid triangle (e.g. <code>1, 2, 4</code>), the program reports that it's scalene, before telling us that it's not a valid triangle.  That's a contradiction - if it's not a triangle, it cannot be a scalene triangle!</p>

<p>I recommend performing the <code>is_valid_triangle()</code> test first, and only continuing to classify the triangle if the test is successful.</p>

<p>And don't forget that valid triangles have three <em>positive</em> sides - any negative values should fail the validity test.</p>

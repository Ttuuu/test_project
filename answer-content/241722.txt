<p>A few points to consider.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>C99 added an actual Boolean type, named <code>_Bool</code>, with constants name <code>_True</code> and <code>_False</code>. By including <code>&lt;stdboolh.h&gt;</code>, you get aliases for those spelled <code>bool</code>, <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>. So unless you need to continue using C89, you might consider using these instead of defining your own names and such.</p></li>
<li><p>When you have a value that's conceptually Boolean in nature (e.g., your <code>previous_space</code>) I'd treat it as a Boolean, so to test if it's <code>false</code>, I'd prefer to use <code>if (!previous_space)</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Rather than explicitly checking for every possible white-space character in-line, I'd prefer to move that check into a separately little function of its own. Only this is such a common requirement that the standard library already provides <code>isspace</code>, so (at least in real code) it's generally preferred to <code>#include &lt;ctype.h&gt;</code>, and us that (but the book probably hasn't introduced this yet, so I wouldn't worry about it a whole lot just yet).</p></li>

<p>You have correctly implemented the optimization <code>p ** 2 &gt; upperlimit</code>, but, there is a more efficient way to do it...</p>

<p><code>p ** 2 &gt; upperlimit</code> calculates the square of <code>p</code> for every iteration through the loop. The product is not hugely expensive, but it is also totally unnecessary....</p>

<p>You can calculate the square-root of the upperlimit just once, and then reuse that calculated value as a direct comparison for <code>p</code>. Consider:</p>

<pre><code>rootlimit = math.sqrt(upperlimit)
for p in l:
    if p &gt; rootlimit:
        break;
    ....
</code></pre>

<p>Additionally, it is a small thing, but if you have <code>break</code>, <code>continue</code>, or <code>return</code>, inside a conditional inside a loop, then there is no need to use <code>elif</code>... It is just a small thing, but your code could be:</p>

<pre><code>rootlimit = math.sqrt(upperlimit)
for p in l:
    if p &gt; rootlimit:
        break;
    if p:
        ....
</code></pre>

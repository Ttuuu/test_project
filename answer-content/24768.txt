<p>I would start by removing duplication.  If you pass in the mark that the player being checked is using, then you can eliminate 1/2 your code.</p>

<pre><code>def CheckVictory(board, x, y, mark):

    if board[x][0] == (mark) and board[x][1] == (mark) and board [x][2] == (mark):
           return True

    if board[0][y] == (mark) and board[1][y] == (mark) and board [2][y] == (mark):
           return True

    #check if previous move was on the main diagonal and caused a win
    if board[0][0] == (mark) and board[1][1] == (mark) and board [2][2] == (mark):
           return True

    #check if previous move was on the secondary diagonal and caused a win
    if board[0][2] == (mark) and board[1][1] == (mark) and board [2][0] == (mark):
           return True    

    return False 

#end of CheckVictory function

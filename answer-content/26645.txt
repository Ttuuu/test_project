<p>This is a case where lambdas and a library of higher-order functions are very useful. For example in C#, both of your methods are pretty much one-liners:</p>

<pre><code>public bool IsThereALeader(List&lt;Member&gt; team)
{
    return team.Any(member =&gt; member.Role == "Leader");
}

public bool AreThereAtLeast2NewJoiners(List&lt;Member&gt; team)
{
    DateTime aMonthAgo = DateTime.Now.AddMonths(-1);
    return team.Count(member =&gt; member.StartingDate &gt; aMonthAgo) &gt;= 2;
}
</code></pre>

<p>(The second method will iterate the whole collection even if it finds two new joiners early on, but that's not likely to matter.)</p>

<p>In Java, you can emulate lambdas using anonymous classes, but the syntax is <em>much</em> more verbose (and I don't know if there is a library that provides the required helper functions).</p>

<p>There are also some libraries listed at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/1217228/41071">the Stack Overflow question <em>What is the Java equivalent for LINQ?</em></a> that you could use for this purpose.</p>

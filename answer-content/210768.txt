<p>Welcome to Code Review.  I am sorry but I do not find your code as comprehensible as you were hoping.  I find myself more aligned to the comment by @t3chb0t.</p>

<p>I really must ask have you ever read any parts of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/naming-guidelines" rel="noreferrer">C# Naming Guidelines</a>?  I am not saying that to be mean. Given that you are a new poster, we do try to be nice but unfortunately sometimes a certain bluntness cannot be avoided.</p>

<p>Something to also consider is that you should <strong>favor composition over inheritance</strong> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance" rel="noreferrer">Wikipedia link</a>).  Here is a good <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/53354/2152078">StackOverflow link</a> on it too.  Rather than class <code>Encoder</code> implementing <code>List&lt;byte&gt;</code>, it would be better to have a private field of <code>List&lt;byte&gt;</code>.  This also prevents someone from inadvertently performing any method that modifies the encoded value, such as an Add, Clear, or Remove.  You could then expose that field publicly as a read only value. </p>

<p>You have a fair amount in a section related to the intermediate circular buffer.  This bugs me for several reasons.  For one, I think the buffer, variables, and methods could be put into its own class, even if its a private internal class.  And having variable names being with "I" conflicts with the naming guideline on many fronts: (1) variables should begin with lowercase letters, and (2) a capital "I" makes me think its an <strong>I</strong>nterface.</p>

<p>I applaud you for emphasizing simple and concise over efficient.  Next I would urge you think strongly about readability.  Ask yourself how well a mediocre C# developer would understand your code without having to ask you questions about it.</p>

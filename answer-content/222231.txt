<p>Don't use mutable default arguments. If you need to default to a list then default to <code>None</code> and then change to an empty list.</p>

<p>Take the following example code:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def example_list_builder(value, list_=[]):
    list_.append(value)
    return list_

&gt;&gt;&gt; example_list_builder(1)
[1]
&gt;&gt;&gt; example_list_builder(2)
[1, 2]
</code></pre>

<p>This makes <code>list_</code> a really poorly defined singleton variable, that can't be accessed globally.</p>

<hr>

<p>Your code looks like it's something like <span class="math-container">\$O(6^n)\$</span> where <span class="math-container">\$n\$</span> is the size of the board.</p>

<p>You can instead make it <span class="math-container">\$O(l^2)\$</span> where <span class="math-container">\$l\$</span> is <code>LADDERS</code> and <code>SNAKES</code>.</p>

<p>To improve your code, you should remove the simulation and instead only work with the <code>LADDERS</code> and <code>SNAKES</code> variables.</p>

<p>For each snake and ladder you should traverse it, and then traverse the snake or ladder after this. You should note the distance, there are two ways to do this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Least tiles visited.</li>
<li>Least turns taken.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the latter, you'll have to check for collisions with other snakes and ladders.</p>

<p>You should take snakes into account, as the fastest path for the following is 4 turns:</p>

<pre><code>NUMBER_SQUARES = 1000
LADDERS = {1: 502, 501: 999}
SNAKES = {503: 500}
</code></pre>

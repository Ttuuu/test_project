<pre><code>guess = input()

<p>Why are you splitting this on to two different lines? You can just merge the <code>int()</code> onto the line above it, and pass <code>input()</code> into it like this:</p>

<pre><code>guess = int(input())
</code></pre>

<p>As <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/9717/greg-hewgill">Greg Hewgill</a> mentioned in the comments, rather than saying this:</p>

<pre><code>print('if you gussed less than 6 times you won')
</code></pre>

<p>You should actually count up and tell the user if they won.</p>

<p>This can be done by using a simple counter for how many times the user has made an attempt. Then, every time the code loops (they enter an answer), you just increment the counter:</p>

<pre><code>num = random.randint(1, 100)
attempts = 0
while True:
    attempts += 1
</code></pre>

<p>Then, at the end of your code and after the loop, you just need to set up some simple conditionals that check the <code>attempts</code> variable:</p>

<pre><code>if attempts &lt; 6:
    print("You won!")
else:
    print("You lost!")
</code></pre>

<p>Then, to take this step further and reduce <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47882/what-is-a-magic-number-and-why-is-it-bad">magic numbers</a>, create a <strong>constant</strong> at the top of your code that defines the number of attempts at which the user has lost.</p>

<p>That is done like this:</p>

<pre><code>ATTEMPTS_FOR_LOSE = 6
</code></pre>

<p>Then, you just substitute the <code>6</code> for <code>ATTEMPTS_FOR_LOST</code> in the conditional snippet I showed a little above.</p>

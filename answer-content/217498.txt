<p>As no other answer has mentioned this - I feel it's worth pointing out by itself.</p>

<p>In your current example, you are writing the results directly to <code>stdout</code> as soon as they are found. This works well for toy examples, and as it gives you the output you desire - it's often an easy habit to get into.</p>

<p>However, doing it this way requires a human to verify and test the output each time a change is made.</p>

<p>Instead of writing results directly to stdout; try to separate the business logic from the output itself. That is, write the logic in a function which returns the results. In this specific case, you may want to return a list/vector of structs, representing each result as calculated:</p>

<pre><code>   struct Result {  
       bool success;  
       int input_a;  
       int input_b;  
       int input_c;  
       int calculated_abc;  
       int calculated_fa_fb_fc_total;     
    };
</code></pre>

<p>Once separate, you'll have a function that can be run by "other code" (such as in a test framework), allowing you to write automated tests that check this code is always correct for a given set of inputs.</p>

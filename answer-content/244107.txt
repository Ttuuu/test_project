<p>You're using RxJS, but your inputs and outputs are plain arrays. It'd be simpler to either consume and return streams or replace RxJS with Lodash/Ramda/Underscore/native array methods/some iteration-based library.</p>
<p>(If you want to get really fancy or need to use the function in different contexts, you could write a <a href="https://ramdajs.com/docs/#transduce" rel="nofollow noreferrer">transducer</a>.)</p>
<p>You're using a class, a method and a static property, but it would be sufficient to have a type, a function and a module-local constant. And passing <code>datePipe</code> (or just a <code>Date</code>) and <code>status =&gt; getPointsFromStatusToPointsMap(status)</code> function as arguments would make the dependencies more explicit. But these are more like code style preferences.</p>
<p>Lastly, you're returning <code>any</code>, but you should always return <code>unknown</code> instead unless you really have to lie to the type system for some reason. And returning <code>[string, number]</code> or <code>[Date, number]</code> would be more convenient for the consumer.</p>

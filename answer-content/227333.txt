<p>There are many ways you could implement polling but this one is valid enough for a lot of cases.  You could hide your timer off in a redux action somewhere if you were so inclined.</p>

<p>It's worth highlighting that you should clear out your timer when the Component unmounts.</p>

<pre><code>componentWillUnmount() {
    window.clearInterval(this.timer)
}
</code></pre>
    </div>

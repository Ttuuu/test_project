<p>Your code is well written, there are some things that i would like to point out.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You should pass both ranges via iterators, so that it works on other random-access containers like <code>std::array</code></p></li>
<li><p>That way the missing <code>const</code> for indices would not hurt too much</p></li>
<li><p>This is a personal preference, but I would almost always put define the lambda separately. In the end one of the major advantages that lambdas have are descriptive names. In the end it is a single line longer but <em>much</em> more readable.</p></li>
<li><p>I think the algorithm itself is sub-optimal @papagada wrote an excellent version so i wont comment on it further</p></li>
</ol>

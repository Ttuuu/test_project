<p>It's good that you are getting that feeling that something isn't right. You are violating the single responsibility principle. Your view controller should only be responsible for it's view hierarchy, not the data that drives the view hierarchy.</p>

<p>You should create a data model/context to encapsulate the logic around the user verification status. You can observe changes in that model to update your UI.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a data model and optionally a context around that data.</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>    @interface User

    @property (nonatomic, readonly) BOOL idUploading;
    @property (nonatomic, readonly) BOOL idUploaded;
    @property (nonatomic, readonly) BOOL verified;

    @end
</code></pre>

<p>The implementation of the data model/context updates the properties based on the verification status.</p>

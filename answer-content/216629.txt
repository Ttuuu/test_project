<p>If you're not worried about performance, you can replace all the manual work by using the <code>&lt;regex&gt;</code> facilities, which results in a considerable reduction of code to test and maintain.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;regex&gt;

source = std::regex_replace(source, std::regex("â‚¬"), "\x80");
</code></pre>

<p>I would still keep it in a separate function to make it easy to change the implementation afterwards.</p>

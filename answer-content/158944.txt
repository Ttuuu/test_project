<p><strong>As per features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>It would be nice if I didn't have to press Enter after each letter. Use unbuffered input. Same goes with Tier 1/2 and Yes/No. This way, you don't even have to use the "Please enter only 1 letter" message.</li>
<li>If you don't necessarily want this to be platform-independent, you should use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/curses.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">curses</a> window and clear it after each letter so the gallows will stay on top of the screen instead of repeating again and again. You could then improve by updating only those parts of screen which need updating (eg. the gallows and letters).</li>
<li>Explain what is the difference between Tier 1 and Tier 2.</li>
<li>Perhaps let the user provide a file with words to choose from. Would be simple enough to implement.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Other remarks:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>In function <code>wordLength</code>, you forgot to account for invalid input. This results in a <code>TypeError</code>. You should print an error message and ask again.</li>
<li>Sometimes, at the end when I loose and the program prints the word, it's clearly incorrect. Eg. letters are <code>m---</code> and it says <code>the word was llama</code>.</li>
<li>The function <code>GetRandomWord</code> seems pointless, it's the same as <code>random.choice</code>. If the argument is called <code>words</code>, then <code>GetRandomWord(words)</code> is not much more readable than <code>random.choice(words)</code>. Although, one might argue that if you wanted to switch to another implementation of <code>choice</code>, it would be easier. But my guess is that wasn't your intention.</li>
<li>Create a main function and check if <code>__name__ == '__main__'</code>. If yes, call that main function, otherwise don't do anything. It might not be necessary in this program, but if someone else wanted to use functions from your module, they would have to import it. And when they do, your game is going to start playing, which is not what they want.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's 5 things I noticed right away:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><code>errorChecks(process.argv)</code> is probably best before you try to parse the arguments. Some of that parsing is going to fail before getting to your nice error messages.</p></li>
<li><p>Edit your tests-- remove boilerplate ones and give the remaining ones good names.</p></li>
<li><p>You have some temporary variables where you don't need them:
<code>
let isCurrency = currencies.includes(currency);
return isCurrency
</code>
Can just be <code>return currencies.includes(currency)</code>. (And any <code>let</code> that is not modified is better as a <code>const</code>.)</p></li>
<li><p>This logic seems flawed unless you're restricted to CAD and US$: <code>Math.round(cAmount * 100) / 100</code></p></li>
<li><p>I think:
<code>
let currencies = [];
for(let k in response.rates) currencies.push(k);
return currencies;
</code>
can simply be <code>return response.rates</code>.</p></li>
</ol>

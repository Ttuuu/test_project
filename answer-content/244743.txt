<h1>Code structure</h1>
<p>Treat <code>main.c</code> as boss who calls other people up to do their job. In this case, functions where one function does one thing. <code>main</code> is doing <em>everything</em> here.</p>
<pre><code>else{
 printf("No. The correct answer is %.0d. Need to practice more!\n\n", c);
 system("pause");
 system("cls");
}
</code></pre>
<p>This error message can be one function which receives one input <code>c</code>.</p>
<p>The whole block of <code>if (choice == a_number)</code> can go to one function with a better description. It makes maintaining the code much more easier. Debugging, extending functionality and having someone else read/ review your code becomes easy too.</p>
<h1>Variables.</h1>
<p>They can certainly have better names than alphabets. It reduces chances of unintentional editing. Describe what a variable stores: an incoming argument ? a return value ? indices ? <code>a</code> doesn't tell anything about what it stores. So whenever I encounter it, I'll have to check all the places where <code>a</code> was modified to see what it is doing.</p>
<h1>clang-format</h1>
<p>Please use <code>clang-format</code> to improve readability and consistent coding-style. Also it saves the manual effort of remembering to add indent or move braces etc.</p>

<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>As I wrote in my edit of the question, I came to the following solution, which I think could be better optimized, but does the job:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT *
    , MAX(numericphase.phase) OVER (PARTITION BY numericphase.uuid) AS s
    FROM (
        SELECT *
        , CASE
            WHEN status = 'REM' THEN 4
            WHEN status = 'FIN' THEN 3
            WHEN status = 'START' THEN 2
            WHEN status = 'CONF' THEN 1
            ELSE -1
        END AS phase
        FROM mytable
    ) numericphase
) lastphase
WHERE phase != 4
AND s = phase
AND s &gt; 0
</code></pre>
    </div>

<p>As you are not using <code>;</code> consistently I would say that your init style is dangerous as it will block automatic colon insertion.</p>

<p>For example the following lines will throw a syntax error <code>SyntaxError: Unexpected token '{'</code></p>

<pre><code> var a = foo{ 
    // init stuff
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Or syntax error <code>Missing initializer in destructuring declaration</code></p>

<pre><code> var a = 0,{
    // init stuff
 }
</code></pre>

<p>In a sea of code this type of typo is easily overlooked. Though it is a syntax error so will not lay in wait (in most normal situations)</p>

<p>When you allow the <code>;</code> to be inserted by moving the <code>{</code> to a new line it is safer.</p>

<pre><code> var a = foo
 { 
    // init stuff
 }
</code></pre>

<p>however the concern is that you are doing more than simple assignment within the block which could lead to situation such as</p>

<pre><code> var a = {}
 {
     let a.bar = foo  // was meant to be a.bar = foo
 }
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>let</code> is a typo but will not get caught until the code is run.</p>

<p>If you do continue to use this style I would recommend you use semicolons and be very strict in regards to the extent of the setup code within the block.</p>

<p>Personally I think its ugly.</p>

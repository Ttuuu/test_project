<h2>Setting <code>isAccessible</code> to true</h2>

<p>You seem to be always settings <code>isAccessible</code> to true. This is only needed if you are accessing methods outside their "access modifier", for example if you are trying to access a private method from another class.</p>

<p>Since you are only calling public methods (on public classes), this is not required.</p>

<h2>Support for <code>javax.tools</code> is not for all android versions</h2>

<p>You are using packages from <code>javax.tools</code>, this is not available on every android version, see the following SO question: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/18007280/1542723">NoClassDefFoundException when using javax.tools package</a>, make sure to properly test on the oldest android version you are targetting.</p>

<p>To avoid these packages, manually define a class using byte arrays, and load that instead of the output of the compilation</p>

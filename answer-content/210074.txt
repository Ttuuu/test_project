<p>I'm fairly new in C, so feel free to ignore me, however, this section concerned me:</p>

<pre><code>    size_t input_len = get_console_input(input_buffer, 255);
         if (input_len &lt;= 0) {
          printf("No password inserted, aborting...\n");
          return ERR_OK;
        }
</code></pre>

<p>You've set an input length of 255, great.  I noticed no error trapping for someone entering a length greater than 255. This could lead to buffer overflow attacks, since this program is expected to run as root level.    </p>

<p>I'd suggest adding a routine for that, similar to the one that you've added to detect 0 characters entered.   </p>

<p>Love the fact that you've ended with a cleanup command and the following two free commands!</p>

<p>Did some reading during the past few days about clean code and I can spot a bit of complexity in yours. Just some things that I think would improve the readability:</p>

<p>Multiple similar blocks like :</p>

<pre><code>        states[write] = states1[read1];
        offsets[write] = offsets1[read1];
        write++;
        read1++;
</code></pre>

<p>if this could be refactored into a function it would mean a + for readability.</p>

<p>Because of the <code>else if</code> I would also replace</p>

<pre><code>      if (diff &lt; 0)
        {
            states[write] = states1[read1];
            ---
        }
        else if (diff &gt; 0)
        {
            states[write] = states2[read2];
            ---
        }
        else
        {
            throw new InvalidOperationException ....
        }
</code></pre>

<p>with:</p>

<pre><code>if (diff == 0)
   throw new ....

if (diff &gt; 0)
{
   ...
}
else
{
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>This also looks like duplicate code:</p>

<pre><code>    while (read1 &lt; states1.Length)
    {
        states[write] = states1[read1];
        offsets[write] = offsets1[read1];
        write++;
        read1++;
    }

    while (read2 &lt; states2.Length)
    {
        states[write] = states2[read2];
        offsets[write] = offsets2[read2] + offset;
        write++;
        read2++;
    }
</code></pre>
    </div>

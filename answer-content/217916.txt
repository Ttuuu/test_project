<p>When you roll the die (not role), the result is one of:</p>

<pre><code>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   rand() % 10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  + 1
0 0 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3   / 3
</code></pre>

<p>Rolling a 0 is not fun. Whenever I roll the die, something should happen.</p>

<hr>

<p>When I read the code from top to bottom, I wondered what the magic number 9 had to do with the player. Further down in the code I learned that the board is restricted to 9 spaces. This number 9 should not appear in the <code>Player</code> class, but only in the <code>Board</code> class. And even the it should not be the literal 9, but <code>spaces.size()</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>In <code>draw_board</code> it is inconsistent to write the escape code once as <code>\x1B</code> and once as <code>\033</code>. As a benefit for the readers who don't know the color table by heart, you should explain what these color codes do:</p>

<pre><code>std::string green = "\x1B[32m";
std::string normal = "\x1B[0m";

std::cout &lt;&lt; green &lt;&lt; "○" &lt;&lt; normal &lt;&lt; "\n";
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>I don't understand the initial question "do you want to play"? — of course I want, otherwise I wouldn't have started the game at all.</p>

<hr>

<p>Why did you choose the really long variable name for the board, why not just <code>Board board</code>? As it is written now, the variable name draws too much attention.</p>

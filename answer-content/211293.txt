<p>You didn't specify if you were allowed to use <a href="/questions/tagged/ecmascript-6" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'ecmascript-6'" rel="tag">ecmascript-6</a> features or not but presumably you were, since you used <code>let</code> and arrow functions. As an interviewer, I would note that you used those features, yet you iterated over the array using a regular <code>for</code> loop instead of using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of" rel="noreferrer"><code>for...of</code></a>. That isn't necessarily a bad thing since it demonstrates that you know how to increment a counter in a standard loop and then use that for indexing into the array, but you don't have to if you use a <code>for...of</code> loop.</p>

<p>The technique for sorting the array is good, though because <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort" rel="noreferrer"><code>Array.prototype.sort()</code></a> "<em>sorts the elements of an array <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm" rel="noreferrer">in place</a> and returns the array</em>"<sup><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort" rel="noreferrer">1</a></sup> there isn't really a need to store the value in <code>newArr</code> because <code>resultArr</code> is sorted.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>let newArr = resultArr.sort((a,b)=&gt;{
    return a[0]-b[0];
});
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>You could have just returned the first two elements of <code>resultArr</code>.</p>

<p>Also, <code>const</code> could have been used for any variable that is never re-assigned - including arrays that merely have elements pushed into them - to avoid accidental re-assignment. </p>

<p>PDO has a great feature for you, <a href="https://phpdelusions.net/pdo#prepared" rel="nofollow noreferrer">it can accept an array with parameters for <code>execute()</code></a>. It means you won't have to extract separate variables anymore.</p>

<p>So just use PDO instead of mysqli and your code will become just two lines</p>

<pre><code>$CRM_GET = $CRM-&gt;filter("IsSupplier eq true");
$stmt = "INSERT IGNORE INTO data_exact_crm (ID, Code, SearchCode, Name, AddressLine1, AddressLine2, AddressLine3, VATNumber, CountryDescription, City, PostCode, StateDescription, Remarks)
   VALUES (:ID,:Code, :SearchCode,:Name,:AddressLine1,:Addressline2,:Addressline3,:VatNumber,:Country,:City,:Postcode,:State,:Remarks)";
foreach($CRM_GET as $CRM) {
    $stmt-&gt;execute((array)$CRM);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that I am using quite a few tricks here:</p>

<ul>
<li>an object is converted to an array for PDO</li>
<li>prepare is called only once which makes your queries executed faster (you can read on that from my article I linked above)</li>
<li>assuming ID is a primary key, there is no need to run a select query. Just add a keyword IGNORE to the INSERT statement</li>
<li>your error handling code is overkill. if you leave an exception alone, <strong>it will tell you exactly the same information you are echoing manually</strong>. So get rid of try/catch as well</li>
<li>of course such output as Worked! or Try again after each query execution is not informative ans should be removed as well</li>
</ul>

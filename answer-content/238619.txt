<p>I'd like to extend on Toby's excellent post.</p>

<p>You shouldn't be using/needing a stop gap mechanism like this.</p>

<p>Data you are working with should never be HTML-encoded and there should never be any need  for you to encoding it yourself with <code>HtmlEncode</code>. Any and all HTML-encoding should happen as late as possible, namely automatically in the template engine used (I believe in C# by default this would be in the Razor templates).</p>

<p>If you do have data that is already HTML-encoded make sure to keep it separate from any other data and use the "raw html" function of the template engine to output it. However you need to KNOW (do NOT assume!) that that HTML doesn't contain any malicious code.</p>

<p>If you have data (for example from a third party) of which you do not know if it HTML-encoded or not, then you preferable should assume it is not encoded and let it be HTML-encoded by the template engine when it is output, even if that results in double encoded HTML. Also you need to make sure that everyone involved (the third party, your boss, etc.) knows that this is a dangerous situation, that needs to be addressed.</p>

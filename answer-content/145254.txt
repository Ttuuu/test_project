<p>This part has two smells:  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Visibility of <code>baseCharge</code>: properties of a class should have least possible visibility. In your case there is no need to raise the visibility since there is a getter for it in this class already.</p></li>
<li><p>You use 2 different techniques to set the property values. This is called an <em>odd ball solution</em>. You'd better passed <em>both</em> values as constructor parameters:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class CarType {
    private int baseCharge;
    private Meter meter;
    public CarType(Meter meter, int baseCharge) {
        this.meter = meter;
        this.baseCharge = baseCharge;
    }
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

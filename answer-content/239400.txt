<p>Let's start with readability. Without deducing from functionality, I have no idea what variables like <code>s</code> and <code>ap</code>, or what functions like <code>create_s()</code> and <code>s_move()</code> do. Use clear and obvious names; the common saying is that you would read a piece of code way more often than it is written, and it thus needs to be easy to understand---you might be surprised how little even your own code will make sense to you only days after having written it.</p>

<p>You should also take care in how you set up lines, and sometimes more cases are worth it simply since they make it easier to follow what's happening. Your function here:</p>

<pre><code>if (c.coords(s[len(s)-1])[0]+directions[which_direction][0]&gt;=600 or \
   c.coords(s[len(s)-1])[1]+directions[which_direction][1]&gt;=600 or \
   c.coords(s[len(s)-1])[0]+directions[which_direction][0]&lt;=-30 or \
   c.coords(s[len(s)-1])[1]+directions[which_direction][1]&lt;=-30) and run:
</code></pre>

<p>takes a bit of effort to decipher.</p>

<p>You also shouldn't use the same variable for different things, like this:</p>

<pre><code>def create_s():
    for x in range(3):
        create_s_square(x=300,y=300)
</code></pre>

<p>where the <code>x</code> in your for loop has nothing to do with the square dimensions. Usually people would write <code>for _ in range(3):</code> here to show that we don't actually care about the index of the iterator.</p>

<p>I think you should start looking at OOP pretty soon, but before that a glaring issue is that your functions all rely entirely on "side-effects"; they don't accept any arguments and they return nothing. You should stop using global variables and instead pass whatever variables you need between your functions. Global variables are almost always a bad idea.</p>

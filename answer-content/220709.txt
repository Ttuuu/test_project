<p>You should not instanciate a new DbContext each time your code go throw your ActionFilter. <br> What you should do is to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><strong>dependency injection</strong></a> and to define an execution scope.
<br><br>
Because you are using .net Framework and not .net core, I advise you to look into DI providers such as <a href="https://autofac.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Autofac</a> or <a href="https://autofaccn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lifetime/instance-scope.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Ninject</a>.
<br><br>
I advise you to look into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection#Advantages" rel="nofollow noreferrer">why to use DI</a> and think about what execution scope you need (probably <code>perScope()</code> in your case).</p>

<p>Hope it helps.</p>

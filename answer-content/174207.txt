<p>You can try <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/segmented-sieve/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">segmented sieve</a> if you want to have a faster way of generating primes. Also You can try using scanf/printf instead of cin/cout <em>ios_base ::sync_with_stdio(false)</em> with cin/cout , but it won't matter here i guess , as your input and output is small. But still you can try.</p>

<p>Also you should change that <code>n/i</code> to <code>j*i</code> , its not a good practice.</p>

<pre><code>    while is_debilitated:
        mobility = 0
</code></pre>

<p>I'm guessing you were hoping that this would set mobility to zero whenever is_debilitated was true? (All that can do is either nothing at all or create an infinite loop.)</p>

<p>I'd suggest something like</p>

<pre><code>def get_mobility(self):
        if self.is_debilitated:
            return 0
        else:
            return self.mobility
</code></pre>

<p>And any other effects that temporarily modify mobility could go there.
Then elsewhere you'd put</p>

<pre><code>if defense &gt;= defender.get_mobility():
</code></pre>

<p>in place of</p>

<pre><code>if defense &gt;= defender.mobility:
</code></pre>

<p>(Apologies if I got any of the Python grammar wrong - I'm more of a C++ guy...)</p>

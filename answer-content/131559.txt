<p>Those waits will kill you. A second doesn't seem like much, until you stack a lot of them together. I don't think you need to set CutCopyMode to False until the very end, either.</p>

<p>What I would try is something like the following. Instead of this, which has two built-in wait periods:</p>

<pre><code>rngTemp.Select
Application.Wait (Now + TimeValue("0:00:01"))
Selection.Copy
DoEvents
Application.Wait (Now + TimeValue("0:00:01"))
WdObj.Selection.PasteSpecial
</code></pre>

<p>I would use a loop to repeat the attempted paste until it has no error, something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Do
    On Error Resume Next
    rngTemp.Copy
    DoEvents
    WdObj.Selection.PasteSpecial
    If Err.Number = 0 Then
        On Error Goto 0
        Exit Do
    End If
Loop
</code></pre>

<p>In fact, it seems to me that there isn't so much a problem with the copy as with the paste, so try this first:</p>

<pre><code>rngTemp.Copy
DoEvents
Do
    On Error Resume Next
    WdObj.Selection.PasteSpecial
    If Err.Number = 0 Then
        On Error Goto 0
        Exit Do
    End If
Loop
</code></pre>
    </div>

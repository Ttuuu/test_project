<pre><code>def send_mail() :

<p>Per PEP8, you wouldn't typically include a space before those colons. You should run your code through a linter.</p>

<pre><code>password = input("Password :")
</code></pre>

<p>This is a big no-no. Never expose a user's password content on the screen if you can avoid it. Instead, use the built-in <code>getpass</code> which attempts to mask your input.</p>

<pre><code>mail.close()
</code></pre>

<p>You should avoid doing this explicitly, and instead use <code>mail</code> in a <code>with</code> statement.</p>

<pre><code>'3 attempts before locking you out for 10 seconds.'
</code></pre>

<p>This line has no effect. Perhaps you meant to write <code>print</code> here. Also, don't hard-code the <code>3</code> in the string; use <code>num_of_tries</code>.</p>

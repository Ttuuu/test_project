<p>I don't have time to really look at the code well or do a full review, but what did stick out to me was the repeated calls to <code>arr.index(i)</code>. That's an expensive call that will require, in the worst case, a full iteration of <code>arr</code> <em>each time</em>.</p>

<p>At the very least, that call should be done once then cached. Really though, that information is already available to you without searching if you use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="noreferrer"><code>enumerate</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>def minimum_swaps(arr):
    count = 0
    correct = [(x+1) for x in range(len(arr))]
    while arr != correct:
        for i, x in enumerate(arr):  # I changed what was i to x, then made i the index
            if x != i+1:
                a = x
                b = arr[x-1]
                arr[x-1] = a
                arr[i] = b
                count += 1
                break

    return count
</code></pre>

<p>I also renamed some variables. <code>i</code> is an awful name for an element that <em>isn't</em> itself an index, and the function name should be in snake_case instead.</p>

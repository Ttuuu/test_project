<p>The AI needs some random loss of concentration. The <code>AIPaddle.update</code> method needs to start pretending that <code>self.speed</code> is zero and continue to do so for a while (about a second).</p>

<p>To the player it will appear that the game will lose concentration every now and then and give the human player a chance to score.  You could also try to make the AI look at a previous position of the ball to cause some human-like decision making lag, but I doubt it's worth it.</p>

<p>An alternative approach would be to simply increase the speed of the ball but not the paddles.  The AI looks defensive, so it might not be able to score, and increasing the speed of the ball would give the human player a chance to score more often by intentionally positioning the paddle in advantageous ways.</p>

<p>This is what I would do differently</p>

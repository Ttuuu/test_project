<p>Code is generally very clean, although I do have a number of reservations with some of the naming: <code>c</code> prefix for class modules, <code>M</code> for standard ones, is pure noise; <code>Cell</code> as a suffix for something that isn't a <em>cell</em>, is confusing. That kind of thing.</p>

<p>I would have named <code>cStyles</code> as <code>Styles</code>, or perhaps <code>StyleProcessor</code> since we don't want to hide <code>Excel.Styles</code>; anything that makes it sound like it's more than just a custom collection of styles would probably be a good name. <code>MStyles</code> is confusing - I'd just call it <code>Macros</code>, since all it contains is, well, macros (/entry-point procedures), and too many things are "styles" here.</p>

<p>The internal <code>Private Type</code> isn't being useful here. If there was a <code>Styles</code> property, it would be. But there isn't, so it's not helping with any name-clashing properties/private fields.</p>

<p>The <code>cStyle</code> class, I'd probably name it <code>StyleConfig</code>, or <code>StyleInfo</code> - plain <code>Style</code> would be hiding <code>Excel.Style</code>, and we would rather avoid doing that. If we go with <code>StyleInfo</code>, then <code>infos</code> makes a reasonably sensible name for it:</p>

<pre><code>Private infos As Collection
</code></pre>

<p>A <em>Factory Pattern</em> doesn't directly make code easier to maintain. In fact it could be argued that it makes things more complicated! <a href="http://rubberduckvba.wordpress.com/?p=7256" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Dependency Injection in VBA</a> explains where and why you would want to use a <em>factory pattern</em>: it's a tool to help reduce <em>coupling</em>. In itself, a factory method is little more than an <code>Init</code> method that, instead of initializing the current instance, creates, initializes, and returns a new one - effectively allowing parameterized initialization of objects, like constructors do in other languages.</p>

<p>Having a <em>factory method</em> on <code>cStyle</code> (with a default instance / predeclared ID) would remove the need to have an <code>Init</code> method, so you could do this:</p>

<pre><code>this.Styles.Add cStyle.Create(...)
</code></pre>

<p>A <em>factory method</em> can't really hurt, but a <em>factory pattern</em> would indeed be overkill: you don't need to decouple <code>cStyle</code> from <code>cStyles</code>, the two classes are <em>tightly coupled</em>, but unless you're looking to decouple the <code>Excel.Style</code> dependency, there's little to gain here IMO.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Question: How can I structure this classes to add more Actions based on Composition?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You'd have to extract an <code>IAction</code> (or <code>IStyleAction</code>) class/interface, and implement it with some <code>DeleteStyleAction</code>, <code>DuplicateStyleAction</code>, and <code>ReplaceStyleAction</code> classes, and then <code>ProcessStyles</code> (I'd trim it to just <code>Process</code>) starts looking very much like a <em>strategy pattern</em>:</p>

<pre><code>Public Sub Process()
    Dim info As StyleInfo
    For Each info In infos
        Dim strategy As IStyleAction
        Set strategy = styleActions(info.Action)
        strategy.Run
    Next
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>IStyleAction</code> is a class/interface stub exposing a simple <code>Run</code> method, and <code>styleActions</code> could be a simple keyed collection:</p>

<pre><code>Private Sub Class_Initialize()
    Set infos = New Collection
    Set styleActions = New Collection
    styleActions.Add New DeleteStyleAction, "Delete"
    styleActions.Add New DuplicateStyleAction, "Duplicate"
    styleActions.Add New ReplaceStyleAction, "Replace"
    '...
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how every single one of these <code>New</code> statements increases the number of classes that are <em>coupled</em> with this <code>StyleProcessor</code> (<code>cStyles</code>) class? That's because the <code>StyleProcessor</code> is responsible for knowing what actions are available and what string value refers to what action - if we removed that responsibility, we would also remove that coupling. We can remove responsibilities from a class by <em>injecting</em> components instead of <code>New</code>ing them up. See <a href="https://rubberduckvba.wordpress.com/2019/09/19/dependency-injection-in-vba/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Dependency Injection in VBA</a> if that's something you want to explore.</p>

<p>Other observations, in no particular order:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>cStyle.Init</code> needs explicit declared types for the parameters, and <code>ByVal</code> modifiers.</li>
<li>Lots of parameters are implicitly passed <code>ByRef</code>, some are implicitly passed <code>ByVal</code>. Consistency! You want everything passed <code>ByVal</code> unless the compiler says otherwise, or unless you're using <code>ByRef</code> to return values to the caller.</li>
<li><code>Public Property Set Style(ByRef Style As Style)</code> is a lie. <code>Property Set</code> and <code>Property Let</code> procedures always receive their value argument <code>ByVal</code>: the modifier is not only not needed, it's outright lying. And since the default/implicit modifier is <code>ByRef</code> anyway, I'm worried this one was added "because it's an object and so it must be passed by reference" (not true), which denotes a misunderstanding of how <code>ByRef</code>/<code>ByVal</code> work.</li>
<li>Vertical whitespace in <code>Duplicate</code> is distracting.</li>
<li><code>cStyles.Item</code> wants a <code>@DefaultMember</code> annotation (/<code>VB_UserMemId = 0</code> attribute).</li>
<li>The <code>LoadStyles</code> and <code>ProcessStyles</code> macros don't need a local variable; just go <code>With New cStyles</code> and perform the member calls against the <code>With</code> block variable.</li>
<li>Both <code>LoadStyles</code> and <code>ProcessStyles</code> are implicitly <code>Public</code>.</li>
<li>Not sure <code>Clear</code> has any business being exposed; feels like YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It).</li>
</ul>

<p>Rubberduck inspections should be warning you about the implicit modifiers and unused members.</p>

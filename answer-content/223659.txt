<p>Your robot creator is not a factory in the traditional sense, because it never returns the robots it creates, or exposes them publicly. Generally, a factory object would do the same job as a class constructor, with the advantage of being a first-class object that can be passed around, stored in a field somewhere, and so on (without resorting to reflection or other "magic," in languages that support that).</p>

<p>This looks more like a strategy pattern, where it decides what type of robot to use internally, based on a parameter supplied by the client at runtime.</p>

<p>It's difficult to propose an alternate solution, because it's not clear exactly what problem this code attempts to solve.</p>

<p>In addition to the other good advice in the other answers, I would add:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do not catch any exception that you could have prevented. Instead, prevent the exception.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is never any reason to catch <code>ArgumentException</code> because it should never be thrown in the first place. <em>You</em> are responsible for ensuring that when you pass arguments to a method, that those arguments meet the requirements of the method you're calling. You know if the string you're going to pass is null or empty; if it is, <em>don't pass it</em>. </p>

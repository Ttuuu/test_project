<p>I'm not entirely sure I understand what this does, but here goes.</p>

<ul>
<li>Mojolicious doesn't use Moose. I would think long and hard whether I'd extend a <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Mojo::Base" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Mojo::Base</a> class with Moose. Does this work properly?</li>
<li>There are several instances of <code>required</code> together with <code>default</code> and <code>lazy</code> in your new attributes. Those do not make sense together. If it's <code>required</code> it needs to be passed in at construction. There is no need to make it <code>lazy</code> then as it will always be there from the start.</li>
<li>Your <code>default</code> for both <code>reject_filter</code> as well as <code>resolve_filter</code> are subs that return <code>undef</code> implicitly. That means if you don't pass those in, everything is discarded. Is that the intended behavior?</li>
<li><strike>Your class is a subclass of <code>Mojo::Promise</code>, so there is no need to call <code>Mojo::Promise-&gt;all</code>. It's got an inherited <code>-&gt;all</code> method that you can call on <code>$self</code>.</strike> (<code>Mojo::Promise-&gt;all</code>) returns a new object, so this breaks.</li>
</ul>

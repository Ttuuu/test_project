<p>Congratulations on taking class inheritance with a pinch of salt. This is a tricky part of OOP due to the strong dependency created between the parent and child classes and yet out of an urge for classification many people apply it badly, myself included.</p>

<p>As I understand, you have Blackjack players and one of them is the Dealer. So I would have this simple specialization: <code>BlackjackDealer extends BlackjackPlayer</code>. None of them would be abstract, so sorry if you wanted to put abstract classes to use.</p>

<p>You employ abstract classes when you want to provide partial functionality in a class but it seems that you don't have any to belong to the parent class. This is why I recommend the previous simpler design.</p>

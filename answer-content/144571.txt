<p>Here are my comments:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The class is called <code>AutoTellerMachine</code>, but the comment says that it represents a customer who uses the teller machine: this is a bit confusing. If your ATM supports only one operation at a time, then the class name is correct, and the comment is misleading. If it supports multiple concurrent operations, then the name is incorrect.</p></li>
<li><p>The interface mixes ATM operations and account info. For example, <code>GetAccountBalance</code>, <code>accountBalance</code> etc. would have a better home in a class called <code>Account</code> which would be aggregated by <code>AutoTellerMachine</code>. (This is not the full list of methods/data members)</p></li>
<li><p><code>int</code> does not seem the right type for <code>accountLocation</code>. If the variable was meant to be <code>accountId</code>, then the intent becomes clearer, but even then, the type should be <code>size_t</code> or <code>unsigned int</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Not sure why <code>accountLocation</code> (or <code>accountId</code>) has a getter and a setter. This exposes implementation details, and breaks encapsulation.</p></li>
<li><p>ATMs in the real world do not allow creating new accounts, so <code>CreateNewAccount</code> looks out of place.</p></li>
<li><p><code>AccountList.at(accountListSize - 1)</code> looks plain wrong - this way the vector will not automatically reallocate the right storage. Consider <code>emplace_back</code> or a similar technique.</p></li>
<li><p><code>if(successfulLogin != true)</code> is an odd pattern - why not just say <code>if (successfulLogin)</code> ? Also, why not have just <code>else</code> instead of <code>else if(successfulLogin == true)</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p>I'll stop here (duty calls elsewhere), but hopefully this gives you some useful feedback. </p>

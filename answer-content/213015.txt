<p>For one, fetchAll() is not the only method to get the result from a query with PDO. When you are expecting a single row, you should use a function for the exact purpose - fetch(). It will make your code meaningful, readable and concise:</p>

<pre><code>$row = $sth-&gt;fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
if($row) { 
    $_SESSION['user'] = $row;
    header('Location: home.php');
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also, I am not sure about security. I don't know your conditions but in the wild it is very easy to forge REMOTE_USER by requesting your site like this: <a href="http://fake_username:foo@example.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://fake_username:foo@example.com/</a></p>

<p>So at least make sure that it's indeed an existing windows user is set in REMOTE_USER all the time (depends on your conditions, server settings etc). </p>

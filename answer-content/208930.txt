<p>The code in the question was an attempt to generate type contract names, from the way I saw how MEF created them. Especially the difference from <code>Type.FullName</code>, which was previously used, when getting a contract name. For this reason, the code is a probably inferior re-implementation of MEF's own name generation, and should not be used for this purpose.</p>

<p>This is the contract name resolution used by MEF in .NET framework (maybe different namespace in Core, Apps etc.):</p>

<p>Namespace:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>System.ComponentModel.Composition
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Static method:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>AttributedModelServices.GetContractName(Type)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, it's often easier to re-invent the wheel, than to find out about existing implementations...</p>

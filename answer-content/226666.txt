<p>The code looks much simpler than I would expect for this task. I tried several examples but could neither make it fail, nor did I understand why and how this algorithm works, I was only delighted that it seems to work. Therefore I have only a few remarks.</p>

<p>The early return for <code>length &lt;= 1</code> is not necessary.</p>

<p>The <code>++rooms</code> is missing the semicolon.</p>

<p>Apart from that, it looks perfect.</p>

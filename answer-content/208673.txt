  <p>I mentioned time and space complexity as O(n).</p>

<p>Those bounds seem rather loose. If the tree is self-balancing then on a quick glance, and without attempting to prove it, I think your code probably has time complexity <span class="math-container">\$O(k + \lg n)\$</span> and space <span class="math-container">\$O(\lg n)\$</span>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My iterative version takes extra space. Is there any way to do it without any extra space?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Assuming that by "<em>without any extra space</em>" you really mean "<em>with <span class="math-container">\$O(1)\$</span> extra space</em>", it depends. Does <code>TreeNode</code> have a reference to its parent?</p>

<p>The way to really do this efficiently is for <code>TreeNode</code> to have a variable which tracks the size of the subtree rooted at that node.</p>

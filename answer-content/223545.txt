<li><p>Passing the database connection as a variable is a good technique.</p></li>
<li><p>Validate user input as much as possible before considering executing any processes.  If the input is missing or invalid, don't do anything with the submission.</p>

<pre><code>if (empty($_GET["user"])) { // add your validation here if possible
    echo "Missing/Invalid data submitted";
    // halt the script or redirect or whatever
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Use object-oriented mysqli syntax because it is more brief and IMO cleaner to read.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not perform iterated queries.  You can easily condense you iterated queries into one simple query using an INNER JOIN.  Something like this should do (untested):</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM users u
INNER JOIN posts p USING userid 
WHERE u.user_name = ?
  AND p.hostid = p.userid
  AND p.commentid = 0
</code></pre>

<p><code>USING</code> is a convenient shorthand keyword when the two joining columns are identical; otherwise use <code>ON</code> and declare the columns individually. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/11366006/2943403">MySQL ON vs USING?</a> You should also replace <code>*</code> in the SELECT clause with the exact columns you need from either table.  (Never ask for more than you need.) With the above query, you will only need to bind <code>$_GET"user"]</code> once since there is now only one placeholder.</p></li>
<li><p>I don't typically endorse printing from the same function that does the processing.  If you are going to print nested html elements, you can improve readability by tabbing them.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a cleaner way to extract the file extension than picking up post-explosion debris.  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/173876/2943403">How do I get (extract) a file extension in PHP?</a></p>

<pre><code>$ext = pathinfo($filename, PATHINFO_EXTENSION);
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>If <code>$row['fileid']</code> isn't 1 or 2, don't bother printing an empty string.</p></li>

<p>You should prepare everything (find elements, etc) you can as soon as you can (on document load, assuming the elements Are not added dynamically). Dont wait for user action.</p>

<p>Also dont load current location upon checking the checkbox. Load it upon form submit, prevent default submit action And only send to server after location Is obtained. Maybe display some load progress bar to the user meanwhile...</p>

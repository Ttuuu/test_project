<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>@coaches = Coach
             .includes(:user)
             .joins(:bookmarks)
             .where(bookmarks: { bookmarkable_type: "Coach", client: @client })
             .select("coaches.*, bookmarks.id AS bookmark_id")
</code></pre>

<p>After this query you can do the following:</p>

<pre><code>@coaches.first.id # returns coach id
@coaches.first.bookmark_id # returns the relevant bookmark_id
@coaches.first.user.name # returns the user's name of that coach.
</code></pre>

<p>This approach has one advantage over including the collection of bookmarks that it won't load the whole objects of bookmarks into memory when you need only bookmark_id.</p>

<p>Why do you use BitSet? You're not saving kilobytes of memory by representing your printers as a set of bits. Go for code clarity and represent each printer with a dedicated instance of Printer class that holds the allocation status of the printer in question. Store them in a List or other data structure that suits your needs. You could even have two LinkedLists for allocated and free printers and just pop the first from the <code>free</code> list and push it to the end of the <code>allocated</code> list. You need to synchronize anyway. No need to count sizes to see if there are available printers. Just check <code>isEmpty()</code>.</p>

<p><code>bitSet</code> is a bad name for printer reservartion status. Java is a strongly typed language so you don't need to repeat the type in the field name. Use <code>printerAllocationStatus</code> if you really need to use a BitSet (see above).</p>

<p>You're stacking on responsibilities by implementing <code>hasEnoughPrinters</code> in your allocator. Instead implement <code>getNumberOfFreePrinters</code> and let the caller decide what to do with the information. The method is of limited use anyway, since printer allocation status might change right after the caller has checked for availability making the data the caller has completely useless.</p>

<p><code>getNextPrinter</code> does not communicate the side effect of changing printer allocation status in it's name. Use <code>allocatePrinter</code> instead.</p>

<p>Use consistent terminology. In a PritnerAllocator a printer is allocated or free, not assigned.</p>

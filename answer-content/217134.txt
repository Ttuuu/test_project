<p>The code looks like it is coming from Windows Forms, I can't be certain, it could be WPF.</p>

<p>The code does not seem to be in a <code>MVVM</code> or <code>MVC</code> design pattern. Either of these design patterns would allow data abstraction from the user interface.</p>

<p>The code might be less complex and easier to maintain if there was some separation between the UI (view) and the data (Model). The code might also be less complex and easier to maintain if it was broken up into smaller functions that did only one thing (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Single Responsibility Principle</a>).</p>

<p><strong>All SQL Queries can throw errors</strong></p>

<p>The first SQL query in the file is not in a try/catch block, if the SQL query fails the program will fail.</p>

<p>The error message in the catch block "Invalid Login try checking Username Or Password !" doesn't represent what actually happened. If this catch block executes it means that the database that is being queried threw the exception and that there is an error either in the SQL code or the table doesn't exist in the database.</p>

<p><strong>Use Using Blocks</strong>  </p>

<p>A using statement provides additional error checking as well as cleaning up after the SQL call. There are some examples of using statements in this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3079098/the-c-sharp-using-statement-sql-and-sqlconnection">stackoverflow question</a>.</p>

<p>You can wrap connections and SQL commands in using statements. For an SQL connection wrapped in a using statement the database the connection will be closed automatically. An SQL command will be properly disposed of it is wrapped in a using statement.</p>

<p><strong>User Input Error Checking</strong>  </p>

<p>There doesn't seem to be any error checking on the username or password, in some cases this can allow SQL Injection attacks.</p>

<p>On more secure websites the password might be checked against a set of rules to make it more secure, such as a requirement for 2 lowercase characters, 2 uppercase characters, 2 integers, and special characters, as well as a minimum length.</p>

<p>There might also be a count of the number of times the button was pushed to prevent a bot attack.</p>

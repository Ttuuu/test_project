<p>I was asked this question in an interview and I couldn't solve it at first. Later on, I spent some hours on it and finally, I found a proper solution. You should split array from the first index or from the last index to get the maximum difference. I mean max difference is either Max(A[0,...,A.length-2])-A[A.length-1] or A[0]-Max(A[1,...,A.length-1]).
For ex, you splitted array from kth index and you have the max value of whole array on the array on left side. In order to minimize the right side array's max value, you should only get the last item cause it will be included for every cases that you split array from k+1 or k+2 (&lt; n). And vice versa is also same. So as result you should calculate these two values and select best one.</p>

<p>Using <code>sum</code> as a variable name is not adviced as it hides the <code>sum</code> builtin. I'd suggest <code>sum_pow</code> as an alternative.</p>

<p>Also, <code>temp</code> does not convey much information. I'd use <code>remaining</code> even though I am not fully convinced.</p>

<p><strong>Extracting digits from a number</strong></p>

<p>You've used divisions and modulo to compute the different digits for a number. You can use <code>divmod</code> which is a pretty unknown builtin which returns the result for both operations in one go.</p>

<p>That would give:</p>

<pre><code>   remaining = num
   while remaining:
       remaining, digit = divmod(remaining, 10)
       sum_pow += digit ** order
</code></pre>

<p>Also, a better alternative would be to avoid doing this ourselves: extracting the different digits is pretty much what <code>str</code> does for us. Also, we already call it anyway, we could make the most out of it and reuse the result.</p>

<pre><code>   num_str = str(num)
   order = len(num_str)
   sum_pow = 0
   for digit in num_str:
       sum_pow += int(digit) ** order
</code></pre>

<p><strong>More builtins</strong></p>

<p>Disclaimer: next comment may be a bit overwhelming for a beginner. Don't worry, just take your time and read documentation online if need be.</p>

<p>We've already delegated most of the hard work to Python builtins but we can go further. The summing part could be handled by the <code>sum</code> builtin along with generator expressions.</p>

<pre><code>for num in range(lower, upper + 1):
   num_str = str(num)
   order = len(num_str)
   sum_pow = sum(int(digit) ** order for digit in num_str)
   if num == sum_pow:
       print(num)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Going further</strong></p>

<p>A few other things could be improved from an organisation point of view:</p>

<ul>
<li>split the code in functions</li>
<li>use the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8228257/what-does-if-name-main-mean-in-python">if <strong>name</strong> == "<strong>main</strong>"</a> check</li>
</ul>

<p>Going even further, we could write unit tests for the logic.</p>

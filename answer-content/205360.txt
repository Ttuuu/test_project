<p>I am fairly new to Asynchronous programming in c# but I have infact programmed parallel systems using C++. From all of my experience dealing from novice to seasoned programmers, I normally try and write code in a way in which other people reading my code would understand it one shot.</p>

<p>Since .NET 4.5, async and await has provided programmers an intuitive and easy way to perform Asynchronous operations without having to deal with Synchronization context or Callbacks, the runtime does this pretty well for them.</p>

<p>Coming back to your questions :-</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it "too clever" in your opinion? I don't think there is any similar native construct that achieves this so it could be seen as clever by some I'm sure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would say cleaver but not "too clever", it is using a simple extension method to do what you would otherwise do by writing a hefty, verbose code.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do you consider this over-engineering?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not at all. It is simple and quite readable even to me even though I have been using C# for only a year.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it more readable/intuitive to you?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is to me, but some of my colleagues found this a little complicated. But trust me, it is not. Always better to reduce your code as much as possible.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do you have other suggestions for the method name?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am not seasoned enough to answer a better solution than this. </p>

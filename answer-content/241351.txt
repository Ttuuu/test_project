<p>Improvise means something different then you think :)</p>

<p><code>log10(mnorm)</code> seems to be needed to compute only once. And you can do it in your head. It is 0.</p>

<p>Same for <code>log10(mc)</code> (well not in your head this one :)).</p>

<p><code>imf_type</code> seems useless when not zero. I am not pythonist, so, what does imf() return if imf_type is nonzero?</p>

<p><code>sigma**2</code> can also be computed once.</p>

<p><code>log10(mmin)</code> and <code>log10(mmax)</code> can be computed once per <code>mass_dist</code> call.</p>

<p><code>myf.imf(x, imf_type)</code> can be computed once per call to extend (or mass_dist, im not sure what that statement means, but I am almost sure that imf call can be moved at least one level up). This one is probably the biggest performance killer. </p>

<p>And there're probably more instances of this (anti)pattern.</p>

<p>As for the algorithm itself, I leave that to others :)</p>

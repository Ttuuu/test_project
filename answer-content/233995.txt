  <p>Else-If instead of guard statements / early return</p>

<p>Where I am we do the same thing as what the maintainer is suggesting.</p>

<p>IMHO you are way over thinking it and it does not matter. The only thing that matters is <strong>consistency</strong>. You're obviously used to doing it the first way, which makes the second seem so unnatural. Don't take it personally, you get used to following the code base's style as you practice committing to different projects.</p>

<p>It's unfortunate they don't have a style guide or anything. But it doesn't mean anything goes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They even called it uncommon. Is this really true</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's probably uncommon in their code base. Either way it really doesn't matter which is more popular.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there any advantage of this I am missing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, I'd bet it compiles to the same byte code. You could check.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Return modifiable collections</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As someone whose also dealt with hard-to-find bugs relating to lists being mutable, I agree with what you said. But from the maintainers point of view, the code base should be changed entirely to follow this rule.</p>

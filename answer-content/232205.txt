<p>The very first thing to speed up a prime sieve is to ignore even numbers. This will save both half of the memory accesses, as well as half of the executable instructions.</p>

<p>So, <code>criba[j]</code> then represents whether (2*j+1) is prime, and the array accesses need to be adjusted accordingly.</p>

<p>If you desire "2" to be included in your output, just <code>cout</code> it.</p>

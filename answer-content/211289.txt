<p>You could eliminate some of the many dependencies:</p>

<ul>
<li>Since you're already using <code>@dataclass</code>, you could use it for <code>MostSleepy</code> instead of <code>namedtuple</code></li>
<li>It looks strange to <code>import statistics</code> after <code>from statistics import mode</code>. Aside from <code>mode</code>, the only other thing used from it is <code>StatisticsError</code>. So you could use <code>from statistics import mode, StatisticsError</code> and not import the entire <code>statistics</code></li>
<li>I don't see the <code>enum</code> doing anything useful. You could remove it and the program will still work.</li>
<li>The <code>operator</code> is not very useful either. You could replace <code>operator.attrgetter("time")</code> with <code>lambda t: t.time</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>add_sleeps</code> function could be written more compactly:</p>

<pre><code>def add_sleeps(self, minute):
    self.sleeps.extend(list(range(self.last_sleep, minute)))
</code></pre>

<p>When creating the <code>events</code> list,
you used helper functions <code>get_guard</code> and <code>event_type</code>.
It would have been good to do the same for the time too.</p>

<p>The <code>last_sleep</code> attribute doesn't belong in <code>GuardSleep</code>.
It's an implementation detail of the parsing of the lines,
it has no other use for a <code>GuardSleep</code> instance.</p>

<p>Instead of string concatenation like <code>"foo " + str(bar)</code>,
the recommended way is f-strings, <code>f"foo {bar}"</code>.</p>

<p>The input would have allowed some simplifications.
For example, alphabetic sorting of the lines gives the same results as sorting by time.
And, it seems all the "falls asleep" and "wakes up" events happen in the 0th hour.
As such, you could just parse the minute instead of the entire time:</p>

<pre><code>events = [Event(int(line[15:17]), get_guard(line), event_type(line)) for line in sorted(read_file(4))]
</code></pre>

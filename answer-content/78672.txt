<p>This looks like a pretty nice script to me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was thinking that maybe it should create the backup dir if it doesn't exist, but not sure if it's necessarily better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't think there's a universal answer to that,
it's your call how you want the script to behave.
It depends on your use whether you need the script to create a backup directory if it doesn't exist,
or if you want to avoid it creating directories at unintended locations.
A compromise might be to add a <code>-p</code> flag like <code>mkdir</code> has to "create parents".</p>

<p>Not that it really matters,
but I think it should be slightly more efficient,
and more natural to flip these conditions:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>    if os.stat(backup_file).st_ctime &lt; (time.time() - NO_OF_DAYS * 86400):
        if os.path.isfile(backup_file):
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>That is:</p>

<pre><code>    if os.path.isfile(backup_file):
        if os.stat(backup_file).st_ctime &lt; (time.time() - NO_OF_DAYS * 86400):
</code></pre>

<p>You seem to be following <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow">PEP8</a> for the most part,
with few exceptions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't put a space before parentheses, as in <code>print (something)</code></li>
<li>Put two empty lines in front of function definitions</li>
</ul>

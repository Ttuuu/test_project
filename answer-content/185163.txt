<p>The one performance thing I see is that you can calculate the value of </p>

<p><code>Math.sqrt(n)</code></p>

<p>outside of the loop so that it doesn't have to be calculated each time.</p>

<pre><code>double squareRoot=Math.sqrt(n)
while (i&lt;Math.sqrt(n)) {
</code></pre>

<p>I am not familiar with the sieve of Eratosthenes but if you could find a way to store only the primes and return a random one from that, it should speed your code up.</p>

<p>Perhaps I misunderstand you. But it looks as though you've already written the functions to call one another: <code>get_info()</code> calls <code>make_post()</code> internally, and <code>make_post()</code> then delegates getting the token to <code>get_token()</code> by calling it internally to itself. So in your final line of code, you should be able to replace the three calls with a single call to <code>get_info()</code>.</p>

<p>Whether or not that's "better" than calling them independently is a question of style. Personally, I think it's best to keep the functions independent and call them separately. This would mean re-writing them to take parameters that are the results of the preceding function call.</p>

<p>This way the functions don't have to know about each other's existence, and means you will be able to change each one independently over time as requirements evolve, without needing to update the others (this is called <em>low coupling</em>, a very useful design quality to keep in mind).</p>

<p>You're calling <code>now()</code> twice - what will happen if the month changes between those two calls?  </p>

<p>Your code skips all files that exist, even though your linked question indicates that you need to update changed files. </p>

<p>Your code checks that file is non-empty, but rsync is already doing this for you with <code>--min-size=1</code>.</p>

<p>More generally, before you code up file-sync logic, it's best to read the rsync man page and see if your problem is already solved.   Syncing files is a task full of corner cases and gotchas; life is too short for you to find them all.  Just let rsync take care of it, whenever possible.</p>

<p>The code below will update changed files while skipping unchanged files (as in your problem description).  If you want to copy only new, non-existing files (as in your posted code), add <code>--ignore-existing</code> to the rsync options.</p>

<pre><code>import datetime
import subprocess

def Copy_Logs():
    Sourcedir = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("/data1/logs/%B/%b_%d_%y/")
    Destdir = "/data2/logs/"
    subprocess.call(['rsync', '-avz', '--min-size=1', '--include=*.txt', '--exclude=*', Sourcedir, Destdir ])
</code></pre>

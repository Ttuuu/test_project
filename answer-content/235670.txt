<p>You shouldn't store the cancellationToken.  If someone was to call AcceptTcpClientAsync twice it would overwrite it.  Also it starts making your async call keep state and that's not something you want to do or even need to do in this case.</p>

<p>Also need to wrap the Register into a using statement such as</p>

<pre><code>// Register a Callback to be executed when the token is Cancelled.
using (cancellationToken.Register(CancellationCallback))
{
    try
    {
       return await AcceptTcpClientAsync();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>From quick search it seems this is the "<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/19220957">standard</a>" way people are handing this.</p>

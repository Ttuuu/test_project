<li><p>It's best not to use <code>using namespace std</code>.  Read <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1452721/why-is-using-namespace-std-considered-bad-practice">here</a> for more information.</p></li>
<li><p>Initialize all of your variables on separate lines.  When I tried to run your program, it crashed because one of your variables wasn't properly initialized.</p></li>
<li><p><code>input_array</code> sounds a bit odd, considering you're not even using an array.  Since it's meant to hold inputs, just call it "inputs" or something similar.</p></li>
<li><p>This entire program is created in <code>main()</code>, and that makes it very unreadable.  Instead, consider splitting it into separate functions.  <code>Main()</code> should just handle things such as initializations, user input, and displaying messages.  For now, though, I'll just focus on what you have in <code>main()</code> since it needs some work.</p></li>
<li><p>You don't need that first <code>if</code> statement since your following code blocks will handle that.</p></li>
<li><p>Your if-blocks look very unreadable, especially with the assignments separated by commas.  Consider this style for "m":</p>

<pre><code>if (unit == "m") {  
    input_array.push_back(num);

    if (count == 0) {
        low = num;
        low_unit = unit;
        high = num;
        high_unit = unit;
    }
    if (num &lt; low) {
        low = num;
        low_unit = unit;
    }
    else if (num &gt; high) {
        high = num;
        high_unit = unit;
    }

    count++;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm sure it can get simpler than that, but this does show how to separate statements and group them within curly-braces.</p></li>

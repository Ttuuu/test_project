<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>In short methods like this one:</p>

<pre><code>private Image loadImage(string location)
{
    object o = Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(location);
    return (Image) o;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I would just do this:</p>

<pre><code>private Image loadImage(string location)
{
    return (Image)Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(location);
}
</code></pre>

<p>But it looks like you are only calling this method once, so there is really no need to have a separate method for this.</p>

<p>You should probably also implement the <code>RevealLetter</code> method.
I also noticed that there is no logic for showing a hidden word to the user (like how many letter are in the word to guess. Is that intentional? it might be nice to have that for the user.</p>

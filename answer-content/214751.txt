<p>Adding to the review of <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/214741/40063">Benjamin Kuykendall</a>, pay attention especially to const correctness to protect from unintended errors and to possible allow the compiler to optimize better.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For <code>winDetection</code>, pass the board by const-ref. I see you didn't do this for <code>CheckTicTacToeBoard</code> because the function modifies the input by converting to lowercase.</p></li>
<li><p>In <code>CheckTicTacToeBoard</code>, make <code>numberOfO</code> and <code>numberOfX</code> const. Similarly, make <code>xWon</code> and <code>oWon</code> const.</p></li>
<li><p>In <code>winDetection</code>, since we are writing C++ and not C, there is no reason to declare variables at the beginning of the scope of the function unless they are not needed. In particular, <code>rightDiagWin</code> and <code>leftDiagWin</code> should be declared just before returning, and you can also make both of them const as well.</p></li>
<li><p>In e.g., your for-loop, you use preincrement for the loop variable <code>i</code>, but inside the loop you do postincrement as <code>rowIndex++</code>. Prefer to always use the preincrement since it is not returning a copy of the variable (though I believe this should always be optimized away by the compiler if it's not needed, but it doesn't hurt to be safe).</p></li>
</ul>

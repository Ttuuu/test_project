<p>It seems like your code is intended to count how many times 1 needs to be doubled (<code>1 &lt;&lt; a</code>) to reach the provided value, <code>n</code>. The code works, but the style is convoluted. Noctis Skytower provided a more straight-forward solution. Since the program expects positive integers, the end condition occurs when number is 0. For every iteration in which number is positive, accumulator is incremented by 1, and number is nearly cut in half (<code>number &gt;&gt; 1</code>). Notice that the number of right bit shifts required to set number to 0 is equivalent to the number of bits of the original number.    </p>

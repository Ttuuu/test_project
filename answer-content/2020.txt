<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>I personally find "bind('event') and trigger('event') to be cleaner and they are supposed to act faster, since that's what is done behinde the curtains anyway.</p>

<p>So it'd be:</p>

<pre><code>$('.footnote[id^="ret_"]')
  .bind('mouseenter', function(e) {
    // code
  })
  .bind('mouseleave', function(e) {
    // code 
  });
</code></pre>

<p>I'd also recommend not to use $ as a prefix for the jQuery objects - <a href="http://www.bennadel.com/blog/1778-Using-Variable-In-jQuery-Code-Is-Just-Hungarian-Notation.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bennadel.com/blog/1778-Using-Variable-In-jQuery-Code-Is-Just-Hungarian-Notation.htm</a>. I agree with what's written in that blog post – you don't prefix arrays with arr_, booleans with is_, numbers with "num_" etc. And if you do – you probably shouldn't :-)</p>

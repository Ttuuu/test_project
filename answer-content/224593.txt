<p>If I were to compute the answer, I'd do (language shown is C#):</p>

<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>var n = 1e8;
int v = n / 3;
</code></pre>

<p>6 has two multiples of three less than or equal to it: <code>6 / 3 == 2</code>
127 has 42: <code>127 / 3 == 42.3333</code>, thus <code>Math.floor(127 / 3) == 42</code>.</p>

<p>Likewise, <code>3 * n</code> will have <code>n</code> multiples of three, including three itself.</p>

<hr>

<p>Rather than having to iterate <code>1e8 - 2</code> times in a for-loop (similar amounts are often used for benchmarking tests), we just have to boil it down to a single integer division.</p>

<p>A few things I noticed:</p>

<p>Instead of adding one to the <code>Face</code> enum value, it would make sense to me to make <code>Ace = 1,</code>.  This will automatically set all the rest to where you need them.</p>

<p>A <code>Hand</code> class would make sense.  This could handle the sum of the cards as well keep track of which is hidden and which is revealed.  This removes some redundancy between the player's hand and the dealers hand</p>

<p>I would suggest taking the decision of hard or soft sum away from <code>Card</code> and put it in <code>Hand</code>.  The value of the Ace will be hard or soft depending on the other cards in the hand.</p>

<p>A <code>Game</code> to handle the play of the game would improve your design, as well as reduce the refactoring that would be needed to extend this to a GUI version.</p>

<p>I noticed you're printing various messages out in different colors.  A separate <code>Message</code> class with properties to control the attributes of each message, would help.  The messages could then be stored in a <code>Dictionary&lt;String,Message&gt;</code></p>

<p>Instead of hard coding Console printing, change your methods to accept streams and pass those as arguments in the constructor of the game.  Now you can interface with a console, network , or GUI.</p>

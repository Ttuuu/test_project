<p>In reality, people just use third-party services for that. For instance, uptime website monitoring can be done <a href="https://www.statuscake.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">StatusCake</a>. If you own the target site, you install infrastructure tools like <a href="https://newrelic.com/products/infrastructure" rel="nofollow noreferrer">New Relic</a>. Cloud services these days also provide uptime data and tools out of the box.</p>

<p>The only reason I would write my own uptime monitor is if  you're doing this for a small project or doing it for fun.</p>

<p>Now the problem with the uptime monitor you wrote is that it contributes to the site traffic. To the website, you're just another client trying to connect to the site. Together with your traffic are other sources of traffic, like legitimate users, web crawlers, malicious site scanners, DDOS bots, etc.</p>

<p>The reason you get the Request Timeout (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#5xx_Server_errors" rel="nofollow noreferrer">HTTP 504</a>) is because the site is already overloaded. It can be worse though. The site may choose to ignore you, block you temporarily, or even permanently. If you've seen a captcha appear when doing a Google search, that's one example.</p>

<p>So, what I recommend is to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reduce the rate you ping. Every 5, 15, or 60 minutes is reasonable. You're probably not going to need it every 6 seconds.</li>
<li>Hit a static asset on the domain instead, like the favicon. Hitting actual pages will cause 504s since it requires logic and probably database calls to generate the page. Just make sure it's not cached or served from a CDN. 

<ul>
<li>This only tells you if the static server/caching proxy is up, not the actual server with the logic.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If the website has an API for uptime or a status page that you can scrape, use that instead. Those are usually served by a separate server so they can still tell you the status even if the main site is down.</li>
<li>If you own the website, monitor the infrastructure instead.</li>
</ul>

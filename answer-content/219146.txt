<p>You are right to want to avoid creating the nested structure to begin with. I imagine you read my answer in the question you linked (the second one). As there, here the solution is to use <code>mapcat</code> instead of <code>map</code>. And as I also say in the comments there, while <code>mapcat-indexed</code> does not exist, you can just pass an extra <code>(range)</code> argument to get numbering.</p>

<pre><code>(defn visible-nodes [tree]
  (mapcat (fn [idx ele]
            (map #(cons idx %)
                 (cons []
                       (when (:expanded ele)
                         (visible-nodes (:children ele))))))
          (range), tree))
</code></pre>
    </div>

<h2>Feedback</h2>

<p>I know it has been nearly 3 years since this was posted and you likely have learned more about javascript and jQuery since then. Perhaps the information below is old news but nevertheless...</p>

<p>I like the styles and the sound that plays when the timer is done is fun! I did notice that if I decrease the Session Length to <code>0</code> and click the start button, it shows <code>-01:59</code> and then appears to jump up to <code>05:58</code>. Perhaps it would be wise to not allow the user to click the start button if the value for session length is 0. </p>

<h2>Recommendations</h2>

<p>I only see a couple things I would change:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It is recommended that DOM elements be stored in a variable - e.g.  </p>

<pre><code>var breakElement = $('#break');
</code></pre>

<p>And then later on use <code>breakElement</code> instead of <code>$('#break')</code> - e.g.</p>

<pre><code>breakElement.html(setBreakMinutes);
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The <code>switch</code> statement at the end seems a bit heavy - why not just use an <code>if</code>/<code>else</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>switch (runState) {
        case false:
            $('#status').html('reset');
            countDown();
            runState = true;
            break;
        case true:
            $('#status').html('start');
            stopCountDown();
            runState = false;
            break;
    }
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>While it is only few lines shorter, there is no need to remember the <code>break</code> statements: </p>

<pre><code>if (runState) {
    $('#status').html('start');
    stopCountDown();
    runState = false;
}
else {
    $('#status').html('reset');
    countDown();
    runState = true;
}
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
    </div>

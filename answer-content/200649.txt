<p>Firstly some tips:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your code uses a mixture of snake_case and camelCase, you should stick to a specific style. If you're going to write python, PEP8 states snake_case should be used as the expected style.</li>
<li>Your code lacks a <code>if __name__ == "__main__":</code> starting section. It's recommended to have this. As an example, if you don't have this, when you use tools like Sphinx to produce code documentation, it will actually run your code instead of just building the objects. Also, it's kind of expected :-)</li>
</ul>

<p>As to the core questions you have, you can use <code>pathlib</code>'s <code>Path</code> object to assist with the globbing of files and matching file parameters, as well as the string formatting <code>format</code> function to replace "placeholders" with a certain value. For instance:</p>

<pre><code>from pathlib import Path


def get_path_list(directory, base_filename_list, saved_as_of):
    for template in base_filename_list:
        file_date = template.format(saved_as_of)
        print(f"looking for {file_date}")
        files = Path(directory).glob(file_date)
        for file in files:
            print(str(file))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    today = "2018-07-25"
    files_market = ['apples_{}.xml', 'peaches_{}.xml', 'cucumbers_{}.xml', 'potatoes_{}.xml', 'tomatoes.{}.csv']
    get_path_list(".", files_market, today)
</code></pre>

<p>The code above will get you 90% of the way there, but I'll leave that as an exercise for you to complete.</p>

<p>Good Luck!</p>

<p>A few points:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You can simplify the <code>if</code> loop by using the <code>else</code> condition.</p></li>
<li><p>Getting input should be at the beginning of the <code>while</code> loop, because it makes more logical sense to put it there. It's what happens every time you restart.</p></li>
<li><p>You can use the simple condition of <code>True</code> for your while loop.</p></li>
<li><p>You don't need the <code>continue</code> keyword, as it is at the end of your loop.</p></li>
</ul>

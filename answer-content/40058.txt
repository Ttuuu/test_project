<p>Reusing the same context could have some benefits if you need entities to be cached but you could also end up with contexts with a large memory sizes.</p>

<p>Depending on the requirements, I have usually created a new context on every call and in the case of database contexts, played it safe by forcing a <code>ToList()</code> within the function, before returning the entities. </p>

<p>This ensures that the database connection is only open for just enough time to retrieve the rows and the context is destroyed without holding on to the entities retrieved.</p>

<p>The approach to take here, really depends on your requirements.</p>

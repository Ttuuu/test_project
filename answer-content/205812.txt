  <p>I have a task in which I want to handle error occurred in FTP downloading, For which I used wget command to download a file from FTP and once the download is complete, compare downloaded filesize with FTP file size.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your attempt is approach to solve this problem, and it's not a very good one.</p>

<p>The <code>wget</code> command exits with failure if the download isn't complete.
So one better, but still naive option is to check the exit code of <code>wget</code>, and use the <code>-c</code> flag to continue downloading a partially downloaded file, for example:</p>

<pre><code>while ! wget -c ...; do
     echo "Download failed, trying again..."
done
</code></pre>

<p>The issue you describe is quite common, and <code>wget</code> itself has more options to help.
For example you can specify with the <code>-t</code> flag the number of times <code>wget</code> should re-try downloading a file until it succeeds. </p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>   -t number
   --tries=number
       Set number of tries to number. Specify 0 or inf for infinite
       retrying.  The default is to retry 20 times, with the exception
       of fatal errors like "connection refused" or "not found" (404),
       which are not retried.
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Other related options may also be interesting, for example <code>--waitretry</code> (in <code>man wget</code>).</p>

<hr>

<p>Do not use <code>`...`</code>, it's obsolete. Use <code>$(...)</code> instead.</p>

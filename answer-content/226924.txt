<p>Your class does not implement any of Java collection interfaces. the solution is meant to be an implementation of a linked list that can be used as drop-in replacement for any java list/collection (and also queue). if you look at the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/LinkedList.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>LinkedList</code></a> from the jdk, you will see just what functionality you are missing. (for example, iterator, subList)</p>

<p>now I see that the class does not even implement the most basic contract from <code>Object</code> (namely, <code>equals()</code> and <code>hashCode()</code>) so you cannot safely compare two lists or put one in hash map....</p>

<p>First: you shouldn't use recursion to loop like that. It often ends up confusing and can technically lead to errors like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26158/how-does-a-stack-overflow-occur-and-how-do-you-prevent-it">stack overflows</a> if it goes on forever. If you need to loop, use a for loop or a while loop.</p>

<p>Most of the code looks like it can be in main, I don't see a reason why start has to exist. Confirmation being separate is fine.</p>

<p>You don't need to write out a try catch block for your age parsing. All the basic types in .NET have handy TryParse methods.</p>

<pre><code>if (!int.TryParse(Console.ReadLine(), out int age))
{
    /// ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>You put a useless return false at the end of your confirmation code. As for the rest, there's a lot of ways we can handle a bunch of cases for your confirmation inputs cleanly. I think a switch is good in this case. A dictionary would also work.</p>

<p><em>You could also just make the string lowercase then just check to see if the first character is y or n in your case, but we're just applying general practices.</em></p>

<pre><code>string input = Console.ReadLine();

switch (input.ToLower()) // lowercase so it works
{
    case "yes":
    case "y":
        return true;

    case "no":
    case "n":
        return false;

    default:
        // bad input code
        return false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You repeated Environment.Exit 3 times. Making the legal driving age a constant is a good idea. Just think, we could change it work for other countries!</p>

<p>If the age isn't hardcoded, instead of checking for 17 or 18 you just check to see how many years they have left until they can drive.</p>

<pre><code>const int LEGAL_DRIVING_AGE = 18; // declared somewhere, like the main class

int yearsLeft = LEGAL_DRIVING_AGE - age;

if (yearsLeft &lt;= 0)
    Console.WriteLine("You can drive!");

else if (yearsLeft == 1)
    Console.WriteLine("You can get a learners permit...");

else
    Console.WriteLine($"You're not old enough yet. You still have {yearsLeft} years to go!");

Environment.Exit(0);
</code></pre>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>

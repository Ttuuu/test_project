<p>This answer is less about the code you have produced, but more about how you could approach the problem if you were to do it again.</p>
<p>note, the python style guides promote <code>snake_case</code> over <code>camelCase</code> naming conventions, so I'll use these here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Say you have a list value like this: spam = ['apples', 'bananas', 'tofu', 'cats']</p>
<p>Write a function that takes a list value as an argument and returns a string with all the items separated by a comma and a space, with and inserted before the last item.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is the key functionality that needs to be done here?</p>
<p>Simply put, the main functionality of the code is to take the values in the list and convert this into a string.<br>This should immediately suggest that string.join() would be a good function for this.</p>
<p>As it turns out, we can join the strings with whatever sub-string we like, so by using</p>
<pre><code>', '.join(list_of_strings)
</code></pre>
<p>we get the following transformation:</p>
<pre><code>['apples', 'bananas', 'tofu', 'cats'] -&gt; 'apples, bananas, tofu, cats'
</code></pre>
<p>That's almost the entire task complete! ('join()' handles the 0 and 1 length list arrays correctly, so you don't have to)<br>
We just need to insert the <code>'and '</code>.</p>
<p>A quick analysis of the problem shows that we only need the <code>'and '</code> when there are at least two items, so we write a modification to do just that.<br>We could just add <code>'and'</code> in the penultimate location in the list, but we don't want to end up with <code>['x', 'y'] -&gt; 'x, and, y'</code> so the simple solution to this is to replace the final input in this case with <code>'and '</code> plus the input.</p>
<p>We can do this with one of the following lines:</p>
<pre><code>#python 2+:
list_of_strings[-1] = 'and %s' % list_of_strings[-1]
#python 2.6+:
list_of_strings[-1] = 'and {}'.format(list_of_strings[-1])
#python 3.6+:
list_of_strings[-1] = f'and {list_of_strings[-1]}'
</code></pre>
<p>To ensure that this does not change the input (it may be reused elsewhere) we should make a copy of it first.  The simple way is to create a new list from the original:</p>
<pre><code>list_of_strings = list(input_list_of_strings)
</code></pre>
<p>Putting this all together, we get a fairly simple function as a result:</p>
<pre><code>def comma_code(input_list_of_strings):
    list_of_strings = list(input_list_of_strings)
    if len(list_of_strings) &gt; 1:
        list_of_strings[-1] = f'and {list_of_strings[-1]}'
    return ', '.join(list_of_strings)
</code></pre>

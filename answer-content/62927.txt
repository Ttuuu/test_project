<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>var minutes = Convert.ToDecimal("0." + totalVal[1])*60;
var remainingDecimal = minutes.ToString().Split('.');
</code></pre>

<p>I think the issue is that <code>Decimal.ToString</code>'s formatting will depend on the current culture. A computer with different settings will produce different results. The settings on your computer is such that it produces <code>0.0</code> here. But it could produce <code>0,0</code>, <code>0</code>, or various other crazy things.</p>

<p>As a general practice, don't use the result of <code>.ToString()</code> in computations. It's almost always the wrong way.</p>

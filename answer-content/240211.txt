<p>In regards to performance or efficiency, I don't see anything that begs for attention.</p>

<p>I would suggest <code>Simpson</code> class and its methods be <code>static</code>.  You really are not saving any properties or state between invocations, so <code>static</code> makes more sense.</p>

<p>The method named <code>Function</code> is a horrible name.  Far too generic.</p>

<p>I'm not even keen on the method name <code>Compute</code>, though it is an action verb.  I'd be partial to <code>Integrate</code> which is also an action verb but more descriptive.  The parameter names are decent.  Since Simpson's Rule uses the non-descript <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, it's okay that your method does as well.  Perhaps <code>n</code> could be given a more descriptive name.</p>

<p>Your use of braces and indentation looks good.  Also good that <code>Function</code> is <code>private</code> and <code>Compute</code> is <code>public</code>.  However, you do not provide any validation checks on <code>public</code> methods.  What if someone entered <code>-999</code> as the value for <code>n</code>? </p>

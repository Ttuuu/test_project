<p>I think you're over-complicating the problem -- you need to think of a different approach. </p>

<p>Here's an algorithm: consider the first digit in the linked list. Add it to the "running total." If there's another number in the list, multiply it by 10*(number count) and add it to the running total. Keep going until you run out of new numbers.</p>

<p>Think of it this way for an input of 8-&gt;3-&gt;4:</p>

<p>1) Set runningTotal to 8 initially.<br>
2) There's another item in the list; multiply 3 by 10*1 to get 30. Add to running total. New running total: 38.<br>
3) There's another item in the list; multiply 4 by 10*2 to get 400. Add to running total. New running total: 483.</p>

<p>And so on. This works for lists of any size.</p>

<p>Make a function that will convert a linked list to an integer as described as above, and then you just need to add up the results for both lists. </p>

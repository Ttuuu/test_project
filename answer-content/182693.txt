<p>I agree with <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/182680/120114">the advice</a> from <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/39953/i-wrestled-a-bear-once">I wrestled a bear once</a> - especially about the DOM queries each time the function is run. If you did need to alter DOM elements when a function is run, it is best to store a reference to any such DOM elements in a variable when the DOM is ready and use that variable whenever the function is run. </p>

<p>In your original code, these three lines appear to exist in both functions (i.e. <code>lightsOff()</code> and <code>lightsOn()</code>). If you were to keep those variables, those assignment lines can be moved out to the <code>handleDocumentLoad()</code> function, since they are the same in both functions. This fits the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><em>Don't Repeat Yourself</em></a></strong>
 (i.e. D.R.Y.) principle.</p>

<pre><code>offSwitch = document.getElementById("lightSwitchOff"); //Targets div with ID lightSwitchOff
onSwitch = document.getElementById("lightSwitchOn"); //Targets div with ID lightSwitchOn
style = document.getElementById("pageStyle"); //Targets stylsheet
</code></pre>

<p>This code still doesn't work.</p>

<pre><code>with open("C:\\Users\\Andy\\Desktop\\queries.txt").read().splitlines() as f, 0 as i:
</code></pre>

<p>will cause two errors since lists and integers don't have an <code>__enter__</code> method.</p>

<p>I still know roughly what you're going for though, so I can make some suggestions about the rest of the code.</p>

<hr>

<p>Even if <code>0 as i</code> did work, that would be an abuse of <code>with</code>. If you want to define a variable, just use the typical <code>i = 0</code> syntax.</p>

<hr>

<p>Your condition in the <code>if</code> is far over complicated. Running it, the intent seems to be just to check if a number is odd or zero. That can be made much simpler:</p>

<pre><code>if i % 2 == 1 or i == 0:
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>You duplicate</p>

<pre><code>call('start firefox.exe https://duckduckgo.com/?q=' + f[i].replace(" ", "+"), shell=True)
</code></pre>

<p>in each branch of the <code>if</code>. That's not necessary though. Really, that whole check is just so you can add a timeout if <code>i</code> is even. That bit can be reduced down to</p>

<pre><code>while True:
    call('start firefox.exe https://duckduckgo.com/?q=' + f[i].replace(" ", "+"), shell=True)

    if i % 2 == 0 and i != 0:
        call('timeout 120')

    i += 1
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>You could also get rid of the need for <code>i += 1</code> but iterating over a <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html#itertools.count" rel="nofollow noreferrer">count</a> object instead. It's basically an infinite <code>range</code>:</p>

<pre><code>for i in count():
    call('start firefox.exe https://duckduckgo.com/?q=' + f[i].replace(" ", "+"), shell=True)

    if i % 2 == 0 and i != 0:
        call('timeout 120')
</code></pre>

<p>Of course though, this maintains the impossible condition that <code>f</code> is a file of infinite length.</p>

<p>You didn't include any specific request, so here are some general comments.</p>

<h2>comments / documentation</h2>

<p>You say it's been a while since you wrote it.  When you look at the code now, are there places you ask yourself "why did I do that?" or where it takes time to figure out what is going on?  If so, those are good places to add comments.</p>

<p>Also docstrings could be added to the file and the functions.</p>

<h2>random_hour(start, end)</h2>

<p>The writeup says it returns a random time between start and end.  However, it actually returns a random timedelta between start and <code>end</code> + 59 minutes.  Also, similar python functions tend to include the <code>start</code> and exclude the <code>end</code> (e.g. randrange), so it would be good to document this.</p>

<h2>random_weight(total_working_hours)</h2>

<p>dicts() are not guaranteed to be ordered until Python 3.7.  So i==0 may not correspond to <code>in_orc</code>.  It would be better to iterate over the keys and check if the key=='in_orc'.</p>

<p><code>min_hour</code> is calculated but never used.  I think it is supposed to be <code>area</code>.</p>

<h2>module level code</h2>

<p>It is common to put the top level code in a function such as <code>main()</code>.  And the call <code>main()</code> from code such as</p>

<pre><code>if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</code></pre>

<h2>csv module</h2>

<p>The standard library includes the <code>csv</code> module for reading a writting csv and other kinfs of delimited text files.  It takes care of escaping characters or enclosing strings in quotes if needed.</p>

<h2>unpacking</h2>

<p>Instead of using <code>for i in range(0,6)</code> to iterate over the employees, use something like:</p>

<pre><code>for employee_code, employee_name in employees:
    ...
</code></pre>

<h2>locals()</h2>

<p>The python documentation says the dictionary returned by <code>locals()</code> should NOT be modified.  The changes may not be picked up by the interpreter.</p>

<p>That's enough for now.</p>

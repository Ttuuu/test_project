<p>Do something about the code formatting (intendation) in this question. The code reads really awful.</p>

<h3>Review of Piece</h3>

<ul>
<li><code>Piece</code> has an instance variable of the same type, which is stored through the <em>copy constructor</em>, but unused in the class.</li>
<li>Many variables belong together <code>x1, y1</code> etc.. Consider creating a class <code>EuclidPoint</code> which groups and <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> value. You can offset some arithmic and euclidean operations in this class. For instance <code>move</code>, <code>rotate</code>, <code>reflect</code>, <code>invert</code>, and also variants specifically for <code>x</code> or <code>y</code>.</li>
<li>Use common names for your operations. <code>turnAround</code> is a rotation around a point (I think) so use <code>rotate</code> instead.</li>
<li><code>getMinXCoordinate</code> could be made more extensible and usable if it would allow a dynamic number of values or an array, instead of <code>int x1, int x2, int x3, int x4</code>. It should also be called <code>getMinCoordinate</code>, why specific for <code>x</code>?</li>
<li>the constructor <code>Piece(int f)</code> should be extracted to a class named <code>PieceFactory</code>. This to avoid convolution of specific shapes with the general intend of the class.</li>
</ul>

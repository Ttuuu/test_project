<h1>The command</h1>

<pre><code>// cmd : cp file1 file2
</code></pre>

<p>You then say:</p>

<pre><code>    std::cout &lt;&lt; "missing arguments: moderncp file1 file2 ";
</code></pre>

<p>Is it <code>cp file1 file2</code> or <code>moderncp file1 file2</code>? </p>

<p>In addition, I would provide more extensive documentation. What does <code>cp</code> do? The comment: <code>// cmd : cp file1 file2</code> should be comprehensive enough for me to understand what <code>cp</code> is and I should <em>not</em> have to use Google to figure it out. Using something like <a href="http://www.doxygen.nl/index.html" rel="noreferrer">Doxygen</a> to provide more incentive to document may be helpful.</p>

<h1>Handling Failure</h1>

<pre><code>    return 0;
</code></pre>

<p>The program failed. I have used <code>EXIT_FAILURE</code> in the past (in C), however, this would require <code>cstdlib</code> which I am not sure is a good idea. Nonetheless, <code>0</code> is reserved for a successful run, even <code>return 1;</code> would be better. (Maybe someone can comment on this?)</p>

<h1>Comments</h1>

<pre><code>// create a vector with 1024 byte allocated 
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, I understand you created a 1024 byte vector, but you have not told me <em>why</em>. It's named <code>buf</code> so I know it is a buffer, but for what? </p>

<h1>Style</h1>

<p>C++ does not have an equivalent to PEP 8, so technically as long as your style is consistent it is "correct". However, I usually see a blank line (or two) between the includes and functions, so:</p>

<pre><code>#include&lt;unistd.h&gt;
int main(int argc,char* argv[]) {
</code></pre>

<p>becomes:</p>

<pre><code>#include&lt;unistd.h&gt;

int main(int argc,char* argv[]) {
</code></pre>

<p>I have also seen spaces between arguments more often than not, so:</p>

<pre><code>int infd = open(input.c_str(),O_RDONLY);
</code></pre>

<p>becomes:</p>

<pre><code>int infd = open(input.c_str(), O_RDONLY);
</code></pre>

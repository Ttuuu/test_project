<p>Thanks for putting this code online! Two updates for people who may want to use it:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Correctness: The "<em>if self.n &gt; self.k:</em>" is probably mistaken: for instance, when the sequence starts with k times the same element, we are later stuck with a data structure that contains a single counter. Instead, we can use self.k as representing the number of remaining counters with value 0: specifically, replace this line by "<em>if self.k==0:</em>" and just after the "<em>else:</em>" insert "<em>self.k=self.k-1</em>".</p></li>
<li><p>Small optimization: above "<em>def push</em>", replace by "<em>self.push(self.counts[x], self.n, x)</em>", i.e. use the latest value of x since we just updated it</p></li>
</ol>

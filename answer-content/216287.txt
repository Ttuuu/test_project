<p>I'm afraid you can't do this like that, because <code>NR</code> is a number of an input record, not a number of records matched so far. Even if it was, you need to count records matched by the first clause of the condition but actually <em>not</em> yet printed due to the second clause.</p>

<p>Probably the good way to do that is explicit counting:</p>

<pre><code>BEGIN { cnt = N }
/[a-z]/&amp;&amp;!/.txt/ { if (cnt-- == 0) print  $3 }
</code></pre>

<p>I am not sure, however, how to pass an argument from the command line to the script's variable <code>N</code>.</p>

<p>The question I have is why do you have 17K rows when there are only 200+ countries. Are the country names translated in many languages perhaps ? Isn't it conceivable to use a simplified dataset ? What does the current dataset look like ?</p>

<p>When you're saying "Its taking too long", do you mean the function is too slow (how long does it take on average ?), or it is because you have a lot of data to process ?
If some of the data is repetitive, perhaps you could regroup the identical records so as to call the function only once instead of repeating the process for each row.
Basically, reorder the data a bit before processing by your script.</p>

<p>Maybe the task could be performed equally fine in SQL, for example from a <strong>SQLite</strong> DB with an appropriate <code>LIKE</code> or a <code>MATCH</code> clause (or even <code>soundex</code> - <em>not available by default, requires recompilation</em>), possibly using <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/fts5.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">FTS</a> or <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/partialindex.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">(partial) indexes</a>.</p>

<p>I agree with Anonymous that there isn't much to review here.</p>
<p>I would like to point out a few general things.</p>
<p>The db connection credentials are the type of thing that I'd put in a config.php file and include it where necessary.</p>
<p><code>$timezone</code> is probably going to be useless in the longterm.  <code>date_default_timezone_set()</code> returns a boolean value to inform you of whether or not you have supplied a valid timezone.  Basically, once this tested once, there is no need to check the return value ever again (until it is changed, of course).</p>
<pre><code>$dbCredentials = [
    "localhost", //server name
    "username",
    "password",
    database"database"
];

date_default_timezone_set("America/New_York");
</code></pre>
<p>Then just <code>include</code> the file and connect by unpacking the indexed array of credentials like this:</p>
<pre><code>$con = new mysqli(...$dbCredentials);
</code></pre>
<p>Notice this is object-oriented syntax.  You should not be mixing styles.</p>
<p>When you are in a development environment (not a production environment), you may return raw error messages. In production, you must never provide raw error messages to users.</p>
<p>When checking for a failed connection, a falsey check (no function call) will be sufficient.  It is vital that you spell your connection variable correctly.</p>
<pre><code>if (!$con) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $con-&gt;connect_error);
}
</code></pre>
<p>That said, an overarching refinement is to perform error handling elsewhere. See <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/243749/141885">YourCommonSense's advice on error reporting</a>.</p>
<p><code>session_start();</code> is usually something that you would put at the top of an include that is run before anything else.</p>

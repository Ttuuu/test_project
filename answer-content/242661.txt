<p>It is normally good to break code into several methods.
Everything that is inside your</p>

<p><code>if(!hit.equals(p) &amp;&amp; !me.equals(p))</code> </p>

<p>should be moved to a separate method taking as input those 3 points a,b and c</p>

<p>When coding problems of a mathematical flavor it is often very useful to support your code with some kind of theory.</p>

<p>In this case you might want to look up the mathematical terms "dot product" and "cross product". Once you understand those it becomes easy to implement your function.</p>

<p>And remember to make several functions (dotProduct() and crossProduct()) so you can reuse code later.</p>

<p>When it comes to performance you need to look at your algorithm.
There is no need to test all pairs of points (hit, p).
Maybe you should make a small method that computes the angle of a vector from me to p? If angle is the same they hit, otherwise they miss. </p>

<p>So the question becomes given a list of angles for points in hits and a list of angles in reachable, do they contain a common angle?</p>

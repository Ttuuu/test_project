<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>I would like to point out few things in your code:-</p>

<ol>
<li><p>This should be at the first place of your function.</p>

<p>if(typeof(arr) === 'undefined' || arr.length === 0) {
    return 0
 }</p></li>
<li><p>You have used arrow function here which is of no use here, as according to rules if I tell you, arrow function must be used in one liner function.</p></li>
<li><p>You could have not used anonymous function or have used class.</p></li>
<li><p>Hardest part here, what you could have done is just find the element next to 0 and before 0 after sorting it, compare there diff with 0, which has least that is the closest element.</p></li>
</ol>
    </div>

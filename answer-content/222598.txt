<p>Your tests look ok. I have three concerns:</p>

<ul>
<li><s>If I read correctly, your "single digit modifications" test cycle is going to have over 1000000000000000000000 cycles. That's... not practical. pick a compromise.</s> </li>
<li>The positive tests are checking <code>calculate</code> and <code>validate</code>. I see no reason not to check both in your negative tests too. </li>
<li>You're only checking <em>syntactically valid</em> input. This ties into your question about what the type signature should be. 

<ul>
<li>You have a few options for your type signature. Without going over the compromises in detail, I would suggest that the first line in <code>calculate</code> and <code>validate</code> should be an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.isdigit" rel="nofollow noreferrer">isdigit()</a> check, and raise an exception if it fails. </li>
<li>Whatever you do for types, your tests should check that it's handling edge cases <em>as intended</em>, whatever it is you decide you intend.

<ul>
<li>empty strings</li>
<li>a single digit (could break <code>validate</code>)</li>
<li>all zeros</li>
<li>whitespace in different configurations</li>
<li>illegal characters</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>You don't <em>have</em> to address all these points, depending on the use-cases of this project, and whatever else is going on in your life, it may be fine to call it good enough as-is.</p>

<p>One thing to also include is the fact that it also doesn't support series in which each term alternates between positive and negative as the <code>series = series.split("+")</code></p>

<p>For example in an arithmetic series like <code>5+3+1-1-3</code> with a common difference of -2, 
the way the <code>series = series.split("+")</code> is set up, will make it detect <code>1-1-3</code> as a single term.</p>

<p>And in geometric terms, for example: <code>9-3+1-(1/3)+(1/9)</code>, it will again fail to detect the <code>-</code> and mistake <code>9-3</code> and <code>1-(1/3)</code> as complete terms.</p>

<p>A viable solution is to separate every term whether negative or not by a <code>+</code>.
Using the two examples above:</p>

<ul>
<li>Arithmetic: <code>"5+3+1+-1+-3"</code></li>
<li>Geometric:  <code>f"9+-3+1+-{1/3}+{1/9}"</code></li>
</ul>

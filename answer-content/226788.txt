<p>Algorithm: because of the recursion, it still doesn't qualify as in-place. Consider a variation on a Morris traversal theme.</p>

<hr>

<p>The calls to <code>first()</code> and <code>last()</code> are detrimental to the performance. Meanwhile, the callee already computed them. Consider returning a (fake) node pointing the beginning and the end of the flattened subtree, along the lines</p>

<pre><code>    left = flatten(root.left);
    right = flatten(root.right);

    left.right.next = root;
    root.left = left.right;

    right.left.left = root;
    root.right = right.left;

    return Node(left.left, right.right);
</code></pre>

<p>There is only <span class="math-container">\$O(h)\$</span> <code>Nodes</code> to exist at any given moment, so the space complexity is not compromised.</p>

<p>It's not a direct answer to your technical question, which you seem to have answered.</p>

<p>I'm not sure that the <code>Player.loggedAt</code> field should be set when <code>store()</code> is called.  We only see a very small fraction of your app, but maybe that could be set somewhere else more naturally.  From the name, it seems maybe it should be set when the <code>Player</code> is created, or recreated from the DB.</p>

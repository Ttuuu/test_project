<p>Some suggestions -</p>

<ul>
<li>Take a read through <code>https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/enum</code>. Unless you have a really good reason (i.e. compatibility with an external API), leave out the <code>=0</code>, <code>=1</code>... in your enum.</li>
<li>Whenever you have a function block <code>{}</code>, even if it's empty, don't add <code>;</code> after.</li>
<li>I'm fairly sure (?) that pure virtual functions cannot accept arbitrary pointer suffixes, so using <code>NULL</code> is misleading (even though it technically produces the desired result). Just use 0.</li>
<li>In your switch, you have <code>return; break</code> - but the break is not necessary, since the return exits before the break is seen. Maybe you have it in due to a pedantic linter, but I'd drop it.</li>
<li>The C++ "one true path" is to destroy things instead of explicitly closing them. As such, in your <code>main</code>, you can create a scope block around your use of <code>dataFile</code>. When the object goes out of scope, it will be closed and destroyed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nice job.  Here's two comments to add to what other's have said.</p>

<h3>range() excludes the stop point</h3>

<p>The built-in function <code>range(start, stop, step)</code> does not include <code>stop</code> in the items it returns.  So in <code>generate_card()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>min_ = 1
max_ = 15
...
random.sample(range(min_, max_), 5)
</code></pre>

<p>only selects from the numbers 1, 2, 3, ..., 14.  <code>max_</code> should be 16.  I sometimes write code with an explicit <code>+1</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code> random.sample(range(min_, max_+1), 5)
</code></pre>

<p>to remind myself that I intended to include <code>max_</code> in the range.</p>

<h3>Separation of concerns</h3>

<p>When a function in a program does multiple unrelated things, it may make the program more difficult to debug, modify, or enhance.  For example, <code>draw()</code> gets the next numbered ball and adds it to the BINGO card.  If a the player could have multiple bingo cards, each card would be drawing it's own random balls.  Clearly, that wouldn't work.  It would be better if the ball was drawn separately and then checked against each card.  </p>

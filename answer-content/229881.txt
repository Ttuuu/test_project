<p>You are missing charset in your DSN and you have emulated prepared statements still on. This could potentially leave your vulnerable to SQL injection. See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/134099/are-pdo-prepared-statements-sufficient-to-prevent-sql-injection">Are PDO prepared statements sufficient to prevent SQL injection?</a><br>
As I have pointed out to you in an <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/58142127/1839439">answer on Stack Overflow</a> you should set the proper charset and disable emulated prepared statements. </p>

<pre><code>$options = [
    \PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE =&gt; \PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION,
    \PDO::ATTR_DEFAULT_FETCH_MODE =&gt; \PDO::FETCH_ASSOC,
    \PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES =&gt; false,
];
$conn = new \PDO("mysql:host=$servername;dbname=$dbname;charset=utf8mb4", $username, $password, $options);
</code></pre>

<p>I do not know why you have 2 PDO connections opened, you need only one. </p>

<p>Also, you should enable error reporting for PDO and avoid using try-catch in your code, if all you do is display the error message on the screen.</p>

<p>Using <code>bindParam</code> seems completely unnecessary. It would be much more readable to pass the values in <code>execute()</code></p>

<p>Brackets around variables are just noise and serve no purpose. e.g. <code>($_POST['addcomments'])</code></p>

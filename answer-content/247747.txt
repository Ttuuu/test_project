<p>The variable names are not good.</p>
<p>What is <code>f</code>?  What is <code>d</code>?  What does <code>SNAKE_COMP</code> even mean? I understand the first two values in it to be coordinates, but what is the third, and since it's always 2, why is it not a constant?</p>
<p>What does <code>hit</code> mean? Hitting the wall? Hitting food? Hitting another snake? Collision is another common term which is a bit more clear.</p>
<p>What is <code>FOOD_COORS</code>? Is it supposed to be COOR<strong>D</strong>S ?</p>
<p>I guess <code>d</code> is direction. Then name it <code>direction</code>. And use names for the directions, don't call them 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
<p>If you make the code readable, it increases the chance that others will take time to read it and give feedback.</p>

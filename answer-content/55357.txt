<p>Well, the first thing I would recommend is replacing all of those <code>println</code> statements with some kind of logging. In any kind of production environment, logging is something that needs more thought and care so that it is useful, without consuming resources unnecessarily. Or, if they're just for the original developer during development, maybe delete them.</p>

<p>I find the structure of this code to be rather odd. For all the trappings of OO programming, what you essentially have is two global public functions and one global public variable.</p>

<p>The function name <code>setQ</code> doesn't seem to say what you're actually doing - which appears to be creating a channel and publishing a message to it. <code>publishMessage</code> would make more sense, I think.</p>

<p>All of the code that checks the usability of the connection should be extracted into a single function, something along the lines of <code>haveUsableConnection</code> - the two if/else blocks are making it hard to see the code that is actually doing the work.</p>

<p>I question the hard coded IP address. Magic numbers and magic strings are frequently a bad idea.</p>

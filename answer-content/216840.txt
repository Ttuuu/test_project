<p>This is a quick review to cover an important issue not already mentioned.</p>

<h2>Fix the bug</h2>

<p>When a user logs out, shouldn’t <code>attempts</code> be reset to 0?  Otherwise a single user can effectively lock out the entire bank. There are other circumstances that should also reset <code>attempts</code> so you should think carefully about where those are.</p>

<h2>Rethink the class operation</h2>

<p>Does it really make sense to lock the entire bank in response to excessive failed login attempts? Or would it make more sense to lock the single account?  Also, the username and password are closely associated but in two separate data structures. I’d be inclined to define an <code>Account</code> class and have a vector of those.</p>

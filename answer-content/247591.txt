<p>This is just a short review to complement the nice one already posted by G. Sliepen.</p>
<h2>Use only the allowed forms of <code>main</code></h2>
<p>The code currently includes this line:</p>
<pre><code>int main(int argc, const char **argv)
</code></pre>
<p>However, there are only two forms of <code>main</code> allowed by the standard:</p>
<pre><code>int main(int argc, char *argv[])  // note no const!
int main()
</code></pre>
<h2>Consider calculating a Levenshtein distance</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Levenstein distance</a> calculation would probably yield a much more concise way to express what went wrong.  By calculating and then traversing a Wagner-Fisher matrix, you can very concisely describe the minimum number of insertions, deletions and substitutions that could have transpired to produce the observed result.</p>

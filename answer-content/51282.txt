<p>I can see your implementation as a nice example of async programming. Being async enables you to keep your UI responsive while waiting for the response. You may not be so convinced as you just need to make a call and why do you need to wait for it? But the reason is responsiveness of the UI that gives a nice impression to user while waiting for the results.</p>

<p>Async programming works best when you have multiple tasks to do for example you pull results from your db and perform some tasks on each of the record returned eg. send mail, process invoices, print faxes etc.</p>

<p>So as conclusion the concerned piece of code would only show responsive UI while waiting for the result if the db connection is slow of it take longer to respond. There is nothing wrong in your code and it is already optimized nicely.</p>

<p>I would agree that what you have now is cleaner and more testable (in comparison to the code you said you might have written before).</p>

<p>I don't know C++ but I'm familiar with validation, so I'll stick to that.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When adding a Product, I think it's best not to explicity set an ID. I'm assuming these entries are going to a database of some sorts (relational, key, or anything else). If this is the case, let the database set the ID, or let it tell you what ID comes up next.</p></li>
<li><p>I think it's limiting to have restrictions on name length. I could see an eCommerce store selling an ax. I'm not sure why you'd limit one and two letter words (why not three or four letter words);just check if there's a name at all.</p></li>
<li><p>Similar principle with the price. Supposedly it can't be less than 1. What if the store offers a holiday sale and the $1 item is 50% off, and the $0.25 is free! I'm just thinking of all the possible ways you could run into problems down the road.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, you set price as an <code>int</code>. This is fine, except now there's no cents. I suggest another variable handling the cents (also an int, limited to two digits).</p></li>
</ul>

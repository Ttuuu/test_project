<p>This question is borderline off-topic for Code Review, but, I find that in reviewing what little code you have, there is actually a lot to say.</p>

<p>Your question asks whether <code>&lt;span ...&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code> is OK when compared to a specific tag, like <code>&lt;font ...&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</code>. This <a href="https://codereview.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1773/should-comparisons-of-code-snippets-be-closed-as-not-seeking-a-code-review">A vs. B style of question has been discussed on Meta</a>.</p>

<p>In this case, <em>neither system you have is best.</em> The best thing is to remove the styling from the local element, and apply it using CSS classes, in which case, span would be fine, but not with a <code>style</code> attribute, but with a <code>class</code> attribute.</p>

<p>Also, your solution is very, very limited. You have already identified the problem with your regex where it does not accomodate <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> in the 'value' content, but what about the opposite problem, spaces in the first part of the style? For example, how do you set a span with the font style: <code>font-family: Gill Sans Extrabold, sans-serif;</code>?</p>

<p>So, use a style sheet, and reference a class in your span.</p>

<p>First thing I'd like to say is get into the habit of putting your code into functions outside of Main.  Use Main to run the functions.  In this case, I would recommend passing in PrintStream and  LocalDate objects.</p>

<p>You seem to be doing a lot of work with the LocalDate fields.  Basically all the printout is is a list of numbers in a tabular format.  All you need is the weekday of the first day of the month to get the offset.  Use a loop to get the numbers and when <code>(weekday - 1 + loop counter) % 7</code> equals 0 print a line break.</p>

<p>Using <code>printf</code> to format the numbers with leading 0's, makes the print out much easier to read.</p>

<p>Typically when printing out the month one would expect to see the name of the month and the year, as well as the days of the week.  The days of the week can be pulled from the DayOfWeek enum.</p>

<p>Here's one way the function could look like:</p>

<pre><code>private static void printMonth(PrintStream out, LocalDate date){
    date = date.minusDays(date.getDayOfMonth()-1);
    var month = date.getMonth();
    int days = month.length(date.isLeapYear());
    int firstWeekDay = date.getDayOfWeek().getValue()-1;
    out.printf("%1$s, %2$d\n",month.toString(),date.getYear());        
    for(var weekday :DayOfWeek.values()){
        out.printf("%s\t",weekday.name().substring(0, 2));
    }
    out.println();
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; firstWeekDay;++i){
        out.print("  \t");
    }
    for(int day = 1; day &lt;= days;++day){
        out.printf("%02d\t",day );
        if((day + firstWeekDay)% 7 ==0){
            out.println();
        }
    }
    out.println();
}
</code></pre>

<p>The print out looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>NOVEMBER, 2018
MO  TU  WE  TH  FR  SA  SU  
            01  02  03  04  
05  06  07  08  09  10  11  
12  13  14  15  16  17  18  
19  20  21  22  23  24  25  
26  27  28  29  30
</code></pre>

<p>Adding to what Gerard has answered, there are some PHP libraries that deal with time very well which you could implement. One example is <a href="https://carbon.nesbot.com/docs/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Carbon</a>.</p>

<p>I would separate out your date comparisons into its own function. May be useful elsewhere and is a little clearer. Everything in your for loop up to your first if statement could be its own function.</p>

<p>You could improve your formatting a little (don't know if copy and pasting into Stack Exchange has caused it) but you can take a look at <a href="https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PSR-2</a>. Naming variables a little clearer will be helpful to you, those reviewing your code and to anybody who may now/in the future work on this code, e.g. <code>mytime_start</code> doesn't make it clear what time you are talking about, and <code>index</code> could simply be referred to as the standard <code>i</code>.</p>

<p>Remember to <a href="http://docs.php.net/manual/da/language.oop5.typehinting.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">type hint</a> your parameters and give <a href="https://mlocati.github.io/articles/php-type-hinting.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">return values</a>.</p>

<p>Hope this helps a bit!</p>

<p>Your colleague code is clearly focused on <code>readability</code> while your code is focused on <code>simplicity</code>. You both have a good points (excluding the <code>ToLower()</code>).</p>

<p>You must keep in mind that some changes can't be <code>beneficial</code>, while others would not improve the performance much, but it would boost up code clarity and flexibility.</p>

<p>First take the roles : </p>

<pre><code>x.Role.Name == RoleNames.SENDERSADMIN || x.Role.Name == RoleNames.ADMIN
</code></pre>

<p>this seems to me a general user role, where it's used in multiple places. If that's the case it would more easier if it's converted into a role class where it can be used something like this : 
<code>UserRole.IsUserOrSenderAdmin(x.Role.Name)</code> or using extension <code>x.Role.Name.IsUserOrSenderAdmin()</code> Another way is to have a property inside the <code>Role</code> property like this <code>x.Role.IsAdmin || x.Role.IsSenderAdmin</code> So, you are defining the general roles conditions inside the model itself. Which would be accessed directly. This would make it easier to handle roles (or user permissions) instead of repeating the same condition or having long condition like this one. This would add clarity and simplification to the used conditions. </p>

<p>The second part <code>ToLower</code>, you need to use <code>StringComparison</code> instead. 
so this : </p>

<pre><code>x.TopicFilter.Name.ToLower() == item.Topic.Name.ToLower()
</code></pre>

<p>would be converted to this : </p>

<pre><code>x.TopicFilter.Name.Equals(item.Topic.Name, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase);
</code></pre>

<p>This will avoid creating extra strings along with using the safe default for culture-agnostic string matching.</p>

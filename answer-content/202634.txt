<p>Defining constants with #define is only ok in c. In C++ there are better alternatives. Consider using  instead <code>const int</code> or an <code>enum</code> for the states instead of <code>#define</code> in C++98. </p>

<p>If C++11 would be available you could even change the <code>#define</code>  to <code>constexpr</code>.</p>

<p>Is there a reason to use <code>unsigned int</code>? it is usually not worth using it. The extra precision you gain is  not worth it since it can lead to obscure bugs. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22587451/c-c-use-of-int-or-unsigned-int">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22587451/c-c-use-of-int-or-unsigned-int</a></p>

<p><code>return 0</code> is not necessary to be added in the <code>main</code> function in c++. By definition it is auto generated by the compiler. This only applys for main.</p>

<p>Consider making a Actor class were you create the Actor take damage etc.</p>

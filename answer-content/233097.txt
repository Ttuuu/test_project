<p>LGTM. Ship it!</p>

<p>There were two minor nits that seemed slightly off:</p>

<ol>
<li>The use of <code>*</code> in the signature to force kw args is maybe overused, as it covers args that are pretty mandatory.</li>
<li>The <code>print(*tasks, sep='\n')</code> would more naturally be handled by this idiom, which is reusable outside of print(): <code>print('\n'.join(tasks))</code> </li>
</ol>

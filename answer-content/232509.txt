<p><code>getGameObject</code> - Never used. You should remove it. You can always use <code>this</code>, no need to have a function. If you meant for this to be <code>protected</code>, still remove it. Again use the object, no need to have a function.</p>

<p><code>ImMaterialGameObject</code> - Unless "Im" stands for something, <code>Immaterial</code> is one word.</p>

<p><code>public Object filling;</code> - You've obviously noticed all classes in Java extend from Object. Taking advantage of this is hackey. Instead you could use 2 separate fields and check if one or the other is null.</p>

<p><strong>Onto the question "Is there a better approach?"</strong></p>

<p>Without knowing what you're using this for, I'd say there's nothing wrong with your approach. To make things more clear, set <code>GameObject</code> to <code>abstract</code>. </p>

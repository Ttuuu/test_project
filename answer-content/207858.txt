<p>Other than the elephant in the room (this isn't a justified use of <code>goto</code>), I have some other nitpicks:</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm uncomfortable passing an array as an argument. A pointer - sure; a reference to an array - sure. Since you're in C++ I'd go with the reference-to-array.</li>
<li>The various <code>+= 1</code> and <code>-= 1</code> can simply be <code>++</code> and <code>--</code>.</li>
<li>Your <code>else</code> isn't necessary. You've already jumped prior to that line.</li>
</ul>

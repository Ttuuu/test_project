<p>You want shorter?  I don't think these improve anything, but they're fewer lines of code.</p>

<pre><code>l1, l2 = len(arr1), len(arr2)

if l1 &lt; l2:
    arr1, l1, arr2, l2 = arr2, l2, arr1, l1

    short_arr, lshort, long_arr, llong = arr2, l2, arr1, l1
</code></pre>

<p>or maybe</p>

<pre><code>if len(arr1) &lt; len(arr2):
    arr1, arr2 = arr2, arr1

short_arr, lshort, long_arr, llong = arr2, len(arr2), arr1, len(arr1)
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>if len(arr1) &lt; len(arr2):
    arr1, arr2 = arr2, arr1

short_arr = arr2
long_arr = arr1
lshort = len(arr2)
llong = len(arr1)
</code></pre>

<p>Admittedly, this doesn't leave the lists how they were at first.</p>

<p>Personally, if I had to choose between my hacks, AJNeufeld's permutations, or your code, I'd go with your code.</p>

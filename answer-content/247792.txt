<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>You could basically turn the logic around, something like:</p>
<pre><code>int totalpages = -1;
int currentPage = 0;
do {
    RestPage&lt;Item&gt; page = Client.getItems(itemsPerPage, currentPage);
    result.addAll(page.getContent());
    totalpages = page.getTotalPages(); // provided, that *every* page contains the total number
    currentPage++;
}
while(currentPage &lt; totalpages); // or &lt;=, I don't know that API
</code></pre>
<p>This way, you don't duplicate the fetch-code.</p>
<p>As streams are no goal in itself, I recommend keeping it this simple, as long as you don't have any problems with caching all results in memory at once. You <em>could</em> write a Spliterator which basically performs the loop-body internally, but this is a complex problem in itself.</p>
    </div>

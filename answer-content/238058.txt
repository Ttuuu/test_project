<p><code>return</code> returns the value, in this case the dictionary <code>birthdays</code>, whereas <code>print</code> just prints the value to the terminal. Your printing might be improved by using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings" rel="nofollow noreferrer">f-strings</a>. This is usually a bit easier than having to use "+" inside your print statements. So for example, instead of </p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>print(new_name + "'s birthday has been added as " + new_birthday)
</code></pre>

<p>You could write:</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>print(f"{new_name}'s birthday has been added as {new_birthday}")
</code></pre>

<p>This combined with a generator could also make your dictionary printing a little neater:</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>print("\n".join([f"{name}'s birthday is {bday}" for name,bday in birthdays.items()]))
</code></pre>

<p>The generator creates a list of strings for each item in the <code>birthdays</code> dictionary, so in this case, it would generate the list <code>["Jon's birthday is July 17","Shauna's birthday is Jan 27", "Lynette's birthday is July 10"]</code>. The <code>join()</code> function is used to combine each element of this list into a new string, separated by the newline character <code>\n</code>. So the final result would produce:
<code>
Jon's birthday is July 17
Shauna's birthday is Jan 27
Lynette's birthday is July 10
</code></p>

<p>If you want to further extend this code, I'd recommend representing the birthday as a <code>date</code> object, from the Python built-in library <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/datetime.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>datetime</code></a>. Then you could also add the functionality of easily telling how many days until someone's birthday and other features like that.</p>

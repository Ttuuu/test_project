<p>Regarding this code:</p>

<pre><code>my @b;
for $a { @b.push( ( $_ &gt;= $b &amp; $_ &lt;= $c ).so ) };
so (False) ∈ @b;
</code></pre>

<p>I'm sure that Raku has some form of the <a href="https://docs.raku.org/routine/any" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>any</code> operator</a> that would make this code a one-liner. Having a three-liner is definitely not idiomatic Raku. :)</p>

<p>Did you intentionally use the <code>&amp;</code> operator instead of <code>&amp;&amp;</code>? I'd think that <code>&amp;&amp;</code> is more efficient, but that may only be my knowledge from other programming languages. I don't have any experience with Raku. From what I read about <a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/Junction" rel="nofollow noreferrer">junctions</a>, there should be an easier way to express this.</p>

<p>Your code is hard to read since you use the meaningless variable names <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code>. It would have been better to call two of them <code>min</code> and <code>max</code>. The third can then go by any other name.</p>

<p>I would have expected the operator to be <code>α $min $x $max ω</code>, but that's not what you chose. In that case, I would have probably named the operator <code>in_range</code> and made it an infix operator in the form <code>$x in_range ($min .. $max)</code>, if that's possible at all.</p>

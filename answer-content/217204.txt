<p>There's no particular ordering of characters' code-points in C (other than the digits <code>0</code>..<code>9</code>).  This code assumes (for example) that <code>'['</code> is less than <code>'`'</code>, but that's not the case in EBCDIC at least.</p>

<p>I think you might be better off creating a table of boolean values, and indexing into that with the (unsigned value of) <code>ch</code>, in the way that standard <code>&lt;ctype.h&gt;</code> functions are normally implemented.  This will probably improve performance (one lookup, rather than up to 11 comparisons, per call).</p>

<p>Alternatively, and depending on what characters are considered "delimiters", you may be able to use standard library functions (e.g. <code>isalnum()</code>) in combination.</p>

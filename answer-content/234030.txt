<p>I had a hard time finding out how to actually call this code, because there is no obvious single entry point.</p>

<p>Instead of starting the code with the character constants, you should start it with the main function to be called.</p>

<p>It Kotlin you can define top-level functions, therefore you should not hide the entry point as a method on a constant.</p>

<pre><code>fun loadAutodetectCharset(file: File): String {
}
</code></pre>

<p>The remaining classes should be made <code>private</code>, as far as they are implementation details.</p>

<p>How do you intend that other people can plug their own language and encoding detectors into your framework? If it's only by defining the list of characters, they don't need the complicated API of deriving from an open class.</p>

<p>In additions to <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/231151/207526">konijn's remarks</a> I would add some other that I would normally add reviewing this code.</p>

<p><strong>Explicit type declarations</strong></p>

<p>In the following code there is no need to declare type:</p>

<pre><code>public debug: boolean = false;
</code></pre>

<p>The TypeScritpt compiler will understand the type from the assigned value. </p>

<p><strong>Methods with side effects</strong></p>

<p>You have a method <code>checkForChanges(edit: string)</code>. It is not obvious from the method name that it produces side effects (changes the component's state). I would suggest you to rename the method to make it clear. Maybe <code>propagateChanges</code>?</p>

<p><strong>Fields/variables naming</strong></p>

<p>It is probably a matter of taste, but I would suggest you to use names starting with the underscore sign (<code>_value</code>) as less as possible. The only valid case I know is when you want to have <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/45167446/2065796">a getter with the same name</a>, but it is not the case here.</p>

<p><strong>Use of <code>any</code> declarations</strong></p>

<p>Try to use <code>any</code> as less as possible. TypeScript encourages types and Angular framework is designed in the way that you need <code>any</code> only in case you interact with third party JS libs. </p>

<li><p>UDP is not reliable. The packet sent to the sever could be lost (and therefore the server will not answer). The packet sent by the server could be lost. The client must handle such possibilities. As coded, it just hangs in <code>recvfrom</code> indefinitely.</p></li>
<li><p>Your <code>recvfrom</code> only takes 1024 bytes. If the shell output is longer, the rest is irrecoverably lost.</p></li>
<li><p>If the shell output is longer than MTU, the output is fragmented into the multiple packets. The client however only reads one. From this point down, the data client receives have no connection to what was executed. Try to <code>cat</code> a long file, for example.</p>

<p>Also keep in mind that the fragments may arrive in any order (UDP doesn't guarantee the order of delivery).</p></li>
<li><p>Beware shell builtins. Since each command is executed in an individual shell, some commands (such as <code>cd</code>) only appear to be executed, but in fact have no effect.</p></li>
<li><p>Of course, don't ever run this server publicly. Execution of arbitrary commands (especially from an untrusted source) is a recipe for disaster.</p></li>

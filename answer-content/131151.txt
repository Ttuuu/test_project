<p>If I may ask, exactly how does your program end. I dont see any exit point for this code. I ran it and it kept asking me the four choices.</p>

<p>Also if you are only performing simple arithmetic operations, you can do so with a much lesser code than this.</p>

<p>There is a lot of duplicate code. For eg. You are getting the numbers each time for each operation. Why not just get them once from main and then work on them? </p>

<p>I've written my  version that pretty much attains the same. I've also commented some thoughts between your existing code and mine. I've kept your input fields but made them private. Other stuff is explained in code</p>

<pre><code>import java.util.Scanner;
//import java.math.*;//you have not used this anywhere.

    public class Calc{ // opening the bracket on the same line saves linespace, but it's a matter of opinion.

        static Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);// Scanner is final, no need to declare it as final. 
        //public static double answer;//not needed as you are operating on new values every time.
        private double firstNumber;//In your code this is static. Why static when you are obtaining it for every operation??
        private double secondNumber; //why is it static in your code??

        public Calc(){// initializes the two numbers.

   // When you add more though, I recommend using functions like you have done.*/

<p>It's still rough here and there. It would be better with more functionality as well. Hope this clears some stuff for you. Keep trying.</p>

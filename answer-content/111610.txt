<p>Joe Wallis gave some very good ideas for improvement, but even if you didn't at all change how it worked, you have a very long messy ternary. There's so much packed in there it's confusing. Splitting it into <code>if else</code> will read as a lot clearer.</p>

<pre><code>def convert_to_24(time):
    """str -&gt; str
    converts 12 hours time format to 24 hours
    """

    if time[-2:] == "AM":
        return time[:-2]
    else:
        return str(int(time[:2]) + 12) + time[2:8]
</code></pre>

<p>Now it's a lot easier to see what ending with "AM" means and how you're handling "PM".</p>

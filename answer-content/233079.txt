<p>Many of the commands in the script only make sense if the previous commands were successful.  But there's no checking.</p>

<p>The simple way to get much of that checking for free, is to set the shell's <strong>exit on error</strong> flag:</p>

<pre><code>set -e
</code></pre>

<p>I also recommend setting <strong>error on undefined</strong> to help pick up mistyped variable names:</p>

<pre><code>set -eu
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure you understand the power and limitations of these options; in particular, it's important to know the contexts where failing commands won't cause the script to exit.</p>

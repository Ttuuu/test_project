<h2>Spelling</h2>

<p>"Suite" is not the same as "Suit". A suit would be Hearts, Clubs, Spades and Diamonds.</p>

<h2>Logic Checking</h2>

<ul>
<li>Why is MAXCARDS 25? In Blackjack, the most cards a player is allowed is 5. Even then, the target is 21; with a standard deck of cards, that would be 4 Twos (8), 3 Threes (9) and 4 Aces (4). If you are planning on playing with more than 1 deck, then you can adjust the numbers as necessary, but the game is supposed to stop dealing cards to a player once 5 cards are there.</li>
<li>I don't see the logic for handling cards and their values. I assume that's in your Github link (Sorry, I didn't follow it). Ensure that Aces are treated as both 11 and 1 - when I do blackjack, I treat them as 11 until the player busts, then convert to a value of 1, and re-run the check.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Code Style</h2>

<ul>
<li><code>void print_hand(Hand player_hand);</code> would indicate to me that ONLY the <code>player_hand</code> would be passed through here, but you also pass the dealer's hand through this function. Good, you aren't repeating yourself - but I suggest changing it to <code>Hand hand</code> to indicate that it will run the check on any valid <code>Hand</code> that gets passed to it</li>
</ul>

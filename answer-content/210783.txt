<p>It is difficult to add anything to the existing great and detailed answers, but, to follow up your comment that <code>.__doc__</code> might be to difficult to remember for newcomers, you could then <em>wrap it around your custom function</em>:</p>
<pre><code>def doc(obj):
    """Prints a docstring of a given object."""
    print(obj.__doc__)
</code></pre>
<p>Usage:</p>
<pre><code>In [2]: class CARROT:
   ...:     """  instantiate with c = CARROT(project, name)
   ...:   change thread with c.change_thread_value(new_value)"""
   ...:     

In [3]: carrot = CARROT()

In [4]: doc(carrot)
  instantiate with c = CARROT(project, name)
  change thread with c.change_thread_value(new_value)
</code></pre>

<h3>Jupyter Notebooks?</h3>
<p>As a side note, you may switch to using <a href="https://jupyter.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Jupyter notebooks</a> that may actually be a good learning environment for newcomers and would let them use the standard built-in <code>help()</code> in the Jupyter cells.</p>
<p>There are also built-in shortcuts, like <code>shift+TAB</code> to access a help popup:</p>

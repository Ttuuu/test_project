<p>I believe if you want to write "cleaner looking" code you could implement a hashtable.</p>

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/4384446/1575353">This answer goes over how to create a hashtable</a>.</p>

<p>I think for your purposes it might be a little bit overkill, since your data set is limited. There's nothing wrong with having <code>if</code>-<code>else</code> inside your <code>switch</code> statements. One thing you could change is instead of adding</p>

<pre><code>frequency = a4Frequency / pow(2, (numOfSemitones / 12));
</code></pre>

<p>in multiple places, having one line that handles the frequency calculation for all cases. You can accomplish this by checking the values of <code>numOfSemitones</code> and <code>frequency</code> against their initialized values after your code goes through the <code>switch</code> statement with</p>

<pre><code>if (numOfSemitones != 0 &amp;&amp; frequency != 0.0)  
/* Assuming we don't care if there is no frequency 
since we're calculating a present note */
{
    frequency = a4Frequency / pow(2, (numOfSemitones / 12));
}
else
{
    /* We did something wrong, throw an exception */ 
}
</code></pre>

<p>Since the A and B notes' frequencies are handled differently, I would recommend returning those via the <code>switch</code> statement, as you do with the base frequency of A4.</p>

<p>Additionally you could add more error checking with a default case, as well as checking the length of the note string and if the <code>note[0]</code> is a valid note letter.</p>

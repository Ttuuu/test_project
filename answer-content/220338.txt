<p>Storing properties of <code>grid</code>, which is a method parameter, into instance fields m and n, is bad practise. Now the reader has to wonder why their scope is exposed outside the method. M and n should stay in the same scope (they should be method variables).</p>

<p><code>M</code> and <code>n</code> are bad names for <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>. There's nothing wrong with width and height and these would communicate their intended purpose immediately.</p>

<p>While <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> are common loop index variables, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are more commonly used for indexing a two dimensional grid. Some people use <code>row</code> and <code>col</code>, which are fine too.</p>

<p>While scanning every element is clean and works well for small input, you could just find the first element that has a "coastline" and check it's neighbors, ignoring all elements that don't have a "coastline". Follow the coastline clockwise and stop once you reach the first element again.</p>

<p>Looks OK to me, without knowing Transact SQL anyway. Some things to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>obviously this implements just HMAC-SHA256, so the function should be named that way;</li>
<li>the key parameters is 8000 <code>varbinary</code> max value. That seems largish to me (although it might not matter much as the size is variable anyway);</li>
<li>there is no way to perform a hash over multiple fields in the DB which might be a use case (no incremental update possibility);</li>
<li>similarly, often it is required to reuse the key for multiple calculations, in that case you can cache the <code>Pads.i</code> and <code>Pads.o</code> values.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm also missing some constants being introduced but that might be due to the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/26652/589259">nature of TSQL</a>.</p>

<p>Don't forget to test against NIST test vectors, just to be sure.</p>

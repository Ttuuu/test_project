<p>Make use of this small project to separate core logic from UI. You can have a class <code>Calculator</code> which retains current state, and your UI is just a way to display this class.</p>

<p>To do this, just think your design as if you were to replace UI by CLI. You have to be able to unplug your UI, plug CLI, and your calculator has to work the same. This is also, I think, an easier way to write unit tests or run batch functional tests.</p>

<p>It mainly concerns <code>doMath</code> and <code>convertValue</code>, which has nothing to do in UI code. Actually <code>convertValue</code> might disappear even in a <code>Calculator</code> class, because you will have the real value stored.</p>

<li>I would remove <code>max_val</code> from your code, doing so removes an if-statement as well as a variable. </li>
<li><code>li[i] = li[i] + 1</code> is the same as <code>li[i] += 1</code>, but I prefer the second (my teacher told me it's faster) and I think it reads nicer, same goes for <code>i = i - 1</code></li>
<li><p>I agree with the point raised by @rbanffy that <code>li</code> should be called <code>counters</code>.</p>

<pre><code>def solution(N, A):
    counters = [0] * N

    for i in A:
        i -= 1
        if i == N:
            counters = [max(counters)] * N
        else:
            counters[i] += 1

    return counters
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>As this is part of coding challenge and not actual code that will be used more regularly I don't think it's an issue that errors, such as one of the inputs being a string, are not taken care of. For the same reason I do not think comments are that important.</p>

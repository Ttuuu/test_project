<p>A few comments on this...</p>

<p><em>What is a character?</em> In your code, you are only counting non-spaces as characters. But, if the user enters <code>a        a</code> that counts as 10 characters to me.....</p>

<p>From my perspective, Characters can just be <code>text.length</code>.</p>

<p>Still your definition appears to be 'non-space characters'. Using that definition....</p>

<p>Now, about the regex. You describe 2 ways to count words, and one way to count non-space characters, and then, for some odd reason, you count newlines as well.</p>

<p>So, if I were to suggest that the best way to do it was with just one big, and few small regex... ? The big regex is the most complicated to run because it needs to do more complicated matching on a larger value. By stripping the value sooner, you can make it faster.</p>

<p>Note, you do not need the <code>\b</code> word boundary markers when dealing with either <code>\s+</code> or <code>\S+</code>.</p>

<pre><code>//Function declaration, will be hoisted for 'addEventListener'
//Most of the work is done to have this work for multiple text area's
function updateStatus(){

  var text = this.value,
      // replace all words with an x
      xWords = text.replace(/\S+/g, "x"),
      //Replace those x's
      noWords = xWords.replace(/x/g, ""),
      //Get rid of newlines from just the spaces.
      noNewLines = noWords.replace(/\n/g, "");
  //You could consider a template function here..
  statusBar.textContent = "Length: " + text.length +
                          " Words: " + (xWords.length - noWords.length) +
                          " Characters: " + (text.length - noWords.length) +
                          " / " + (noWords.length - noNewLines.length);  
}
</code></pre>

<p>The above creates successively smaller string values, and compares the difference in length to compute the result....</p>

<p>Sometimes Plan C is the better option.</p>

<p>With the help of Konijn we/I have put together this jsfiddle <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/RD49Y/" rel="nofollow">which shows it in operation</a>.</p>

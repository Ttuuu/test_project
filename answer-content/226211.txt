<h3>Review</h3>

<ul>
<li>There is no added value in creating a new <code>Random</code> for every cycle in the loop. Create and reuse a single instance.</li>
<li>You have a convoluted way of generating the next random value. Why do <code>r.nextInt((9 - 1) + 1)</code> + 1 when <code>r.nextInt(9)</code> + 1 would yield the same? If it's a readability thing, the latter is better.</li>
<li>I agree with other answer that if you want <em>unique</em> numbers, you should not naively generate random segments. Instead, use incrementing sequences or encode parts of the key fields of a user in the id.</li>
</ul>

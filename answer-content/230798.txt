<p>Overall, this looks pretty good. If it were me, I'd use a more descriptive name for the top of the stack such as <code>topOfStack</code> or just <code>top</code>. <code>tos</code> doesn't really mean anything, so without a comment describing it, I would be confused seeing that in code. (And if you need to write a comment to explain a variable name, you've probably named it incorrectly.)</p>

<p>I'm not sure your <code>set()</code> method works correctly. From the description it sounds like it shouldn't take any arguments and should set <code>tos</code> to 0. But it's possible I misunderstood. If you set the top to some passed-in value, then you have a bunch of junk on the stack between its previous value and the current value, which probably isn't what you want.</p>

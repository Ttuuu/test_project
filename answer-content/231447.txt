<p>The question here is, as I see it, what are you trying to accomplish?
Do you want to make the JavaScript more readable; focus on the JavaScript, do you want to organize these files better; focus on organizing the JavaScript and how it's passed to the frontend.</p>

<p>Looking to myself, I would move the JavaScript scripts to a JavaScript file and reference them in your scripts stack. That way you can organize the JavaScript on the JavaScript side and keep your blade views clean</p>

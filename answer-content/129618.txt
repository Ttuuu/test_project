<p>First of all I see really nice approaches in naming your artefacts (classes, methods, parameters, vars). Furthermore you master the first step of programming: algorithmic thinking. As you have thought of naming you figured out most responsibilities so you followed the single responsibility principle.</p>
<p>Yes, there are some things to improve. But I see only one real big issue: the intention to implement hashcode and equals.</p>
<h1>Hashcode and equals</h1>
<p>I'd like to address hashcode and equals as there are intentions to implement them. If you do so you may have strange effects in the future. You can easily see what happens if your equals and hashcode methods base on length and width (and I guess it will) of your Chocolate:</p>
<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    Set&lt;Chocolate&gt; set = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();
    Chocolate chocolate = new Chocolate(4, 8);
    set.add(chocolate);
    System.out.println(set.contains(chocolate)); // --&gt; true
    chocolate.numberOfBlocksOfTheLargestSquareThatCanbeFormedFromTheChocolate();
    System.out.println(set.contains(chocolate)); // --&gt; false
    
}
</code></pre>
<p>As length and/or width will mutate in the method "numberOfBlocksOfTheLargest..." a Chocolate cannot be found anymore within hash-based collections like Set or Map. Currently you aren't facing the problem because you only iterate over all elements that are within the Set and no hash-related operation is performed there.</p>
<p>Equals and hashcode should only base on immutable values. In this easy example you may get over it. In real applications you will face serious problems. In one of the projects I was in I saw objects occasionally diappearing during a serialization process. Objects that were available on a rich-client were not available anymore once they were sent over the network through serializing and deserializing. The problem was a weak implementation of equals and hashcode. They based on mutable values.</p>
<p>The only way your hashcode-method can be implemented without having these side-effects: return -1; (or any other constant). But this will hack the intention of hashcode as your performance of your contains()-method will be linear to the amount of objects the Set contains.</p>
<h1>Naming</h1>
<p>input1, input2, input3, ... you can do better ;-)</p>
<p>Your task was to simulate chocolate distribution. So why not changing the class name from "CodeCandidate" to ChocolateDistribution.</p>
<h1>Multiple return statements</h1>
<p>Try to use only one return statement per method. If you do that you can easily apply refactorings on it like extract method.</p>
<h1>Code location</h1>
<p>I would pass the chocolate carton into "ChocolateDistribution" instead of creating it inside.</p>
<h1>Recursive algorithm</h1>
<p>As the problem has a recursive nature I'd prefere a recursive solution. But that's only an opinion.</p>
<h1>Privacy</h1>
<p>length and width should be private.</p>
<h1>Code</h1>
<p>Here is the code resulting on my suggestions:</p>
<pre><code>public class ChocolateDistribution {


    public int getTotalNumberofChildrenThatCanBeFed(Set&lt;Chocolate&gt; chocolateCarton){
        
        int totalNumberOfChildrenThatCanBeFed = 0;
        
        for (Chocolate chocolate : chocolateCarton) {
            int childrenFedFromTheChocolate = chocolate.getSquareChocolates().size();
            totalNumberOfChildrenThatCanBeFed+=childrenFedFromTheChocolate;
        }
        
        return totalNumberOfChildrenThatCanBeFed;
    }

    
}

class Chocolate {

    private int length;
    private int width;

    
    public Chocolate(int length,int width){
        this.length=length;
        this.width=width;
    }
    
    
    public Set&lt;Chocolate&gt; getSquareChocolates() {
        
        Set&lt;Chocolate&gt; chocolates = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();
        
        if (this.width &gt; this.length) {
            int width = this.width - this.length;
            chocolates.add(new Chocolate(this.length, this.length));
            chocolates.addAll(new Chocolate(this.length, width).getSquareChocolates());
        } else if (this.length &gt; this.width) {
            int length = this.length - this.width;
            chocolates.add(new Chocolate(this.width, this.width));
            chocolates.addAll(new Chocolate(length, this.width).getSquareChocolates());
        } else { // this.length == this.width
            chocolates.add(this);
        }
        
        return chocolates;
    }

}

<h2>Code in Action</h2>
<pre><code>public class Main {


    public static void main(String[] args) {
    
        Set&lt;Chocolate&gt; chocolateCarton = createChocolateCarton(5, 6, 3, 4);
        
        ChocolateDistribution chocolateDistribution = new ChocolateDistribution();
        
        System.out.println(chocolateDistribution.getTotalNumberofChildrenThatCanBeFed(chocolateCarton));
        
    }
    

    private static Set&lt;Chocolate&gt; createChocolateCarton(int lengthFrom, int lengthTo, int widthFrom, int widthTo){
        
        int[] lengthLimits = {lengthFrom,lengthTo};
        int[] widthLimits = {widthFrom,widthTo};
        
        Set&lt;Chocolate&gt; chocolates = new HashSet&lt;Chocolate&gt;();
        
        for(int i=0;i&lt;lengthLimits.length;i++){
            for(int j=0;j&lt;widthLimits.length;j++){
                Chocolate rectangle = new Chocolate(lengthLimits[i], widthLimits[j]);
                chocolates.add(rectangle);
            }
        }
        
        return chocolates;
    }

<h1>Finally</h1>
<p>... there is no necessity to implement equals and hashcode.</p>

<p>There are many ways to go about it using different models of abstraction, using functions (<a href="https://www.codementor.io/kaushikpal/user-defined-functions-in-python-8s7wyc8k2" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>) for example:</p>

<pre><code>def functionname(parameters):
    stuff_to_happen
</code></pre>

<p>You should pass in data to the functions as parameters. You need to give the functions the data structure holding the track info so that they can do what they need.</p>

<p>You could also use objected oriented programming. Try to make a class called <code>TrackManager</code>. A class can have functions and data that the class attributes can access.</p>

<p>Then you just call the functions in appropriate order.</p>

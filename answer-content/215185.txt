<p>I'm concerned that <code>make-suffix</code> is sufficiently general that we'll have name collisions with other packages - or even new Emacs versions.  Perhaps prefix with some tag (I tend to begin names with my initials to disambiguate my own functions, for example; that would give you something like <code>an/make-suffix</code>).</p>

<p>Instead of binding a lambda to the keystroke, prefer to give it a name.  That makes it easier to bind to other keys (perhaps interactively) and for <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>h</kbd> <kbd>k</kbd> to give the best output.</p>

<p>Talking of which, let's have some docstrings, please!</p>

<p>Finally, since the function will work only on writable buffers, we should have <strong><code>(interactive "*")</code></strong> to avoid wasting effort when used in a read-only context.</p>

<p>Your code looks fine, however to improve it, you should use a proper test system like pytest or unittest. To demonstrate, here is your code when using pytest, and making the test proper (you don't need to test every specific item:</p>

<pre><code>def flatten(input_array):
    result_array = []
    for element in input_array:
        if isinstance(element, int):
            result_array.append(element)
        elif isinstance(element, list):
            result_array += flatten(element)
    return result_array


def test01():
    results = flatten([1, [2, 3, [4]], 5, [[6]]])
    assert results == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]


def test02():
    results = flatten([1, [2, 3, [4], []], [], 5, [[], [6]]])
    assert results == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
</code></pre>

<p>And here are the results:</p>

<pre><code>C:\PycharmProjects\codereview\tests&gt;pytest scratch_14.py 
======================== test session starts ========================

===================== 2 passed in 0.09 seconds ======================
</code></pre>

<p>This is much easier to set up, and less code to write to validate if the solution is correct.
You asked: Is usage of TypeError exception justified?<br>
I don't actually see any code referencing a type error. Did you forget to put it in? Or are you referring to the use of isinstance? If so, that code is fine.<br>
Hope this helps!</p>

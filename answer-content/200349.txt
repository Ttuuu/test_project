<p>Several <em>comments</em> are unnecessary:</p>

<pre><code>    // Loop over the array
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; array.length; i++) {

    // assign second highest element to highest element
    secondHighest = highest;
</code></pre>

<p>I recommend do use braces <code>{ ... }</code> for all if-blocks, even if that
consists only of a single statement, and definitely if there is
an additional comment line:</p>

<pre><code>        } else if (array[i] &gt; secondHighest)
            // Just replace the second highest
            secondHighest = array[i];
</code></pre>

<p>Iteration over all array elements can be simplified with an
“enhanced for loop:”</p>

<pre><code>    for (int elem : array) {
        // ...
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Your function returns <code>Integer.MIN_VALUE</code> for an empty or single-element
array, which is fine if specified as such. An alternative would be
to throw an exception for arrays with less than two elements.</p>

<p>With respect to performance, I doubt there is much to improve.
The function iterates once over all array elements, which looks pretty
much optimal.</p>

<p>One other major and easy improvement is to notice that factors come in pairs: if <code>a%n==0</code>, than <code>(n/a)%n==0</code>. Thus you only need to look for factors less that <code>n**.5+1</code>. Here's how the factor sum code looks now:</p>

<pre><code>def factor(c):
    total = 1
    for d in range(2, int(c**.5 + 1)):
        if c % d == 0:
            total += d
            if c//d &gt; d:
                total += (c//d)
    return total
</code></pre>

<p>note that by <code>n=10_000</code>, this loop only has <code>100</code> iteration, compared to <code>5000</code> before. That's a roughly 50x speedup. For another factor of 2 speedup, notice that a,b is amicable if and only if b,a is amicable, so you can start the b loop at the value of a+1</p>

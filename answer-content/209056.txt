<p>Henrik already said much of what I wanted to say, but here's what I'd like to add:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's good to see documentation! I would still add a brief description to each class though.</li>
<li>Instead of <code>#if DEBUG</code> directives, you could write a <code>void ThrowIfNull</code> method and mark it with a <code>[Conditional("DEBUG")]</code> attribute.</li>
<li>I would let <code>IndexShuffler</code> accept a <code>Random</code> instance via its constructor. This allows for deterministic behavior (passing a <code>Random</code> with a specific seed), which can be useful for testing and for specific use-cases.</li>
<li>Note that, when wrapping, it's possible to get the same item twice in a row. That may not be a problem, but it's something to be aware of.</li>
<li>Why are <code>Remaining</code> and <code>Max</code> methods instead of properties? Why isn't <code>Max</code> named <code>Count</code>?</li>
</ul>
    </div>

<p>Your basic approach looks good.  However I noticed a few things:</p>

<p>You're not checking for strings with 0 characters.</p>

<p>The ternary statement adjusting for odd or even length is unnecessary.  Simply dividing by 2 and adding 1 will work for both odd or even lengths.</p>

<p>Inside the loop, you're calling <code>toLower()</code> twice on each iteration.  This is quite inefficient.  Storing the word converted to lower case in a variable and using that instead of the passed string would be much more efficient.</p>

<p>When testing for inequality it is usually better to use the inequality operator(<code>!=</code>) instead of not(!) and equals(==).  It's more concise and easier to read.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind that this post is more than seven years old, there are <a href="https://codereview.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1510/120114">zombies</a> I should be spending my time on instead of this, and you have likely learned much about JavaScript since then(<strong>Edit</strong>: it appears you have a gold badge for JS on SO so it seems like you <em>have</em> learned a lot), there is something that I feel should be mentioned that hasn't already.... For posterity. </p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.thecodeship.com/web-development/methods-within-constructor-vs-prototype-in-javascript/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this post</a> explains, the methods should be declared on the prototypes instead of in the constructor functions. That way the memory usage will be dramatically less. </p>

<p>Take for example the constructor function for <code>Player</code> - it can be simplified to the following, with the variables declared inside set on <code>this</code>.</p>

<pre><code>var Player = function(pitcher, name) {
    this.name = (name == undefined) ? "Nothing" : name;
    this.balls = 0;
    this.strikes = 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then add the methods on the prototype:</p>

<pre><code>Player.prototype.getName = function() {
    return this.name;
}
Player.prototype.atBat = function() {
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>While there are only two <code>Player</code> objects it would still be beneficial to do this, in order to reduce memory consumption.</p>

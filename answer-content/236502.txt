<p>There are several ways to improve this code:</p>

<ol>
<li>Commenting. Please add some comments to your code so other people can understand it easily. It might not be a "coding" suggestion but it is as important as writing a good code.</li>
<li>Classes declaration location. It is not usual to declare the classes inside the main loop area. You can declare them outside, maybe even in another file.</li>
<li>Use meaningful variables names. </li>
<li>Use type annotations. To make the code faster and more readable.</li>
<li>Remove redundant class. Class <code>S</code> is redundant and should probably be removed since it has no real functionality.</li>
<li>Create a general class. All of your classes can inherit from a general <code>shape</code> class and override the <code>area</code> method.</li>
<li>Remove redundant parentheses. Remove redundant parentheses in the classes declarations.</li>
<li>Use <code>fstring</code> while printing.</li>
<li>Do not write code in <code>main</code>. Create a function that <code>__main__</code> will call so none of your variables will be global.</li>
</ol>

<p>As said there are several ways to improve this code. All of them are suggestion and you do not have to implement any of them. This is a functioning and understandable code as is.</p>

<p>I know you asked us to rate your code, but I will not :)<br>
Keep programing!</p>

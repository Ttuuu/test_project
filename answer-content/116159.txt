<p>I just wanted to offer an alternative answer to your implementation that I discovered after trying to come up with a cool way to do Euler's #2.</p>

<p>The algorithm uses an equation I discovered: Fib(x+3) = 4*Fib(x) + Fib(x-3) (this works for x &gt; 3, otherwise assume Fib(x-3) is 0).</p>

<p>Due to the nature of the fibonacci sequence we know that every 3rd fibonacci number is even. The equation above only uses every 3rd fibonacci, which means we can calculate all even fibonacci numbers without calculating the odds one at all.</p>

<p>Here's the code: </p>

<pre><code>int fib = 2, sum = 0, holder = 0;
while (fib &lt; 4000000)
{
    sum += fib;
    int swapper = fib;
    fib = 4 * fib + holder;
    holder = swapper;
}
</code></pre>

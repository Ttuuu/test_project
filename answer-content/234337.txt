<p>This is a case where your algorithm needs help. There are 3 cases to consider: only 1 nonzero digit, 1 less than a power of 10, and everything else.</p>

<ol>
<li><code>a*10^n</code> goes to <code>10^(n+1)+(a-1)</code></li>
<li><code>10^n - 1</code> goes to <code>10^n + 10^n - 10^(n-1)</code></li>
<li>Otherwise, increase the 2nd least significant non-zero by 1, and decrease the last nonzero by 1.</li>
</ol>

<p>This algorithm will run in linear time to the number of digits in <code>n</code> (as opposed to yours which is exponential).</p>

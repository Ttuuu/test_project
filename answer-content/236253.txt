<p>You use several times the result[0].ToString(). Store it if you need it several times.</p>

<p>The 3 variables in the beginning result in, those variables are computed, also when their value is not used. If you do not use these variables, but put the "Contains" evaluation directly in place, they would be only evaluated, when needed.</p>

<p>The last 'If' has no else before. That means it might be possible, a formerly set StatusResult will be overriden.</p>

<p>StatusResult is not always set, I'm not sure there is always at least one path taken.</p>

<p>You could create the ResultObject in the beginning, and store the member values directly, instead of first in local variables, and then copy the local variables. That's minor, cause it's fast, but more lines make the code less readable.</p>

<p>You really distinguish "OK" and "KO" ? You play tricks on everyone's brain. As more similar words are, as more easy they are mixed up by people. This comment is different from the other answer. I do not try to understand the meaning.</p>

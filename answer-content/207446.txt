<p>The method <code>free_list(list)</code> should internally use <code>clear(list)</code>, instead of duplicating the code for clearing the list.</p>

<p>The method <code>clear(list)</code> should not use <code>pop_back(list)</code>, which does a lot of checks and pointer assignments, which are discarded by the next <code>pop_back()</code> call. Instead, maintain a local variable and loop over the list and free the nodes directly.  Then, unconditional set head &amp; tail to NULL.  Eg:</p>

<pre><code>void clear(List list) {
    pnode curr = list-&gt;head;
    while (curr) {
        pnode temp = curr;
        curr = curr-&gt;next;
        free(temp);
    }
    list-&gt;head = NULL;
    list-&gt;tail = NULL;
}
</code></pre>
    </div>

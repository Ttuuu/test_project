<p>Nice code, clearly written.</p>

<p>I understand the rate limiting requirement.
Having the <code>drain()</code> call within the loop doesn't seem like the caller's responsibility, better to let the BG callback handle it, or defer until <code>finish()</code> as written, which does make sense. Each url fetch could take more or less than the delay time. So this seems to be a bug / wart still lurking within the code.</p>

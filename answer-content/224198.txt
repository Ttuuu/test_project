<p>The main thing that tends to take time in acting over the net is the wait time between sending a request and getting a response, as opposed to the actual computations you have to do during the processing. It is therefore much more important to have a highly concurrent implementation than optimizing for parralel processing. In your case I would either increase the amount of threads in the pool to be the same length as as the number of pages to load, or use a concurrency library instead of a paralization library, especially if the thread library starts to have some kind of problems with such a high amount of threads (as they might have higher overhead).</p>

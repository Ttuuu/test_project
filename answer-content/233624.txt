<p><strong>String Operations</strong></p>

<p>You're copying a string and then starting to make various transformations to it. As <code>std::isspace</code> and <code>std::tolower</code> end up being called and can have quite complex logic, avoiding them (and using plain for/if) can bring a significant improvement to this part, especially if you are only interested in ASCII.</p>

<p><strong>Server-side VS client-side processing</strong></p>

<p>Have you tried writing the code so that it runs inside the database server? Passing all this data around is costly. </p>

<p>Have you tried other database technologies that might offer good enough performance using simple queries?</p>

<p><strong>Use case</strong></p>

<p>As we're talking about milliseconds, isn't it enough to just run the query in the database? Will the statistics be computed often (e.g. every time a page is openned)? If so, computing them differently (say an update when a change occurs) might make more sense.</p>

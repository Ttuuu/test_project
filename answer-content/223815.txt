<p>First impressions: nicely presented code; good use of the appropriate standard library functions and classes.</p>

<p>A minor suggestion would be to change the name, given that <code>reduce</code> is a well-known concept in functional programming (and is a function in <code>&lt;numeric&gt;</code>).  Perhaps call it <code>compress</code>?</p>

<p>I'd suggest extracting the constant <code>3</code> to give it a meaningful name.</p>

<p>Can we eliminate the <code>break</code> with some reorganisation of the loop?  Perhaps by using <code>std::mismatch(it, it+1)</code> instead of <code>std::adjacent_find()</code>?  (I haven't fully thought that through; it might not be better.)</p>

<p>We can avoid constructing a new string here:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>        result += std::string(dist, *it);
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>by using the overload of <code>append()</code> that takes two iterators:</p>

<pre><code>        result.append(dist, *it);
</code></pre>

<p>Not a thorough review, but two things jump out at me as problematic with <code>ImmutableQueue</code>:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Your <code>Reverse</code> method looks wrong: it doesn't do anything if <code>front</code> isn't empty, and doesn't reverse if it isn't. I would have expected:</p>

<pre><code>let reverse () = 
    ImmutableQueue(rear, front)
</code></pre>

<p>There are no tests for this method.</p></li>
<li><p>Some of the methods of <code>ImmutableQueue</code> seem to assume that the queue is empty if <code>front</code> is empty, while others do not. Without looking too carefully, I think <code>front</code> can never be empty if the whole thing isn't, but this isn't documented, and it's all rather confusing.</p>

<p><code>Enqueue</code>, for example, will happily handle <code>front = []</code>, while <code>tryPeek</code> returns <code>None</code> if <code>front = []</code>, and <code>tryDequeue</code> is careful to make sure it doesn't produce an <code>ImmutableQueue</code> where <code>front = []</code>.</p></li>
</ol>

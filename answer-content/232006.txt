<p>In addition to what RootTwo already mentioned, I would also advise to:</p>

<h1>Define all class attributes in <code>__init__</code></h1>

<p>When I want to understand a new class, the first things that I look at are its methods and its attributes. These are luckily already <strong>well-named</strong>, so I get an intuitive understanding of what they mean.</p>

<p>However, your attributes are <strong>spread out</strong> over your class. I need to read through all the code to even see how many attributes there are. This problem will also be picked up by some linters, as discussed in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19284857/instance-attribute-attribute-name-defined-outside-init#19292653">this post</a>. 
The answers already suggest two solutions (<em>slightly adapted here)</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You may still want to split initialization into other methods though. In such case, you can simply assign attributes to None (with a bit of documentation) in the <strong>init</strong> then call the sub-initialization methods.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just return an value(or tuple of values) and unpack into attributes inside <strong>init</strong> as needed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whatever you use is up to you, but personally I prefer the second option, since that makes it more obvious when reading the <code>__init__</code> that a value is set (to follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment" rel="nofollow noreferrer">POSA</a>).</p>

<p>In this case, you might argue that this requires a large amount of typing and variable assignments. However, this leads me to the second point:</p>

<h1>Try to refactor some attributes</h1>

<p>You have a very large number of attributes, of which a lot seem closely related. This is more natural when dealing with GUI stuff, but I would still try to organize some of them in data structures such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dictionaries</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/dataclasses.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Dataclasses</a> (if your version of Python allows it)</li>
</ul>

<p>This will also make it much easier to reuse and update portions of your code, since it exactly defines what should minimally be initialized.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Side Note:</h2>

<p>Defining all variables in <code>__init__</code> might feel as boilerplate code. In some situations using the <a href="https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">attrs</a> package can reduce this work. It also comes with some nice benefits such as providing a nice automated string <code>repr</code> and comparison methods for your classes.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if it is perfect for this situation, but I find it a handy tool to know about, that can make some classes a lot clearer.</p>

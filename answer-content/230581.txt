<p>There are two general approaches.</p>

<h1>The first is to use image, and modify as you see fit.</h1>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ol>
<li>Simple to use.</li>
<li>Can be easily applied to all shapes.</li>
<li>Reliable.</li>
<li>There might already be a free suitable implementation you can use.</li>
</ol>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ol>
<li>Fixed limited accuracy.</li>
<li>You might need to implement a GPU or SIMD based code to achieve required performance.</li>
<li>Requires too much resources for trivial cases.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Second approach: use polygons.</h1>

<p>There is a simple formula to compute area of a polygon.</p>

<p>Say, you have a polygon <code>{(x_1, y_1)...(x_n, y_n)}</code> then its area is the sum</p>

<pre><code>(x_2-x_1)*(y_1+y_2)/2 + ... + (x_1-x_n)*(y_n+y_1)/2
// technically, it equals to either area or -area depending on orientation of the polygon
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that union/intersection of polygons is not, in general, a polygon - instead, it can be expressed as a union of non-intersecting polygons. But then after repeated use number of polygons might blow up depending on input... so utilizing this method requires care and attention, though in your case it might be quite simple.</p>

<p>It is harder to apply this method for all shapes: you ought to approximate the shape via a polygon.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: suitable for both approaches. Since your grid is regular, <em>under a mild additional assumption</em>, computation of Total Area can be to simplified to computation of area of a few pieces of it.</p>

<ol>
<li>Area in a cell of the grid. (A)</li>
<li>4 types of areas that lie on the sides of the grid. (B1,B2,B3,B4)</li>
<li>Remaining corner area - 4 regions at the corners. (C = C1+C2+C3+C4, it is the area of the base shape).</li>
</ol>

<p>See <a href="https://imgur.com/a/1Azo4us" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://imgur.com/a/1Azo4us</a> for clarification. In the image I showed only two types of side areas and one corner area - there are also two types of side area on the other side of the grid.</p>

<p>Total Area is <code>C + (B1+B3)*(Rows-1) + (B2+B4)*(Cols-1) + A*(Rows-1)*(Cols-1)</code></p>

<p>Though, this simplification works only if the base shape is fully contained its four neighbor cells... if it is not the case the formula becomes more complicated.</p>

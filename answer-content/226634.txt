<p>There's a potential bug with this scenario.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4737875/exception-in-static-constructor">this Jon Skeet post</a>, if an exception is thrown inside the <code>static</code> constructor, it is never retried. Which means that if your Singleton initialization has a problem, your Singleton is doomed for the lifetime of your application, which normally isn't a problem with the "traditional" way of doing it.</p>

<p>Fun question, the bounty should obviously go to deain.</p>

<p>Nobody seemed to have noticed the fact that <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are globals. </p>

<p>Other than that I would use a <code>line</code> function (a bit slower, but more intuitive to read) to the line drawing.</p>

<pre><code>//Draw the line on the context, caller needs to worry about `stroke()`
function pencilLine( ctx, fromX, fromY, toX, toY ){
  ctx.moveTo( fromX, fromY );
  ctx.lineTo( toX, toY );
}
</code></pre>

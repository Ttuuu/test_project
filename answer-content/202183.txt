<p>Nice question! This is a great demonstration of opposing design aesthetics.</p>

<p>I definitely prefer the first one. It is straightforward to read and does what it says. The story is clear. I'd prefer that the function didn't modify process.env directly as part of the loop (see <code>toOverwriteProcessEnv</code>), but it's all small gripe and not a big deal.</p>

<p>The second one has all these huge comments that make it hard (or impossible) to see the code all at once, and the constants actually make it harder to follow, forcing the readers eyes to jump around. Most of the flags look like "scope creep" to me... it's allowing a much more flexible file format than what 99% of the users will need. Is this a real requirement or speculation? A couple of the flags would be potentially useful, but I think I'd still prefer option #1.</p>

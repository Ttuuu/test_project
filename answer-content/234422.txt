<p>I find your php script incredibly hard to read.  Maintaining this script would surely involve substantial time investment.</p>

<p>You are conducting far too much <code>preg_</code> surgery on input that can be prepared to be valid html.  Processing html is far more reliable via a proper DOM parsing tool.  My preferred tool is DOMDocument and I often pair it with XPath when it makes node targeting clearer/simpler.</p>

<p>I don't have the time to completely rewrite your script, but that is precisely what I recommend.</p>

<p>You shouldn't ever need to perform "mopping up" of your generated html by throwing some more <code>&lt;/div&gt;</code> in at the end.</p>

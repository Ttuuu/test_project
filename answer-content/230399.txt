<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<ol>
<li><pre><code>SELECT Surname
FROM Employee
JOIN Department ON Department.Director = Employee.EmployeeId;
</code></pre>

<p>Other than not requiring a subquery, this is generally a better thing to do because you can then easily access the matching <code>Department</code> table if you ever need to select a column from it.</p></li>
<li><p>Are you sure that this even works? You aren't joining the employee's department to the department ID. This should likely be:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Surname, Salary, City
FROM Employee
JOIN Department ON Department.DepartmentId = Employee.DepartmentId
               AND Department.City = 'Haarlem';
</code></pre></li>
<li><pre><code>SELECT ProjectName, Budget, Surname
FROM Employee
JOIN Works ON Works.EmployeeId = Employee.EmployeeId
JOIN Project ON Project.ProjectId = Works.ProjectId
            AND Project.Budget &gt; 100;
</code></pre>

<p>This should be functionally equivalent but uses cleaner syntax.</p></li>
</ol>

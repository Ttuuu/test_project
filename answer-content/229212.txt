<p>Welcome to the wonderful land of computer programming!</p>

<p>There are a few things you could do that could help clean up that code. However, if this is for a class, I would recommend not to add functions, make sure the player is giving a valid safe input, and avoiding namespace issues for future development.</p>

<p>But if it is for a class, here are yet a few</p>

<ul>
<li>Where can nested loops be used?

<ul>
<li>The flow control for playing again could be reworked as the "no" test isn't needed because the output could be outside the loop.</li>
<li>Any goto statements make it difficult to read because we typically can't easily distinguish the difference as we can we code blocks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Using proper vernacular and grammar would increase your max audience by roughly 5%.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong><br>
I wanted to add, that after 2^32 + 1 runs of your program, you'll see that the computer has a slight bias towards 0. This is pretty common when using making computer AI choices with most random number generators. This is because the of the way the modulus operator works. 10 % 3 will have have a distribution of 4, 3, and 3. I wouldn't worry about it too much for Rock, Paper, Scissors (it's basically a 1:40,000,000,000,000,000) but it's something you should be made aware of.</p>

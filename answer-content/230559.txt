<p>The comment here</p>

<pre><code>int[] numbers = new int[nums.Length +2];  // we add 2 because of the question
</code></pre>

<p>is not really useful, it requires to read the entire question to figure out why 2 is added to the number of balloons. I would suggest something like</p>

<pre><code>// Allocate array for all balloons, plus the two "imaginary" balloons 
// at positions -1 and n.
</code></pre>

<p>which closely matches the note from the problem description:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You may imagine nums[-1] = nums[n] = 1. They are not real therefore you can not burst them.</p>

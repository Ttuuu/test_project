<p><code>numberOfStreaks</code> is a misleading variable name. You even managed to make @AJNeufeld <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/247971/219610">claim</a> that you're not checking <em>whether</em> a streak occurred but that you're <em>counting</em> the number of streaks (possibly <em>multiple</em> per experiment) and thus compute the wrong thing. But you stop at the first streak in each experiment, so you're doing the right thing. A better name would be <code>experiments_with_streak</code>, as that's what you're really counting.</p>
<p>As AJNeufeld pointed out, you misrepresent the result, showing about 0.8% instead of about 80%. Now the 80% means that most experiments have streaks. Probably on average somewhere in the middle. So it's wasteful to compute 100 tosses if you actually don't use the last few dozen. Also, you don't always need to follow the letter of the task (though that is advantageous for clarity) as long as you get the right result. In this case, instead of 100 tosses of heads/tails, you could look at 99 tosses of same/different (as the coin before). It can make the code a bit simpler. Only 99 because the first coin doesn't have one before.</p>
<p>Putting these observations into code (also incorporating some of AJNeufeld's points):</p>
<pre><code>import random

NUM_EXPERIMENTS = 10_000

experiments_with_streak = 0

for _ in range(NUM_EXPERIMENTS):
    streak = 0
    for _ in range(99):
        same = random.choice((True, False))
        streak = streak + 1 if same else 0
        if streak == 5:
            experiments_with_streak += 1
            break

print('Chance of streak: %.2f%%' % (100 * experiments_with_streak / NUM_EXPERIMENTS))
</code></pre>
<p>Finally let me have some fun with a <code>for</code>-loop-less solution that even allows me to use <code>statistics.mean</code> so I don't have to repeat the number of experiments:</p>
<pre><code>from random import choices
from statistics import mean

chance = mean('s' * 5 in ''.join(choices('sd', k=99))
              for _ in range(10000))

print('Chance of streak: %.2f%%' % (100 * chance))
</code></pre>

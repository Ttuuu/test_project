<p>What would you do differently to improve this in any way?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am not sure how expensive it is but I would aim to minimize the number of times <code>res.write()</code> is called. For this I would have the functions to generate rows return a string and collect the strings for each row into an array, then join the array using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/join" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Array.prototype.join()</code></a> to pass to a single call to <code>res.write()</code>.</p>
<hr>
<p>The code makes good use of <code>const</code> to keep the scope of variables limited and avoid accidental re-assignment. It can also be used for constant values that should never change during run-time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Constants can be declared with uppercase or lowercase, but a common convention is to use all-uppercase letters.
<sup><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const#Examples" rel="nofollow noreferrer">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Names like <code>htmlCSS</code> could be <code>HTML_CSS</code>, <code>port</code> could be <code>PORT</code>. That way anyone reading the code will know those values should not be changed. Bear in mind that any object/array declared with <code>const</code> is not immutable unless wrapped in a call to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/freeze" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Object.freeze()</code></a>.</p>

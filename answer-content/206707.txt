<p>I've been looking over your code because I wanted to do what you have done and write a nice thin C++ layer over the C socket APIs, so it's abstracted for modern C++ developers without having to worry about all the (more complex) gubbins that comes with using boost.ASIO</p>

<p>The only point I'd raise is that some names are too close to the C APIs for my liking, for example:</p>

<pre><code>Sock::DataSocket accept = server.accept();
</code></pre>

<p>Could be more descriptive for a higher layer user? Something such as:</p>

<pre><code>Sock::DataSocket client_connection = server.wait_client();
</code></pre>

<p>I dunno, it's a super minor point (especially as the call is blocking - it must wait for something to happen).... Great job BTW!</p>

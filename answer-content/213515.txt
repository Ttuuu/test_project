<p>I do not see any compound KEY, like <code>(date_transaction, approved, deleted)</code>.
Also less indices <em>can</em> improve overall speed - though counter-intuitive.
Much this index might not help. In that case reduce the data for the time being.</p>

<p>Experiment with not using parts, i.e. both GROUP_CONCATs: <code>GROUP_CONCAT(si.id) AS siso_id</code> </p>

<p>One could offer a zoom-in on the group IDs, for a single group, done later.</p>

<p>One can also consider paging: here it might do to offer pages per <em>month</em>, reducing the request per page.</p>

<p>Or create an archive table with query results per month.</p>

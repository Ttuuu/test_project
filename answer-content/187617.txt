<p>This won't solve your problem, but here are some suggestions regarding the organization of the code:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You can use a function like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/8998040/221786">this</a> to fetch four lines at once, which I think makes your code easier to understand than using <code>rest</code>:</p>

<pre><code>with open('test.fastq', 'r') as seq:
    for line1, line2, line3, line4 in group_it(4, seq):
        ...
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Instead of doing <code>if args.phred == 33:</code> you can just use the variable in the calculation, avoiding the repetition:</p>

<pre><code>quality_code=[[(ord(ii)-args.phred) for ii in i] for i in qual.split('\n')]
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
    </div>

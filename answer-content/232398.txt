<ul>
<li><s>The number of times a given value has been added to a statistics batch shouldn't be a <code>long</code>, it should be an <code>int</code> (maybe unsigned).</s> (I was mistaken about what <code>long</code> was).</li>
<li>That would seem to break your <code>Point</code> implementation, but you probably shouldn't be using that in the first place. The items in question aren't "points"; they don't spatially relate to each other. Just use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.tuple?view=netframework-4.8" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tuples</a>.</li>
<li>The <code>DiceQueue</code> class yields <code>int</code>s, so it would be ideal if <code>Statistics</code> also handled <code>int</code>s. Can you make <code>Statistics</code> generic across numerical types?</li>
<li>I suspect that you can shorten/simplify a lot of this using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq?view=netframework-4.8" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Linq</a>, maybe to the point where it no longer needs to be wrapped up in classes the way you have it. But I don't know what that would look like exactly.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's hard to talk about the ideal way to do what you're trying to do without knowing what you're working toward. How will these tools be used?</p>

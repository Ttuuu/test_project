<h2>Time Handling</h2>

<p>Most of your time handling code needs to be rewritten. Read more about time in Python here:</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html</a></p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html</a></p>

<p>Specifically,</p>

<ul>
<li>The entire <code>get_time</code> method needs to be replaced with a call to <code>strftime</code></li>
<li>Stop passing around hours, minutes and seconds separately. Just pass around a <code>datetime.time</code>.</li>
<li>Most of your <code>draw_time</code> method needs to go away. Keep the call to <code>render</code>, but the call to <code>get_time</code> should be replaced with a call to <code>strftime</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Formatting</h2>

<p>Your code is not PEP8-compliant. In particular, your class names need to be capitalized. Running your code through a linter will help this.</p>

<h2>Magic numbers</h2>

<p>What do 22, 28, 736, 695, 930, etc. mean? These need to be replaced with constant variables. Where possible, calculate them from other constants.</p>

<h2>DRY (don't repeat yourself)</h2>

<p>This block:</p>

<pre><code>        if pressed[pygame.K_w] or pressed[pygame.K_UP]:
            # checks if their is a overlap with the wall
            for m in maze.maze_walls:
                player = pygame.Rect(x, y - speed, 10, 10)
                if player.colliderect(pygame.Rect(m[0],m[1],m[2],m[3])):
                    move_up = False
                    break
            if move_up:
                y -= speed
</code></pre>

<p>is repeated four times with very little modification. Consider moving it to a function, and accepting arguments for anything that varies (the two key values, and a 2-tuple of ints to add to the coordinates).</p>

<p>Your code is mostly fine. I'd suggest more meaningful names for variables, e.g. <code>i</code> is typically a name for integer/index variables; since you're iterating over letters/characters, you might choose <code>c</code>, <code>char</code>, <code>let</code>, or <code>letter</code>. For <code>stri</code>, you might just name it <code>phrase</code> (that's what you asked for from the user after all). You get the idea. Make the names self-documenting.</p>

<p>Arguably you could make it look "prettier" by performing a single pass per test, replacing:</p>

<pre><code>stri_up = 0
stri_lo = 0
for i in stri:
    if i.isupper():
        stri_up += 1
    if i.islower():
        stri_lo += 1
</code></pre>

<p>with:</p>

<pre><code>stri_up = sum(1 for let in stri if let.isupper())
stri_lo = sum(1 for let in stri if let.islower())
</code></pre>

<p>That's in theory less efficient, since it has to traverse <code>stri</code> twice, while your original code only does it once, but in practice it's likely faster; on the CPython reference interpreter, <code>sum</code> is highly optimized for this case and avoids constructing a bunch of intermediate <code>int</code> objects while summing.</p>

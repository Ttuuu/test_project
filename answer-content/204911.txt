<li><p>The printing branches are identical, except that they load <code>rcx</code> with different addresses. Better setup <code>rcx</code> when you arrive to the conclusion, and unify printing.</p>

<p>Expanding on that, an idiomatic assembly program would first guess the right string, and correct it if it was wrong:</p>

<pre><code>prime_check_ended:
    mov rcx, numberIsPrime
    cmp cmp qword [isPrime], 1
    je print_result
    mov rcx, numberIsNotPrime

print_result:
    mov rdx, [number]
    call printf
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>I don't know wether NASM supports local labels. If it does, it is a good habit to use them. Otherwise you risk polluting the label space.</p></li>

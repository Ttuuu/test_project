<p>I have a bit of a bone to pick with this:</p>

<pre><code>#define ABS(a) ({ typeof (a) _a = (a); _a &gt; 0 ? _a : -_a; })
</code></pre>

<p>Firstly, <code>typeof</code> is a gcc extension, so by using this, you're making your code less portable. To be fair, for something small like this, it's not a big problem, but it's a bit of a bad habit to get into. In this case, it's also not even needed.</p>

<pre><code>#define ABS(x) ((x) &gt; 0 ? x : -x)
</code></pre>

<p>works just as well.</p>

<p>However, all of this isn't really necessary. <code>&lt;math.h&gt;</code> defines <code>abs</code> (for integers) and <code>fabs</code> (for floating point values) for you. Use the standard library unless you have very good reason not to.</p>

<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>In this function you declare an array of <code>int</code>:</p>

<pre><code>int* createList(int quantity) {
    int list[quantity];    /* &lt;- here */

    printf("Please enter a list of numbers\n");
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; quantity; i++) {
        scanf("%i", &amp;list[i]);
    }
    return list;
} /* list is free'd here, so you return a pointer to free'd memory */
</code></pre>

<p>Accessing the free'd memory you return may cause your program to crash or give you access to part of the memory previously owned by your <code>int</code> array that's since been allocated by other entities in your program. It may vary from day to day what the effect will be. It may even look like it works sometimes. You need to find other means to pass your arrays around. I have ideas but since this is far from working code, you could try to get help at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a> instead.</p>

<p>Instead of using the <em>isPalindrome</em> function to determine if x + y is a length five palindrome, you can create the set of all length five palindromes in the range [10000, 20000) and check for set membership instead. Use the efficient method suggested by Sam Stafford to generate them.</p>

<p>This does not change the time complexity, but should be faster.</p>

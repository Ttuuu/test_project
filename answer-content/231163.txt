<p>Similar to my recent review <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/231064/anipop-the-anime-downloader/231067#231067">here</a>, you can automate the simple repetition of each line by thinking about what's the same in each line, and what's different.</p>

<p>Each line seems to be, essentially:</p>

<pre><code>Y['ElecPriceN'] = df['RT_LMP'].shift(-N)
</code></pre>

<p>The only thing that changes each time is <code>N</code>, so just loop over a <code>range</code> that generates numbers:</p>

<pre><code>for n in range(1, 25):  # range(24) if you started at 0 instead of 1
    Y['ElecPrice' + str(n)] = df['RT_LMP'].shift(-n)
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>Construct a key string by taking <code>n</code>, stringifying it using <code>str</code>, then concatenating it to the name.</p></li>
<li><p>Generate a <code>shift</code> value by just negating <code>n</code>. <code>-n</code> is the same as <code>n * -1</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>As for "I just want to confirm if what I'm doing is correct or not.", that's offtopic here, and too broad of a question for anywhere on Stack Exchange. A broad site like Reddit may be able to help you though.</p>

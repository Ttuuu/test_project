<p>One note, you can skip nearly all of the checks for part 1 by realizing that the second constraint is (almost) guaranteed by the first within the bounds.  If your starting position is <code>37xxxx</code> then only <code>456789</code> doesn't repeat a digit.  Thus you can just construct all increasing values from <code>37xxxx</code> to <code>84xxxx</code> and subtract one.</p>

<p><em>DISCLAIMER: It seems as though the inputs vary per person, so this trick isn't valid for everyone</em></p>

<pre><code># With input 372xxx-84xxxx
# min value 377777, max value 799999
count = -1  # skip 456789
# This loop and/or sum can be collapsed upwards with cleverness
# that is unnecessary for such small ranges of numbers.

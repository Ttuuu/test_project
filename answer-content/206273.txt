<p>Not much to say I think, but here goes:</p>

<ul>
<li>You're using clear, descriptive variable names, which is good. Such names make code easier to understand, which is especially important when you're working on large, complex projects.</li>
<li>Calculating the number of demerit points can be simplified to <code>int demeritPoints = speedDifference / 5;</code>.</li>
<li>Your code always displays the demerit points and suspension message, but from the requirements it looks like it should only do so when the speed exceeds the limit.</li>
<li>Instead of writing <code>"SPEED LIMIT : " + speedLimit</code>, you can use an interpolated string: <code>$"SPEED LIMIT: {speedLimit}"</code>, which makes formatting a little easier.</li>
</ul>

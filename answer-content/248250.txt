<h1>Correctness / Readability</h1>
<p>I'm not sure if this is a bug, or just an unclearness of the algorithm.</p>
<pre><code>    while updated:
        for ... in ...:
            updated = False
            if ...:
                if ...:
                    if ...:
                        ...
                        updated = True
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to loop over the edges, until no change is made, then the <code>updated = False</code> looks like it is in the wrong place.  As it currently stands, if the last edge processed in the <code>for</code> loop fails any of the 3 if conditions, the <code>updated</code> flag is set to <code>False</code>, even if a prior edge set it to <code>True</code>.</p>
<p>Wouldn't the correct implementation be:</p>
<pre><code>    while updated:
        updated = False
        for ... in ...:
            if ...:
                if ...:
                    if ...:
                        ...
                        updated = True
</code></pre>
<p>Now, for each <code>while</code> loop iteration, we start by clearing the flag.  Then, if any edge results in <code>updated = True</code>, a change has been made and the <code>while</code> loop is repeated.</p>
<p>If the <code>updated = False</code> was in the correct place, then the readability of the code could be improved with comments explaining why <code>update = True</code> only matters for the last edge returned by the <code>for</code> loop.</p>

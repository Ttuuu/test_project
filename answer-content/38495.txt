<p>A couple of things I noticed:</p>

<ol>
<li>No Identification Division. "The <code>IDENTIFICATION DIVISION</code> has <em>no</em> effect on the execution of the program but is, nevertheless, <em>required</em> as a means of identifying the program to the computer" - Stern &amp; Stern</li>
<li>There is no real reason for the first <code>REDEFINES</code>. Also, you seem to be using it wrong. A redefines clause is simply another way to reference the same working storage location. If you want to store different data, that will require different variables. While you can keep redefining the same variable and using it in different way, it can get messy and storing things gets harder.</li>
<li>While you can have level 3 variables, I have found it to be best practice to go up in increments of 5</li>
<li>A lot of the time, if you are working in a real COBOL environment, you will need an environment division. Clearly here you don't, but keep that in mind</li>
<li>You should start all variable names in the <code>WORKING-STORAGE SECTION</code> with <code>WS-</code> because if this program need to interact with any other programs, you will have a <code>LINKAGE-SECTION</code> with its own set of variables.</li>
<li>Only use periods to end paragraphs. Technically, you can use a period to end anything. This leads to messy code. Also, a period closes ALL open statements. If you have a triple nested <code>IF</code> and you end with one period, it will close all 3. When you get to that point, use the proper scoop terminators such as <code>END-IF</code> and <code>END-PERFORM</code></li>
<li>Spacing is important as well.</li>
</ol>

<p>The logic problems have already been address in another answer, so I will not address that here. I have included the code below with my suggestions added to it:</p>

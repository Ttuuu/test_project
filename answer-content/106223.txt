<p>I'm just going to look at the code, not the correctness of the algorithm.</p>

<p>On the plus side:</p>

<ol>
<li>You have used a consistent system for labelling functions and variables.</li>
<li>Your code is clean and well laid out, its very easy to read.</li>
<li>You have been consistent with your use of braces.</li>
</ol>

<p>And now the negative:</p>

<ol>
<li>The comments need improvements, saying when a function is called is
OK, but why don't you say what it does and why too. </li>
<li>Why are you using structs instead of classes. </li>
<li>MAXKEYS - This looks like a constant, but it isn't coded as such.  

<ul>
<li>Its a signed value being assigned to an unsigned value.  </li>
<li>Its an odd number being divided by 2 and then integer rounded.  </li>
<li>Why divide by two when you could bitshift? </li>
</ul></li>
<li>If parameters to functions are not being modified then the intention of the author is clearer when you make them const. </li>
<li>If functions don't modify class data then make them const. </li>
<li>medianOffset should be const.  It makes it clearer that you don't intend it to change. </li>
<li>Use typedef to define the structure that holds the data (std::shared_ptr&lt;&gt;) that way you can change it by just editing one place. </li>
<li>You need to program more defensively, you need to check the parameters to public functions are acceptable before you start processing. </li>
<li>Have you considered what happens if '_children' is empty when you call '_children.begin()' in splitNode.</li>
</ol>

<p>If there is anything I've not explained enough please shout.  Hope that helps.</p>

<p>I did another variation of the “list version” of my leap year check. I think it's more readable this time because it doesn't work with these <code>(factor, boolean)</code> pairs. The intend what is going one should be clearer, also because I think I did better naming:</p>

<pre><code>module LeapYear (isLeapYear) where

isLeapYear :: Integer -&gt; Bool
isLeapYear year = hasOddLength $ yearIsDivisibleByList
  where specialIntervals = [4, 100, 400]
        yearIsDivisibleByList = filter yearIsDivisibleBy $ specialIntervals
        yearIsDivisibleBy d = year `mod` d == 0
        hasOddLength = odd . length
<span class="math-container">```</span>
</code></pre>
    </div>

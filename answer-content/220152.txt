<p>Given the limited context, and no information about where the hotspot is in the code, it's difficult to give concrete advice. Here are some musings for your consideration:</p>

<p>For ease of reading, it's preferable to have whitespace after control flow keywords and before the <code>(</code>.</p>

<p>It is suggested to always include curly braces, even when they're not required by the compiler.</p>

<p>Use <code>final</code> where possible to reduce cognitive load on the readers of your code.</p>

<p><code>word</code> should be private.</p>

<p>There's no apparent reason to use <code>char[]</code> instead of just keeping a pointer to the original <code>String</code>. They're costing you time and space to make, to no benefit.</p>

<p>You can short-circuit out of your <code>for</code> loop if the count ever becomes greater than one. Unless a significant fraction of your inputs have a distance of one, you should see some performance gain here.</p>

<p>Using a <code>boolean</code> instead of an <code>int</code> <em>might</em> make a very small difference in execution time, but that would need to be tested. It also makes the code harder to read.</p>

<pre><code>private class WordArray {

    private final String word;

    private WordArray(final String word) {
        this.word = word;
    }

    private boolean isDistanceOne(final char[] otherWord) {
        assert word.length() == otherWord.length;

        int distance = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i &lt; otherWord.length; i++) {
            if (this.word.charAt(i) == otherWord[i]) {
                continue;
            }

            if (distance &gt; 0) {
                return false;
            }

            distance++;
        }


        return distance == 1;
    }
}

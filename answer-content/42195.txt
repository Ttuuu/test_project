<p>This is border line a bad question, as not enough code is given to properly review it.</p>

<p>The variables a -&gt; g look terrible, I would create an array with the numbers you need:</p>

<pre><code>var dataPoints = [1.16,1.19,1.22,1.26,1.30,1.35,1.40];
</code></pre>

<p>Then I would would loop over those points and create an averages object</p>

<pre><code>var averages = {},
    value, x;
for(var i = 0, length = dataPoints.length ; i &lt; length ; i++ ){
  value = dataPoints[i];
  x = Math.pow(value, -(time-lastTime));
  averages[value] = x * lastAverages[value] + (1-x) * distance;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I cannot tell whether the math is correct, if it is not correct, then this question does not belong here :)</p>

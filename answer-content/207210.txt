<p>A few things come to mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>First of all, as you access the list at <code>index + 1</code> without any bounds check, the code will fail if a user attempts to use the method to add elements to the end of the string. You should probably handle that gracefully.</li>
<li>Changing the input parameter's value <code>index</code> is not expressedly forbidden, but it makes my skin crawl. Furthermore, you have to coordinate two values in a loop (<code>s</code> and <code>index</code>) which makes the code error prone. In this case, I'd go for an index based loop instead <code>for(int i = 0; i &lt; strings.length; i++)</code> and use <code>strings[i]</code> and <code>list.get(index + i)</code>. This way, you have only a single variable changing in the loop.</li>
<li>If there's nulls in the list, the code will throw an NPE. Preferably use <code>Objects.equals(x, y)</code> instead of <code>x.equals(y)</code> to stay null-safe.</li>
</ul>

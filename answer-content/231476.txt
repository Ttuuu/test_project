<p>As others pointed out in comments, the question about the difference between <code>.ajax()</code> and  <code>.load()</code> should be and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39576616/any-performance-advantage-of-jquery-ajax-load-vs-get">does exist on SO</a> (and there are related posts like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2076642/difference-between-id-load-and-ajax">the difference between the two</a>. </p>

<p>The PHP code has multiple places with nested <code>for</code> loops that have SQL queries in them. It would be advantageous to extract the values from the WHERE conditions and run one query for each list, then iterate over the results to find the relevant data.</p>

<p>I also see places where query string values are placed directly into the queries without being sanitized. </p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>$veicolo = $_GET['veicolo'];
$veicolo_clause = " AND titolare='$veicolo'";
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This could lead to SQL injection attacks. It would be best to bind parameters and sanitize the values.</p>

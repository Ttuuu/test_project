<p>You definitely need to evaluate that condition based on code you have posted. So, the if/else construct is fine. Alternate options will need you to split the list into separate ones which will be more costly operations.</p>

<p>If I really have to nitpick, I would change the <code>key</code> datatype to <code>int</code> or add another property in <code>Item</code> class itself which is a <code>bool</code>. Perhaps something of is this sort:</p>

<pre><code>class Item
{
    private string _key;
    public string Key
    {
        get
        {
            return _key;
        }

        set
        {
            _key = value;
            IsPhoto = (string.Compare(value, "Photo", true) == 0);
        }
    }

    public bool IsPhoto
    {
        get;
        set;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will remove the string comparison in loop and move it to object creation/update action.</p>

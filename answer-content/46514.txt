<p>Try to visualize how your items are related. Think how your code runs, step by step, like in slow-mo. You will realize you can sum up long and tedious code into simplest, more abstract, styles.</p>
<p>Let me start from the last portion of your code:</p>
<pre><code>    Console.WriteLine("District 1 = {0}", districtCount[0]);
    Console.WriteLine("District 2 = {0}", districtCount[1]);
    Console.WriteLine("District 3 = {0}", districtCount[2]);
    //etc etc
</code></pre>
<p>If you find yourself writing repetitive lines as you have here, there is almost always a better way to code that. Here, a simple loop makes sense:</p>
<pre><code>for (int i = 1; i &lt;= 22; i++)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("District {0} = {1}", i, districtCount[i-1]);
    }
</code></pre>
<p>That makes it short and readable, less convoluted. We merely extracted the 1,2,3... and the 0,1,2... into <code>i</code> and <code>i-1</code> respectively.</p>
<p>Now using the same "trick" you can replace all your ifs (which should have been if else's in the first place) with <strong>just a single line</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>districtCount[districtDataA[i] - 1]++;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>BONUS</strong>: When you want to type <code>variable = variable + 1</code> it's shorter and more readable if you type <code>variable++</code> instead. Same with <code>variable--</code>. For different amounts, you can do <code>variable += amount</code> (also <code>-=</code>, <code>*=</code>, <code>/=</code> and more operators depending on the language)</p>

<p><em>(non-Clojure-specific)</em> Gain performance, sure. Use packed array of odds, where index <code>i</code> represents value <code>2i+1</code>. Then you don't have to deal with evens, which are all non-prime a priori (except the 2 of course). Then you can increment by <code>2*p</code> for a prime <code>p</code> to find its odd multiples twice faster.</p>

<p>For a non-marked index <code>i</code>, the prime <code>p</code> is <code>p = 2*i+1</code>, its square is <code>p*p = (2i+1)(2i+1) = 4i^2 + 4i + 1</code> and <em>its</em> index is <code>(p*p-1)/2 = 2i^2 + 2i = 2i(i+1) = (p-1)(i+1)</code>. For the value increment of <code>2*p</code>, the index increment on 2x-packed array is <code>di = p = 2i+1</code>. </p>

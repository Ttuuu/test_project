<p>The getter method <code>Weapon.timePerShot</code> will return <code>1 / this.fireRate</code>. There doesn't appear to be anything to prevent <code>fireRate</code> from being <code>0</code>. If that is the case, <code>Weapon.timePerShot</code> would return <code>Infinity</code>, which would lead to <code>whenCanFireAgain</code> also being set to <code>Infinity</code>. In some programming languages dividing by zero would lead to an exception being thrown or a warning being emitted. It is wise to avoid this scenario.</p>

<hr>

<p>The <code>while</code> loop in <code>Weapon.fullAuto()</code> declares three variables:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>let localActionEndTime,
    globalActionEndTime,
    action
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The first two variables don't appear to be used. Unless they are to be used by future code, they can be removed.</p>

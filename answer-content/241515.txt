<p>Welcome to the C++ community. You will find a lot of people with outspoken opinions about C++, variating from finding compatibility with C very important to those who find it very dangerous (even in a single person). My opinion: Avoid C unless you have a valid reason to do so, in which case, provide a C API and write the other code in pure C.</p>

<p>Before diving into the code, a small remark: C++17 has <code>std::file_system</code> with a better API than the Windows API. </p>

<p>So to the code:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>const char *</code> is something to avoid, <code>std::string_view</code> and <code>std::string</code> are much better alternatives.</li>
<li>Don't write <code>struct stat status;</code>, <code>stat status;</code> is sufficient and will confuse less c++ programmers</li>
<li>Don't declare variables at the top of the function (main), just declare them where you need them</li>
<li>Use <code>nullptr</code> instead of <code>NULL</code></li>
<li>Don't mix <code>malloc</code> and <code>new</code>, use the latter in C++</li>
</ul>

<p>(PS: For the details, please search online, they can motivate it much better than myself)</p>

<p>If I would be doing your review for a C++ job, I don't like this kind of code to show up. HOWEVER even with that, you could still be hired, cause those things can be taught. What's more important is that you can show how to think about a problem and that you understand C++ concepts.</p>

<p>My next question to you let you show off your knowledge about how to write classes. Public, protected, private, and when to use it. Member functions and variables. How the this-pointer works. What RAII is ...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I need to know if my code is a valid implementation of the factory method pattern. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.</p>

<p>The reason is that the <em>factory</em> cannot be part of the objects to be created. I think you would be surprised to find a factory in the the hedge of your car, wouldn't you?</p>

<p>Generally spoken your approach fails the <em>Separation of Concerns</em> principle.</p>

<p>You have two responsibilities in your code that belong to a <em>factory</em>: </p>

<ol>
<li>identifying the requested type.</li>
<li>creating the actual object.</li>
</ol>

<p>Both should be in a separate factory class.</p>

<hr>

<p>Also: your "factory" is producing the wrong type of objects because of your misconception of inheritance.</p>

<p>We employ inheritance when the child classes differ in <em>behavior</em>. But your <code>Editor</code> extensions only differ in <em>configuration</em> (as far as your code example is showing...).</p>

<p>So what your (yet to build) factory should do is creating the "language depended"  key word list and pass that into a new instance of the one and only <code>Editor</code> class.</p>

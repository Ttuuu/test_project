<p>I don't think there is much you can do in here performance-wise. However, you could improve the readability of your code with a few little things. </p>

<p>I'd personally use a switch statement instead of repeated else/if. It's simpler to read, we know right from the start that all conditions are based on "numberOfWeek".</p>

<p>Maybe there is something we could do repeated Maximized or Minimized conditions and groupBox locations assignments, but I don't really know right now.</p>

<p>Also, I'd return early if the WindowState is equal to LastWindowState. It makes code clearer, and we don't need to go all the way down your class to see that, in case WindowState hasn't changed, you do nothing.</p>

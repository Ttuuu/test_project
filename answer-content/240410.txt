<h2>Data vis considerations</h2>

<p>Currently you seem to have a fixed time-axis range. Consider scaling it as time passes. I have also written an industrial control project with some features similar to this, but my time display was rendered differently and could give you some ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li>The newest data actually appear at the right edge of the graph</li>
<li>The time axis ranges from a negative earliest-seen time to zero, interpretable as "seconds/minutes/etc. ago"</li>
<li>The time axis dynamically changes its units based on how much time has elapsed</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately the code wouldn't be of much use to you since it's in Mono/GTK2, but the algorithm could be used.</p>

<p>Also, your data appear to be exponential in nature. If that holds true I would suggest making the vertical axis logarithmic.</p>

<p>p.s. once your graph is properly scaled you will find that the legend position may need to move to either upper-left or lower-right to avoid occluding your curves.</p>

<h2>Mixing logic and presentation</h2>

<p><code>MainWindow</code> was doing good, adhering to GUI-only tasks - right up until <code>findcoms</code>. This is pretty clearly a business logic concern and should be separated into a different class and/or module.</p>

<p><code>init_test</code> is a big mix of UI and logic, which you should also attempt to decouple.</p>

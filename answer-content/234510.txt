<p>In addition to the other comments, I'll add that expecting a user to enter answers to several prompts and at least three (3) file paths without making a mistake likely leads to a poor user experience.  </p>

<p>For example, the code:</p>

<pre><code>main_path=(r'C:\Users\Sams PC')
next_path=input('Please indicate the folder the files are. E.g. /Desktop/Peaklists \n')
full_path=main_path+next_path
os.chdir(full_path)
</code></pre>

<p>will likely throw an exception if the user doesn't enter a '/' at the begining of the <code>next_path</code>.</p>

<p>Code a function that asks for a filename or path and then verifies that the file exists (or == 'done' or something).  If it doesn't then prompt the user to reenter the filename.</p>

<p>Also, consider using <code>pathlib</code> as an easier way to manipulate filenames or paths in an OS agnostic way.</p>

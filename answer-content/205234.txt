<p>Merge Sort is a great choice when the data don't fit into working memory.  However, our inputs and outputs are all in memory, so we're better off using a more suitable algorithm, such as Quicksort.</p>

<p>Luckily, the C++ Standard Library provides <code>std::sort()</code>, which is intended to be a good choice when inputs fit into memory (it's the implementer's choice of algorithm, not necessarily Quicksort).  A good implementation won't require such a large memory overhead as the hand-written sort (we need space for the entire input <em>and</em> output during the sort - i.e. twice that of the elements, leading to an increased risk of <code>std::bad_alloc</code>; most <code>std::sort()</code> require little or no extra memory during operation).</p>

<p>Summary: use <code>std::sort()</code> and save your brainpower for other challenges.</p>

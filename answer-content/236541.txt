<p>You can eliminate one branch by sorting the inputs:</p>

<pre><code>def solve(a, b, c):
    if a == b == c:
        return 1
    a, b, c = sorted([a, b, c])
    if a == b:
        return c
    elif b == c:
        return a
    return a * b * c
</code></pre>

<p>This makes it a bit shorter. I also like the explicit structure of this code, it is very readable and immediately obvious what happens.</p>

<p>Having immediate returns makes the code also easier to read IMO, although some design philosophies prefer having only a single <code>return</code> per function, as you currently have.</p>

<p>In order to make this even clearer, you should add a <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>docstring</code></a> describing what the function does. Unless required by the challenge, <code>solve</code> is also not a good name for this function, because it does not tell you anything about what the function actually does.</p>

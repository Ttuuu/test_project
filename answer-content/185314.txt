<p>What compiler are you using? Some implementations of the C++ standard library are better than others for supporting Regex.</p>

<p>Do you really need backreferences? That usually makes regex much slower.</p>

<p>It's very unusual to use a variable with the same name as the variable's type.</p>

<p>You don't need to initialize <code>prefix=string</code> before the loop, it's done first thing inside the loop.</p>

<p>Have you done any profiling of your code to see which lines are slowing it down? It'd be very good to know if the slowness is due to the regex or due to the string concatenation.</p>

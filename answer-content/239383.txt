<p>To add to existing review a few points I noticed:</p>

<ul>
<li>You are mixing up under_score (<code>clear_webpage_board</code>) and camelCase naming (<code>createArray</code>). Typically functions in javascript use camelCase (you can see that in all built-in methods that you use, including the borrowed <code>createArray</code>).</li>
<li>Css on the other hand typically uses naming, where dash is used, so <code>thick-right</code>, not <code>thick_right</code>. Ye it's a bit annoying that every technology has different convention naming.</li>
<li>I don't like your namings very much. <code>print_sudoku_to_webpage</code>. That method sychronizes your data with html elements, that represent it. I would call it maybe <code>displayBoard</code> or something (since you call it "board" in another function. <code>print</code> feels off, you don't print anything. <code>webpage</code> also (duh, you are on a webpage, we know that). <code>clear_webpage_board</code>  again drop <code>webpage</code>, no point.</li>
<li>How to use your code if I wanted more sudoku boards on one page? It wouldn't work, because you are always looking for first element with class "sudoku". It feels like there should be one class representing <code>Sudoku</code>, independent from HTML (you have that) and then there should be another class, that can display it in UI, handle events and pass those events to game itself. That class can know this "root element" with class "sudoku" and look for rest of pieces inside of it using <code>querySelector</code> as our colleague in other answer mentioned. That would also clean all your cycles and code, that doesn't have function anywhere. </li>
<li>Consider extracting repeating strings to constants - that will help avoiding bugs. If you make typo mistake in one place but not another, sometimes it's hard to debug. Same goes for numbers - that would also make it easier to generate sudoku with different dimensions.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not a big fan of having a single monolithic function that indiscriminately checks for both increasing and decreasing monotony. In most practical scenarios I would imagine you'd probably need to know if it's increasing or decreasing.</p>
<p>Based on that I'd specifically define:</p>
<pre><code>public static boolean isMonotonic(int[] numbers) {
   return isMonotonicIncreasing(numbers) || isMonotonicDecreasing(numbers);
}

public static boolean isMonotonicIncreasing(int[] numbers) {
   return isXXX(numbers, (a, b) -&gt; a &lt;= b); // Not sure how to call this method
}
</code></pre>
<p>Sure, there will be a couple of duplicate checks, but in the end IMO the code will be better structured, better readable and more re-usable.</p>

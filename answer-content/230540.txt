<p>A useful idea, and very well implemented.</p>

<p>I'd re-write this condition:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>while (!(index &lt; buflen))
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>as</p>

<pre><code>while (buflen &lt;= index)
</code></pre>

<p>Apart from that, I found the code very readable.</p>

<p>It's a good idea to store the received data as <code>int</code> rather than converting to <code>char</code> immediately (though I do worry somewhat about using a signed type in <code>code_point</code> - perhaps its arguments should be narrowed to <code>unsigned char</code>?).</p>

<p>Another minor nit: it's not necessary to assign to <code>buf[3]</code> in the <code>else</code> case, although I see it might aid debugging.</p>

<p>I was never able to get an error return from the program (I tried closing <code>stdout</code> using <code>&gt;&amp;</code> in Bash, and also tried redirecting to <code>/dev/full</code>), but always got an exit status of 0.  That surprised me, as the code looks correct.</p>

<p>I'd have to rate your program a "D-Minus".</p>

<ul>
<li>incorrectly labels 1, 0, and all negative numbers as prime!</li>
<li>runs in <span class="math-container">\$O(n)\$</span> time, instead of <span class="math-container">\$O(\sqrt n)\$</span> time</li>
<li>runs in <span class="math-container">\$O(n)\$</span> space, instead of <span class="math-container">\$O(1)\$</span> space</li>
</ul>

<p>Other deficiencies:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>'''docstrings'''</code> should be used for describing "how" to use the module/class/method; comments should be used to explain how the code works</li>
<li>variable names are cryptic; too short to be descriptive</li>
<li><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="noreferrer">PEP8 guidelines</a> are not consistently followed.  Operators like <code>=</code> should have 1 space on each side.  No space should be used after <code>(</code>, or before <code>)</code>, as well as not before <code>:</code></li>
<li>a dictionary is being used to store a list of values; a simple list would suffice</li>
<li><code>dl.values()</code> is an iterable; there is no need to convert it into a <code>list</code> in order to use in the <code>for z in ...</code></li>
</ul>

<p>All in all it seems OK to me. A couple of things though:</p>

<p>1) </p>

<pre><code>  const int validCodePointCount = 10;
  const int validCodePointOffset = 48;
</code></pre>

<p>The names of these constants are hard to distinguish from each other and to understand in the context and they blur the behavior of the algorithm.</p>

<p>Better names could be:</p>

<pre><code>const int numberBase = 10;
const int zero = '0';
</code></pre>

<p>Here I use <code>'0'</code> instead of <code>48</code> because the first is much more recognizable to programmers than the latter, and we instantly grasp the meaning. In fact in such a relatively small algorithm, I would prefer to use the literals directly in the code than the named constants like: </p>

<pre><code>var digit = (value[index] - '0');
</code></pre>

<p>This is such a common operation and we all know what it's about immediately when seeing it.</p>

<p>In general it is wise to avoid magic numbers, but in some situations it is preferable in order to improve readability - IMO.</p>

<p>2)</p>

<p>You don't have to iterate backwards because you can determine the initial <code>parity</code> from the length of the input string:</p>

<pre><code>var parity = value.Length % 2 != 0;
</code></pre>

<p>You can then iterate forward:</p>

<pre><code>foreach (int n in value.Select(c =&gt; c - '0'))
{
  ...
  parity = !parity;
}
</code></pre>

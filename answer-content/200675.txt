<p>If all you want are the best terms, then it seems to me that you can just keep a list of the current best terms. Every time you find a term that at least as good as any one of the previous best terms, then, assuming transitivity, it must be at least as good as all the previous best terms. And since the previous best terms were at least as good as all the terms tested so far, the new term is at least as good as all the terms tested so for. Next you check whether the new term is strictly better than one of the current best terms. If so, then you can replace the list of best terms with a list containing just the new term. If not, then the current term is just as good as the current best terms, so you should append it to the list of best terms.</p>

<pre><code>best_terms = []
for term in terms:
    if not best_terms:
        best_terms = [term]
        continue
    if not best_terms[0].is_better_than(term):
        if term.is_better_than(best_terms[0]):
            best_terms = [term]
        else
            best_terms.append(term)

<p>I always get my code to be as clean as possible before starting work on performance. Here you have a bare <code>except</code>, which can hide errors. Change it to something better, for now I'll change it to <code>Exception</code>. You are also hiding a potential <code>IndexError</code> and <code>AttributeError</code> if the data ever changes shape as they are in the <code>try</code>.</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>def do_fuzzy_search(country):
    try:
        result = pycountry.countries.search_fuzzy(country)
    except Exception:
        return np.nan
    else:
        return result[0].alpha_3
</code></pre>

<p>Since there are roughly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states" rel="noreferrer">200 sovereign states</a> and you're working with 17003 rows you likely have a lot of the same values hitting a costly function. To resolve this issue you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache" rel="noreferrer"><code>functools.lru_cache</code></a>. Running in amortized <span class="math-container">\$O(n)\$</span> time and <span class="math-container">\$O(n)\$</span> space.</p>

<pre><code>@functools.lru_cache(None)
def do_fuzzy_search(country):
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>Alternately you can sort the data by the provided countries name and then get each country once. Running in <span class="math-container">\$O(n\log n)\$</span> time and <span class="math-container">\$O(1)\$</span> space.</p>

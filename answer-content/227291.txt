<p>A few suggestions to improve the readability and maintenance of your code:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use meaningful variable names. <code>i</code> is well understood, but for all the others give them longer names that describe what they are.</li>
<li>Indent your code consistently. Everything inside that second <code>for</code> loop needs another level of indentation. You'll know it's right when the braces at the end of the code look elegant.</li>
<li>Use braces around the body of loops and conditionals, even when it's not required.</li>
<li>Put a semicolon after each statement, even when it's not required.</li>
<li>Add line comments to describe what sections of code do.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example if <code>y</code> is a couponBook (I'm totally guessing) then start by renaming <code>y</code> to <code>couponBook</code> wherever it's declared and then after applying these suggestions the first few lines could be be:</p>

<pre><code>const couponCount = couponBook.length;

// reset coupons
for (let i = 0; i &lt; couponCount; i++) {
    couponBook[i].coupons = 0;
}
</code></pre>

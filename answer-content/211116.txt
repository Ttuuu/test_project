<p>Here's a few of the things I noticed:</p>

<p>Start learning OOP(Object Oriented Programming).  The .net library and the languages that use it are designed to follow OOP.  With that in mind, the game itself should be in a separate class and many of your functions can be broken down into smaller ones.</p>

<p>The file names.  You are concatenating them on the fly each time you need one, which is at least twice for each one.  Put them in variables and concatenate them once.</p>

<p>Try to get into the habit of using the interpolation operator(<code>$</code>) to concatenate strings.  It is much easier to use and maintain.</p>

<p>The block to check which key is pressed is at best kludgy.  I'm surprised it even works.  You're checking the console for a new key press on each condition that you're checking for.  It seems to me it would make more sense to store a key press then check it against each condition.</p>

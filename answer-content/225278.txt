<p>Following discussion in the comments on the accepted answer above, here is a function which utilises <code>inorder-traverse</code> given there to neatly allow side-effect-only in-order traversal of any binary tree, and return the original tree. Returning the original tree allows chaining, and was inspired by the function <code>mapc</code>.</p>

<p>I'm not sure whether calling this "tap", is the best way to name it - comments welcome.</p>

                    bin-tree))
</code></pre>

<p>Overriding <code>RotateX</code>, <code>RotateY</code> and <code>RotateZ</code> to prevent rotation of your point light source is going to cause you grief when you add another type of light source: the spot light.  A spot light is a directional point light source, and would be both <code>IMovable</code> and <code>IRotatable</code>.  But if you try to derive it from <code>PointLightSource</code>, youâ€™d end up having to add back in the the functionality you took out by overriding.</p>

<p>You probably want to remove <code>IMovable</code> and <code>IRotatable</code> from <code>LightSource</code>, and only add them to derived types that have those attributes.</p>

<p>What is a non-movable, non-rotatable light source you ask?  How about <code>AmbientLight</code>?</p>

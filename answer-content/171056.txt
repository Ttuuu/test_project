  <p>Are there any improvements or suggestions to make it more "friendly" so someone would know how to use it without reading this intro?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The most obvious thing is high-quality XML docs. You've already started, but you need to fill in the param name where it's blank, and the return value for the method where it's missing.</p>

<p>On top of that, adding a summary tag to the class itself containing most of the verbiage above would be helpful.</p>

<p>Reading a little further into your implementation - is it possible to move the code of the <code>AttachLogListener</code> method into a constructor? That would guarantee your order of execution/initialization and make usage more sane and obvious, I think.</p>

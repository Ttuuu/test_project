<p>Your first setting of all the even numbers to 0 is not very efficient, the whole point of sieving is to avoid those costly modulo operations. Try the following:</p>

<pre><code>l = range(2, upperlimit+1) # use list(range(...)) in Python 3
l[2::2] = [0] * ((len(l) - 3) // 2 + 1)
</code></pre>

<p>You can do a similar thing for the setting of zeros of the sieve for other prime numbers, but it gets complicated to figure out how many zeros to add on the right.</p>

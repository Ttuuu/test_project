<h2>Minor issues</h2>

<p><code>head -n -2</code> is not portable.  The <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/coreutils.html#Output-of-parts-of-files" rel="nofollow"><code>head</code> in GNU Coreutils</a> supports a negative number, but it's not POSIX.</p>

<p>If you create temporary files, use <code>mktemp(1)</code>, so that you won't accidentally overwrite an existing file that is coincidentally has the same name as what you chose for the temp file.  Also, immediately set a <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bourne-Shell-Builtins.html#Bourne-Shell-Builtins" rel="nofollow"><code>trap</code> handler</a> to clean up properly, even if the program aborts or is interrupted by <kbd>Control</kbd><kbd>C</kbd>.</p>

<p>If you detect a fatal condition (input file doesn't exist), bail out immediately.  Don't put the error handler at the end, far from where you detected the problem.  You would also avoid a level of indentation for nearly the entire script.</p>

<p>The error message should be printed to standard error, to avoid contaminating standard output.  The exit status of your script should be non-zero in case of an error.</p>

<h2>Single-language approach</h2>

<p>Mixing Bash, AWK, head, and tail is rarely pretty.  Why not write the whole program in AWK alone?</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env awk -f

BEGIN {
    OFS = "\t";
    ELEMENT_FOR_ATOMIC_WEIGHT["12.011150"] = "C";
    ELEMENT_FOR_ATOMIC_WEIGHT["1.007970"] = "H";
}

/^$/ {
    next;               # Ignore all blank lines
}

$2 == "atoms" {
    print $1
}

/Masses/, /Pair Coeffs/ {
    ATOMIC_WEIGHT_FOR_ATOM_TYPE[$1] = $2
}

/Atoms/, /Bonds/ {
    print ELEMENT_FOR_ATOMIC_WEIGHT[ATOMIC_WEIGHT_FOR_ATOM_TYPE[$3]], $5, $6, $7
}
</code></pre>

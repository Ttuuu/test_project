<p>This looks pretty good. I don't really have any big comments, since I found it pretty easy to read. Nits:</p>

<ul>
<li>you could remove the wrapping <code>div</code> with the id <code>orderedList</code>... The <code>ol</code> tag serves the same purpose, plus it's not a very specific name. I think it probably makes more sense to add a <em>class</em> to the <code>ol</code> with a value like <code>tasks</code>.</li>
<li>Generally don't use the index as a key. React uses these to figure out what to redraw. If you have some sort of ID, use that; if not, you can probably just use the task title, or a title + index. You want this to be specific... if the key too specific the component will get redrawn too much (generally not a problem). If the key is to general, components will be "stale"... not redrawn with the proper values.</li>
</ul>

<p>Look good!</p>

<p>The database access information (server address, user name, password, database name) are repeatedly hard coded in each PHP file instead of having them in one common place, where they can be easily changed and configured for each run time environment (development, production, etc.)</p>

<p>Additionally a (production) database should not be accessed using a root user with a blank password.</p>

<p>Personally I never accessed a database in PHP using the built-in low level functions. I found using a database access library lead to less boilerplate code, they had a better readable API, and most importantly built-in security measures, that you can't forget to use. At the very least I would outsource database access into separate repository classes/modules/services.</p>

<p>A common security measure for logins is to have the script return the same result for both unknown account name and wrong password, so that an attacker can't find out if a specific user has an account or not.</p>

<h2>Flat array for display</h2>

<p>It looks like <code>display_field</code> accepts a one-dimensional array. By the time you're manipulating it with business logic and presenting it back to the user, it should be a two-dimensional array. Rather than one format string, you would then call <code>'\n'.join()</code>.</p>

<h2>Presentation vs. business logic</h2>

<p>In several places your presentation ("Impossible", "X") is all conflated with your business logic. Do not use strings to return status from <code>analyze_field</code>. What to use instead depends on a number of factors; some options are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use an Enum</li>
<li>Use a callback object where there is one function per result option</li>
</ul>

<p>Along similar lines, do not store 'x' and 'o' strings in the cells. You can use an Enum here, perhaps with values <code>PLAYER1/PLAYER2</code>. Strings are unconstrained, and a matter of style/presentation/UI rather than business logic, which should be more verifiable.</p>

<h2>Set membership</h2>

<pre><code>if abs(num_x - num_o) not in [0, 1]:
</code></pre>

<p>can be</p>

<pre><code>if abs(num_x - num_o) not in {0, 1}:
</code></pre>

<p>since order does not matter and set lookup has O(1) time complexity. That said, I think this is equivalent to</p>

<pre><code>if not(-1 &lt;= num_x - num_o &lt;= 1):
</code></pre>

<p>assuming that <code>num_x</code> and <code>num_o</code> are integral.</p>

<h2>Zip</h2>

<p>I question this logic:</p>

<pre><code>for row, column in zip(rows, columns):
    if len(set(row)) == 1:
        num_winners += 1
    if len(set(column)) == 1:
        num_winners += 1
</code></pre>

<p>I think what you're looking for is a chain, not a zip:</p>

<pre><code>for sequence in chain(rows, columns):
    if len(set(sequence)) == 1:
        num_winners += 1
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, there's no point to checking a row and its corresponding column in the same loop iteration.</p>

<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>I think this should work:</p>

<pre><code>extras = ('country_code', 'price_type')

for field in extras:
    if filters[field] is None:
        filters.pop(field)

if any(field in filters for field in extras):
    items = Price.query.filter_by(**filters)
else:
    items = Price.query
</code></pre>

<p>The key is realizing that if there are <em>any</em> filters defined, you have to <code>.filter_by()</code> them.  Note that this doesn't affect the actual query efficiency, which is database dependent.</p>
    </div>

<p>Instead of accepting a container, accept an iterator pair.  We may want to use just part of a container (e.g. after using <code>std::partition</code>).  In C++20, a standard <code>forward_range</code> view could be used.</p>

<p>It probably makes sense to use different implementations for forward-access and random-access collections (there's a single-pass algorithm for selecting 1 out of an unknown number of elements, so we could even accept input iterators).</p>

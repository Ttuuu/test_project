<p>My comments are with respect to design of the game.
I see responsibilities of entities are mixed up in many places</p>

<ul>
<li>Player should not initialize pieces. We can move the responsibility to board. Board and pieces doesn't need to know about players.</li>
<li>Pieces should not handle move. Pieces can provide list of possible moves to reach the destination path but board should choose a valid path.</li>
<li>Board should have check for "Check Mate" condition.</li>
<li>Game should track the players move history and piece color selection.</li>
<li>Player class should have only player details.</li>
</ul>

<p>A rough class diagram is attached below

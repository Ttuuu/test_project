<p>Your code is indeed sub-optimal.</p>

<p>When looking at a task do not start writing some loops, but think about it is made up of simpler tasks.</p>

<p>A word is in a two-dimensional crossword grid if any of the below is True:</p>

<ul>
<li>The word is in any of the rows.</li>
<li>The word is in any of the columns.</li>
<li>The word is in any of the diagonals.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, the general outline of the method may be:</p>

<pre><code>class WordGrid {
  public contains(String word) {
    return any(word in row for row in getRows())                ||
           any(word in column for column in getColumns())       || 
           any(word in diagonal for diagonal in getDiagonals())
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now you just have to translate this pseudocode to real code and implement the three <code>get</code> methods and the problem will be solved.</p>

<p>This is my suggestion because:</p>

<ul>
<li>The general idea can be understood at a glance, if the reader wants more details he can read the helper methods.</li>
<li>It is made of many small pieces, that may be reused and are simpler to write on their own.</li>
<li>It is general working, for any grid and word size.</li>
</ul>

<p>To address your immediate concern, yes it is a merge sort.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The naming is quite unusual. The procedure you call <code>merge</code> does the merge sort, and should be called so. The <em>merge</em> phase of the merge sort is done by the</p>

<pre><code>    while i != length_firstHalf and j != length_secondHalf:
</code></pre>

<p>loop and the subsequent <code>return</code>. It is advisable to factor it out into a standalone <code>merge</code> procedure. OTOH I don't endorse a complicated return expressions.</p></li>
<li><p>It is unclear why do you limit yourself to the distinct values. The second <code>if</code> clause may be safely made into an <code>else</code>, and there is no more worries. Notice that your first comparison <code>firstHalf[i] &gt; secondHalf[j]</code> <em>is</em> the way to handle duplicates.</p></li>
<li><p>Computing <code>half</code> doesn't belong to the base case.</p></li>
<li><p>As a nitpick, <code>length == 1 or length == 0</code> is a long way to say <code>length &lt; 2</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

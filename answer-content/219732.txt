<p>Since lists are passed by reference, the two lists that are passed as arguments will be half-empty after the function returns.</p>

<pre><code>a = [1, 2, 4]
b = [3, 5]

merge_lists(a, b)

print(a) # is empty now but shouldn't
print(b) # only contains 5 now
</code></pre>

<p>Therefore you should not use <code>list.pop</code> at all but instead iterate over the lists via indexes, since these don't modify the lists.</p>

<p>Instead of the if-then-else expression at the end, you can just write:</p>

<pre><code>Outlist.extend(L1)
Outlist.extend(L2)
</code></pre>

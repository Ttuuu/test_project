<p>Overall the code looks fine. There aren't any drastic changes I would advise - just mostly a few simplifications. As far as the design goes it looks good, though it may be wise to add a spinner icon or some other indication while the data is loading, lest the user think nothing is happening. And it doesn't appear that anything happens when <code>errored</code> is set to true. Perhaps the UI should notify the user that there was a problem fetching the data.</p>

<p>The URL doesn't really change so it doesn't need to be in the <code>data</code> object. I would move it out to a constant.</p>

<pre><code>const API_URL = "https://randomuser.me/api/?&amp;results=500&amp;inc=name,location,email,cell,picture";
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>I understand what the following block in the filter function of <code>searchResults()</code> is doing:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>            const {
                first,
                last
            } = user.name;
            const {
                email
            } = user;
            const {
                city
            } = user.location;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>But is it really necessary to define all of those things instead of just using the properties, as in below? I could maybe see a point for the nested properties but not so much for <code>user.email</code>...</p>

<pre><code>return `${user.name.first} ${user.name.last}`.toLowerCase().match(lowerCaseSearch) ||
    user.email.toLowerCase().match(lowerCaseSearch) ||
    user.location.city.toLowerCase().match(lowerCaseSearch);
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>The following CSS rulesets could be combined:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>.table-container .panel-heading {
  font-weight: bold;
}
.table-container .panel-heading {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
}
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The font-weight specification could be moved into the lower declaration block, unless you wanted to pull the bold specification out of the heading ruleset (i.e. <code>.table-container .panel-heading h2</code>) and combine it with the lone bold rule.</p>

<p>I don't know why an iframe was suggested to you, but I do see some possibilities for vulnerability.</p>

<p>For your platforms, I would validate server-2-server.</p>

<p>Flow:</p>

<p>If client claims to be logged in ( in JS / has token in local storage), send token to the platform itself.</p>

<p>The receiving endpoint (let's say platform1_showProfile.php) sends a curl-request to the SSO platform in order to validate (and or logout/refresh if expired etc)</p>

<p>For performance reasons, you will want to ask yourself whether </p>

<ol>
<li><p>JWT is only your SSO authentication method while maintaining state on each platform or if you want to go stateless and use the sso-endpoint on each call.</p></li>
<li><p>WordPress is the right solution for this. Consider setting up an authentication server with slimframework or neoan3</p></li>

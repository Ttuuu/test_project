<p>The built-in <code>sorted()</code>, which uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Timsort</a>, is always preferable, but since you said you were learning bubble sort, I would stick with it even though it is too slow and mutate the input list instead of creating a new one.</p>

<pre><code>numbers = input("Enter numbers separated by a comma: ")
numbers = [int(n) for n in numbers.split(',')]

end = len(numbers) - 1

while end != 0:

    for i in range(end):
        if numbers[i] &gt; numbers[i + 1]:
            numbers[i], numbers[i + 1] = numbers[i + 1], numbers[i]

    end = end - 1
</code></pre>

<p>Running it:</p>

<pre><code>Enter numbers separated by a comma: 3, 0, 1, 4, 2
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>

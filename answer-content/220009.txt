<p>It sure sounds like you're running out of memory as you try to build (or allocate) the buffer. </p>

<ul>
<li>You need to figure out how big a buffer you can (or want to) use. You'll need to ask the system how much RAM it has, and how much is available, and make your buffer that large.</li>
<li>You might get a small boost by opening the file as explicitly write-only.</li>
<li>You'll need to flush the buffer as you go. Something shaped like this psudo-code might work:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>free = system.free_ram();
use = hungry * free;
buffer = new bytes_buffer_to_file("filename", size=use);
try{
  current_buffer = 0;
  while(line = get_bytes_needing_to_be_written()){
    if(current_buffer + line.length &gt; use){
      buffer.flush();
      current_buffer = 0;
    }
    buffer.append(line);
    current_buffer += line.length;
  }
}
finally{
  buffer.flush();
  buffer.destroy();
}
</code></pre>

<p>It's weird that you made both an array <code>char[] arr</code> and a <code>StringBuffer str1</code>. You've solved the problem twice, and discarded the <code>arr</code> result. And each solution is suboptimal.  The array can be populated using <code>String.toCharArray()</code>. The <code>StringBuffer</code> is unnecessary, since you know the size of the buffer in advance, and you can eliminate the special case for odd-length strings if you don't build a new string from scratch. In any case, since you don't need thread safety, you would be better off with a <code>StringBuilder</code> instead of a <code>StringBuffer</code>.</p>

<pre><code>public static String swapPairs(String str) {
    char[] arr = str.toCharArray();
    for (int i = 1; i &lt; arr.length; i += 2) {
        char swap = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[i - 1];
        arr[i - 1] = swap;
    }
    return new String(arr);

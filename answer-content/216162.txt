<p>Be careful when naming things. The "Console" part of <code>ConsoleAddressBook</code> is IMHO pointless. <code>ContactsList</code> isn't a <code>List</code> but a <code>Dictionary</code>, and thus the name doesn't correspond with the type -- why not simply name it <code>Contacts</code> or <code>ContactsByPhoneNumber</code>?</p>

<p>A phone number isn't an <code>int</code>. See also <a href="https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/blob/master/FALSEHOODS.md" rel="noreferrer">this list of Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Phone Numbers</a>.</p>

<p>Separate your UI from your back-end code. <code>ConsoleAddressBook</code> mixes the two and thus becomes hard to maintain. What would have impressed me is a somewhat mature application where there is such a separation, whereas I'd regard your code as a typical "whipped this up in an hour" stopgap solution.</p>

<p>This code looks good to me. There are a few things I would do differently.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you restructure things a bit you can compute the minimum and maximum more simply from the sorted array, since you have it.</li>
<li><code>intdup</code> is only called once, which in my opinion is grounds to inline it.</li>
<li>You dynamically allocate your array copy and don't free it. Of course in this program it's no big deal, but that's a bad habit to get into. If you're using C99 you could even do this without <code>malloc</code> by using a variable-length array.</li>
<li>My favorite technique for handling functions that populate memory (structures, arrays) is to pass the memory to be filled into the function. That way the allocation and deallocation happen in the same place, in the caller. Something to consider.</li>
</ul>

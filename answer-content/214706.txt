<p>When working with <code>DateTime</code> it's usually a good idea to not use a hardcoded <code>DateTime.Now</code>. This makes testing such methods very difficult because you cannot mock it so you have to write very tricky tests all with <code>Now</code>. You allso cannot easily switch to <code>UtcNow</code> etc. and you have to know which <em>now</em> it uses internally.</p>

<p>A much better solution would be to use another parameter like <code>DateTime referenceDate</code>. This way you can use any combinations of the two values and create more predictable and easier to understand tests.</p>

<p>Additionally I'd make this method static because it does not access any class fields etc.</p>

<p>Oh, I also need to add that you use excelent variable names! This is exactly how it should be done! ;-)</p>

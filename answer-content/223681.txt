<p>Splitting the input, parsing the parts, figuring the bits and filling the hosts list should all be seperate methods that return the results to main. <br>
Every method should perform a simple task. If you list the steps necessary to perform an action, each step should be a separate method. <br>
Commenting a methods purpose above it will help you and others understand it's inner workings. <br>
Bits and bites are not the same thing. 
<code> double totalbites = Bits - S; </code><br>
Also variable names should not start with a capital unless they are all capitals. <br>
Variable names like A, B, C, E, X, S are not very helpful.<br> input1, input2,... and num1, num2,... would convey a clearer picture of these variables purpose. <br>
Use comments to explain the actions taking place. <br></p>

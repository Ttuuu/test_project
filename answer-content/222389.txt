<p>Some suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li>The translations strings are duplicated, and are present in code rather than as a separate text file. I've not done i18n yet, but that seems strange. I would expect a .po file containing text and translations.</li>
<li><code>user_imputs</code> should be <code>user_inputs</code></li>
<li>You mix four types of string formatting: <code>+</code>/<code>+=</code>, <code>%</code>, <code>.format()</code> and f-strings. The first two I believe are generally discouraged in favour of the last two.</li>
<li><code>add_list_of_advices</code> is confusing. The two calls to it each use a different branch of the method, and there is <em>no</em> common code between the branches. it looks like inlining it would actually make the code more readable.</li>
<li>This is just personal style, but on the last major project my colleagues and I have found that 80 character width is too limiting - you end up having to artificially abbreviate names (which reduces readability) or use some very clunky line splitting (also reducing readability) far too often. We found that we can fit two files side by side with 120 character line widths on a modern screen; your experience may vary.</li>
</ul>

<p>In any case, this is some of the best code I've seen on this site!</p>

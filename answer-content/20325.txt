<p>So far I think you are doing a decent job of obfuscation, if that's what you want.</p>

<p>If only your server is supposed to see the data, then it should stay on your server. Your server will have some index of data (session? database?) mechanism for identifying which data the client is working with, and only send the client the index to the data, not the data itself.</p>

<p>BUT based on your comment about wanting to obfuscate the indices, maybe some more validation logic on your server would be the best solution. If you don't want the user to mess with the query string to do something, then come up with rules that the server can use to determine whether access is valid at that time and allow the user to create his own query strings if he wants to.</p>

<p>You can't build a truly secure website until you can allow advanced users to access your server by any means they choose, including constructing raw HTTP requests.</p>

<h3>Technicality</h3>
<p>Pedantically speaking, the <code>GP_get_type</code> function has undefined behavior if the pointer it gets isn't a pointer into (or one past the end of) <code>GP_format</code> (see ยง6.5.8/5 <em>Relational operators</em>).</p>
<p>Simple enough to fix: wrap <em>all</em> the arguments, including the first one and any string literal with <code>GP</code>.</p>
<p>You could enforce that with an assertion in <code>GP_get_type</code> (instead of the <code>if</code>, get rid of the default), but... you can't escape undefined behavior in that assertion :-)</p>
<p>I can't think of real-world circumstances on ordinary compilers/environments where this particular usage would be problematic though.</p>

<p>You have 147 lines of code in your program. It is very complex running backwards and forward through functions when it can be handled with straight forward logic. Below is an unfinished simple example of just 18 lines of code that handles pretty much all of the foundation without the need to define functions. It includes list comprehension and a just few conditional catch statements.</p>

<pre><code>import random

words = ['cheese', 'biscuits', 'hammer', 'evidence'] 
word_choice = [i.lower() for i in random.choice(words)]
lives = 3
cor_guess = []
while True:
  print('Letters found: {}\nWord length: {}'.format(cor_guess, len(word_choice)))
  if lives == 0:
      print('Your dead homie!\nThe word was: ', word_choice)
      break
  guess = str(input('Guess a letter: '))
  if guess in word_choice:
      print(guess, 'is in the word!\n')
      cor_guess.append(guess)
  else:
      print('Your dying slowly!\n')
      lives -= 1
  ...
  ...
</code></pre>

<p>With <code>print</code> you do not need to add extra print line to get another blank line, you can use triple quotation marks and place the information where ever you like. For instance:</p>

<pre><code>print('''
lives = {}
#hangman picture#



letters found: {}
'''.format(lives, letters_found)
</code></pre>

<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>I'd name the procedure <code>Assign</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Dim foo As Long
Assign foo, 42
</code></pre>

<p>But then, this is involving a stack frame for an otherwise very straightforward operation - the method intending to be generic, it cannot bring any additional logic to the table, and ultimately comes off as redundant.</p>

<p>A <code>Property Let</code> procedure is more problematic though, because such procedures always receive their value/RHS parameters <code>ByVal</code> - regardless of whether or not it says <code>ByRef</code>; <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/231795/23788">M.Doerner's answer</a> gives more details about the implications of this.</p>

<p>I wouldn't use either version of this code, and use explicit built-in keywords (<code>Set</code>) and operators (<code>=</code>) instead, as appropriate. Not knowing what type you're dealing with means you're coding late-bound, which isn't ideal in the first place.</p>

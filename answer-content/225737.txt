<p>The first thing that stands out here to me is that you should be using <code>__get_item__</code> and <code>__set_item__</code>, and <code>__repr__</code> instead of <code>get-key</code>, <code>set-key-value</code> and <code>print_hashmap</code>. This will opt you into the syntax of collections in python where you use <code>d[key]</code> to get a key, <code>d[key] = val</code> to set a value, and <code>print(d)</code> to print it. This may seem trivial, but the fact that python lets containers you have written to feel as nice as base ones is a large part of why Python is such a natural feeling language as opposed to something like Java, where this style would be considered correct.</p>

<p>"A note on defining methods."</p>

<p>This method has no added value whatsoever. All it does is calling another method with same method signature (with the first arg shifted as invokee). This could have been a good choice if either (1) you needed some validation (2) argument/result type parsing was involved (3) calling this method would have been a lot less code to type. But none of these are true. Try avoiding an <em>anti-pattern</em> like this.</p>

<p>Your header files seem to be including unnecessary things, apparently for convenience.  A header should only include the files required for that header to compile.  Anything else just adds to the compile overhead for files that include the header but don't need those details.</p>

<p><code>float</code> parameters should be passed to functions by value, not reference.  Passing by value will allow them to be passed in registers, while reference needs both a memory location and a register to hold the address.</p>

<p>You don't need to use the <code>inline</code> keyword when defining a member function in a class, as those are implicitly inline.</p>

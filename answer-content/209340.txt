<h1>What should the type signature of these functions be?</h1>

<p>I would really separate the IO from data. In addition, I would display data that you already have. I would not have <code>valid_or_not</code> print stuff out. Instead I would have it <em>return</em> a <em>value</em>. But what value?</p>

<p>Furthermore, don't read global variables. <code>valid_or_not</code> and <code>list_tweak</code> should take paramters.</p>

<p>We'll get to printing stuff in the end.</p>

<h1>What do you want to do with an invalid credit card number?</h1>

<p>You are both throwing an error, and also printing out whether it is a valid card number. I would say there is a couple ways to go, but I prefer this approach:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Return an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>enum</code></a> that ends up being either: <code>VALID</code>, <code>INVALID_CHECKSUM</code>, or <code>INVALID_FORMAT</code>. Instead of doing printing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Rework the flow of <code>valid_or_not</code>.</h1>

<p>Consider reworking <code>valid_or_not</code> to do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Check to see if the format is valid, and return <code>INVALID_FORMAT</code> if it is not.</li>
<li>The run <code>list_tweak</code>, but don't do <code>try</code>-<code>except</code> on it, return either <code>INVALID_CHECKSUM</code> or <code>VALID</code> depending on <code>list_tweak</code>.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Naming.</h1>

<p>I am not sure what <code>list_tweak</code> means, but I am assuming only because I've seen this problem show up time and time again that it is the Luhn algorithm. Name it something appropriate like <code>luhn_checksum</code>.</p>

<h1>IO</h1>

<p>So what should we really be doing for input? First we should have a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/20158605/667648"><code>main</code> function</a> (see the link for more information why. Thus we get:</p>

<pre><code>def main():
    cardnumber = input('Enter your credit card number: ')
    print(valid_or_not(cardnumber))


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</code></pre>

<p>See all the data is manipulated in <code>valid_or_not</code> which is <em>then</em> displayed, instead of displaying information withing <code>valid_or_not</code>).</p>

<p>I found a solution, but the query is really slow (on first time, it's obviously quick when coming from cache).
This new query is great, it does exactly what I want finally (get only the comments after a user commented), but unfortunately it's slow (~2 sec), when not cached.</p>

<pre><code>$sql = "SELECT p1.* FROM comment p1 INNER JOIN
          (SELECT max(seen) last_seen, max(id) MaxId,
          user_id, topic_id, picture_id, news_id, date
          FROM comment WHERE user_id='$me' and deleted=0
          GROUP BY topic_id, picture_id, news_id) p2
       ON p1.topic_id = p2.topic_id and p1.picture_id= p2.picture_id
       and p1.news_id= p2.news_id
       WHERE p1.date &gt; p2.last_seen and p1.id &gt; p2.MaxId and deleted=0
       GROUP BY p1.topic_id, p1.picture_id, p1.news_id ORDER BY p1.date DESC"
</code></pre>

<p>The original query was this one:</p>

<pre><code>$sql = "SELECT p1.* FROM comment p1 INNER JOIN 
      (SELECT max(date) MaxPostDate, user_id 
       FROM comment WHERE user_id='$me' and deleted=0 
       GROUP BY topic_id, picture_id, news_id) p2 
    ON p1.user_id = p2.user_id AND p1.date = p2.MaxPostDate 
    WHERE p1.user_id='$me' and deleted=0 
    ORDER BY p1.date DESC"
</code></pre>
    </div>

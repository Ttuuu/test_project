<p>First, the default value seems like it's overkill here. The function should be a <code>Min</code> function or a <code>Max</code> function, not both.  It's not going to kill you to have two functions with clear arguments that describe what they are doing.</p>

<p>The naming is suspect too.  <code>SelValue</code> doesn't sound like the name of a <em>function</em> - it sounds like a procedure or property.  It invokes the idea of doing something, not returning a value. I'd rename it. Note that I can't even suggest a good name because of the first thing, because <code>FindHigherOrLowerOfTwoNumbers()</code> seems a little... weird.</p>

<p>As far as performance, that would be the last thing on my mind. This is only performing comparison operations between numbers, and that should be blazingly fast regardless of how many extra comparisons you've managed to sneak in there:</p>

<ul>
<li>You don't have to check explicitly to see if they're both zero. If they're equal and both happen <strong><em>to be</em></strong> zero, you'll get zero back anyway.</li>
<li>If both of them are the same, that's the only check you need to do. Just pick one and return it.</li>
</ul>

<p>VBA's <code>If</code> statements don't short circuit, so I'd structure this as a <code>Select Case</code> and filter away remaining cases on my way down. </p>

<pre><code>Select Case True
    Case ValOne &lt; 0 Or ValTwo &lt; 0
        SelValue = -1
    Case ValOne = ValTwo
        SelValue = ValOne
    Case NeedMax
        If ValOne &gt; ValTwo Then
            SelValue = ValOne
        Else
            SelValue = ValTwo
        End If
    Case ValOne &lt; ValTwo
        SelValue = ValOne
    Case Else
        SelValue = ValTwo
End Select
</code></pre>

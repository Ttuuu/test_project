<p>If you need a type with exactly 64 bits, use <code>uint64_t</code> (from <code>&lt;stdint.h&gt;</code>).  That will give a clear compilation error if no such type is available.</p>

<p>Given that the function never returns anything other than zero, we can move the cleanup of <code>n</code>, <code>n0</code> and <code>n_max</code> outside the loop, and simply <code>break</code> to reach them.</p>

<p>Is indefinite looping really a good output if a cycle is detected?  How is that distinguishable from an arbitrarily long (but finite) chain?  Look up the standard algorithms for cycle detection in your graph theory textbook.</p>

<h2>Are you reinventing the wheel?</h2>

<p>I'm sorry if this addresses just a little part of your question, but if you're looking for a way to get an event when a property is changed, have you thought about implementing <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms743695.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">INotifyPropertyChanged (msdn)</a>?</p>

<p>With this you could do stuff like:</p>

<pre><code>public class Person : INotifyPropertyChanged 
{
    ...
    public string PersonName 
    {
        get { return name; }
        set { name = value; OnPropertyChanged("PersonName"); }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And with some accompanying stuff you'll get event handling almost for free. I've also seen a similar pattern, but can't find it just now, where you set the new value as part of the property change handling.</p>

<p>In other words, you might have reinvented the wheel, and on the flip side I might have misunderstood your question.</p>

<h2>A few style comments</h2>

<p>Here goes for a more proper review of your code, not focusing on the reinvention which you seems to want to do.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Magic number within <code>Invoke</code> &gt; <code>var interceptedArgs = ...</code></em> - You do a call to <code>Substring(4)</code> which presumably refers to the text after <code>SetterMethodStart</code>, but this should then be the length of this variable in case it got changed or someone decides to use a more common <code>setVariableName</code> structure in their code. </li>
<li><em>Is <code>SetterMethodStart</code> named according to conventions?</em> – According to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/242534/c-sharp-naming-convention-for-constants">this</a> you are correctly naming it like you've done, but as this is extremely similar to the MethodNames I'm inclined to suggesting to use <code>SETTER_METHOD_START</code> or <code>_SetherMethodStart</code>. But then again that is kind of against the guidelines...</li>
</ul>

<h2>How do you use it?!</h2>

<p>The last point I would like to make, is that I still don't quite get how you want to practically use this. And neither do I quite understand how you separate from get notified on all changes to any property or what/where your filter code is.</p>

<p>As such, there might be something said regarding useful comments within your code describing use cases and the point of using your class. The code and comments you have now are somewhat obvious and at the same time unclear as to the real purpose of your code. </p>

<p>A typical example is <em>"Proxy that intercepts call to methods"</em> which kind of says what it does, but then again why does it do that, and what is the purpose of doing this?  Maybe a better comment would be <em>"Intercepts calls to setter methods (a.k.a. methods prefixed with <code>set_</code>), and for these invokes <code>PropertyChanged.Invoke</code> with arguments`"</em></p>

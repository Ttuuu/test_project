<p>You're not following PEP8 and you still have a spaghetti mind-set. Each function should have a single responsibility.</p>

<p><code>value_input</code> however is in charge of:</p>

<ol>
<li>Asking and validating user input.</li>
<li>Handling how to convert the input.</li>
<li>Convert and display the input.</li>
</ol>

<p><br>
This should instead only perform the first task I've said above. After this you should have the calling code perform 2 and 3.</p>

<p><code>convert_c2f</code> also is responsible for two things converting and displaying the input.</p>

<p>It can be seen in <code>main</code> that you were originally doing something better than you have now, so it's unclear why you changed this.</p>

<p>As you mentioned, as-is the system is not at all secure. However, it is easy to hash passwords properly, and this is a great opportunity to learn the concept.</p>
<p>The idea of password hashing is to add a random salt, which makes it harder to use precomputed tables for breaking the password, and a one-way function which can only be "encrypted", but not "decrypted". The output of the one-way function is stored. When the user inputs a new password, the one-way function is applied again and the output is compared to the stored value. There is no way to decrypt the password without first knowing it.</p>
<p>One of the best current password hashing schemes is <strong>bcrypt</strong>. For Python, this is provided by the <code>bcrypt</code> module, which has to be installed. On Linux distributions, it is usually available in package <code>python3-bcrypt</code>. On Windows and Mac, you can install it with <code>pip install bcrypt</code>.</p>
<p>There is a <a href="http://zetcode.com/python/bcrypt/" rel="noreferrer">good tutorial on bcrypt usage here</a>. When applied to your code, you'd generate the salt and compute hash when user first provides the password:</p>
<pre><code>            credentials.append(password)
</code></pre>
<p>becomes:</p>
<pre><code>            password_utf8 = password.encode('utf-8') # Convert to UTF-8 for hashing
            salt = bcrypt.gensalt() # Generate random salt
            hash = bcrypt.hashpw(password_utf8, salt) # Apply one-way function
            credentials.append(hash) # Store the hash
</code></pre>
<p>And when verifying, use <code>bcrypt.checkpw()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>if enter_password == file.read():
</code></pre>
<p>becomes:</p>
<pre><code>if bcrypt.checkpw(enter_password, file.read()):
</code></pre>
<p>If you then look into the file, you'll see a string like <code>$2b$12$viuQE9cX.ZCoqZewzRqJz.Ae76yYRH.4fkOKe9CJPl3ssm6n50AiC</code>, which is the hashed password.</p>

<p>I don't think you should have constructors that don't take a <code>List&lt;ControlCard&gt;</code> as parameter. It doesn't have any value since this way the <code>TuringMachine</code> won't be able to operate. If I want a machine that'll execute 0 operations, I'll pass an empty <code>List&lt;ControlCard&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>You should specify visibility modifier for your class members, at least I think. We could argue that since the default value is private and that considering OOP members should always be private this wouldn't matter, but I think it would add to the readability!</p>

<p>In your <code>ToString()</code> method you could use <code>string tapeString = String.Join("",tape)</code> instead of </p>

<pre><code>string tapeString = "";
foreach (var item in this.tape)
{
    tapeString += item;
}
</code></pre>

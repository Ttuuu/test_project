<p>If you want your <code>Theme</code> to be unaware of what is valid or invalid which makes sense as <code>ThemeLoader</code> may be responsible for defining it, you may try writing something like ef core's fluent api.</p>
<p>Something like following;</p>
<pre><code>    var validator = new ThemeValidator&lt;Theme&gt;();
    validator.Property(theme =&gt; theme.AccentBrush)
        .IsRequired();
    validator.Propert(theme =&gt; theme.AccentBrushLight)
        .IsRequired();
    validator.validate(theme); // raises exception
</code></pre>
<p>This may look like what you do as you have to define for each variable. But i think, this way is open for extension as different conditions other than null check become necessary.</p>

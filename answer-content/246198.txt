<h1>Memory Leaks</h1>
<p>The application is leaking memory. Visualizing the graphs shows how the memory used constantly goes up, in the hundreds of megabytes.</p>
<h1>C++</h1>
<p>The code is mostly C. Using C++ property can help with resource management (RAII)</p>
<h1>Console Output</h1>
<p>Although only used for logging, writing to the console often can have a significant performance cost in this case.</p>
<h1>Compressing the image</h1>
<p>Saving to PNG consumes most of the CPU time in the case of this application. As others have mentioned, this can be at least parallelized, altough you need to make sure the library used works under multiple threads without issues.</p>
<h1>Reusing resources</h1>
<p>You create new bitmaps every time. As the screen resolution rarely changes, consider reusing the bitmaps over multiple calls.</p>
<p><code>Gdiplus::Bitmap bmp(*hbitmap, nullptr);</code> also takes a lot of time. It probably copies the bitmap. This could also be avoided.</p>

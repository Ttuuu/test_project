<p>First, I recommend <code>set -eu</code> early in the script to abort on errors and to make any use of unset variables be an error.</p>

<p>Second, If <code>HOSTNAME</code> is unset, we probably want to fallback to running the <code>hostname</code> command.  There seems little point in assigning it to a variable we use only once:</p>

<pre><code># (simplified to show only the relevant part)
cat &lt;&lt;EOF
    hostname=${HOSTNAME:-$(hostname)}
EOF
</code></pre>

<p>Then we can delete the line <code>myHostName="$HOSTNAME"</code>, as it's no longer used.</p>

<p>Third, the other thing missing is <code>umask 077</code> to ensure that the file isn't created readable by anyone else (important, as it contains cleartext credentials).</p>

<hr>

<p>When reading email address, it shouldn't be necessary to hide it using <code>read -s</code> - only the password ought to be a secret.</p>

<p>When reading the password, there's no need to mention that confirmation is not required, as we wouldn't normally expect it here: we use confirmation when <em>creating</em> a password (so the user doesn't accidentally lock herself out of her account by a simple invisible typing error).  Here, we're entering an <em>existing</em> password, and any error can be corrected just by re-running the script.</p>

<h1>Edited script</h1>

<p>Applying my suggestions, we get:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

set -eu

umask 077  # Ensure others can't read the file

read -p "Please paste your Gmail proxy email address: " \
     gmail_proxy_email_address
read -sp "Please paste your Gmail proxy email password:" \
     gmail_proxy_email_password &amp;&amp; echo

cat &lt;&lt;-EOF &gt; /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf
    root=${gmail_proxy_email_address}
    AuthUser=${gmail_proxy_email_address}
    AuthPass=${gmail_proxy_email_password}
    hostname=${HOSTNAME:-$(hostname)}
    mailhub=smtp.gmail.com:587
    rewriteDomain=gmail.com
    FromLineOverride=YES
    UseTLS=YES
    UseSTARTTLS=YES
EOF
</code></pre>

<p>The first thing I thought when I saw this was: "Why are there so many classes in one file?". The first thing I would do is split this code up into multiple files. (Such as: the piece classes should go into their own file). Next thing: Use:</p>

<pre><code>if __name__ == "__main__":
</code></pre>

<p>to start it. The way it is now, if someone imported it as a module, it would run. The if <strong>name</strong> == "<strong>main</strong>": makes sure that the code only runs if the actual file is run.</p>

<p>Also: use PEP-8. </p>

<p>Just throwing in my $00.02 here.</p>

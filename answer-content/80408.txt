<p>Can you explain what you do with the <em>data</em> from the Ajax call ? It seems to me that it is replaced by the <em>data</em> of the JSON since you named both variables the same.</p>

<p>Aside from that :</p>

<ul>
<li>You use jQuery, so you can use its selectors, no need to use getElementById</li>
<li>No need to do <em>var i = 0</em> and then again in the for loop. I think the declaration in the loop is enough</li>
<li>You don't seem to use the variables <em>color</em> and <em>time</em> anywhere else than in the line just after the condition to set them, so there is no need to store those informations, you can directly update the <em>content</em> value in the if you currently use to set <em>time</em> and <em>color</em></li>
</ul>

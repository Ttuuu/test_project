<p>Since this is a lot of code, this answer might expand over time or leave parts to other capable members of this community.</p>

<h2>Style</h2>

<p>Your overall style is quite good. You seem to follow most of the guidelines presented in the official <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Style Guide for Python Code</a> (the infamous PEP8). However, there are a few things that might need a little tweaking.</p>

<p>The thing that caught my attention in the first place where all those <code>_List</code> and <code>_Boolean</code> suffixes on variable an function names. They are very, very uncommon to be seen in any serious Python code. Usually you would choose your variable name to be as explicit as possible about its content, but care less about the type. If you really wanted to use "typing", Python 3 now offers so called <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">type hints</a> as a "standard" way to convey type information to users and tools. So instead of <code>def are_multi_lines_w_nations_Boolean(list):</code> you would have <code>def are_multi_lines_w_nations(list_: list) -&gt; bool:</code>. The keen observer will see that I also changed the parameter name from <code>list</code> to <code>list_</code>. This is because <code>list</code> is the typename of Python's built-in <code>list</code> type (think <code>[]</code>). There are other names like this that should be avoided, e.g <code>input</code>, <code>file</code>, and <code>open</code> to name a few.</p>

<p>In addition, your code code use some documentation. There is a section about these so called <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#documentation-strings" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation strings or docstrings</a> for short in the style guide. They are basically short descriptions of what your functions do <code>"""enclosed in triple quotes"""</code> immediately after <code>def function_name(...):</code> or <code>class ClassName:</code>. Especially if the code becomes even more complex you will be grateful for any hint your IDE can give you about the code you have written a month ago. Following the style as recommended in the Style Guide (and basically found everywhere in Python code) will allow not just Python's built-in <code>help(...)</code> to pick up your doc, but also most of the IDEs. This documentation might also be used to convey type information to the user.</p>

<p>Another stylistic choice to take is how to format long lists and dictionaries in a consistent way. You have several:</p>

<p>The long one:</p>

<pre><code>nations_List = ["Arstotzka", "Antegria", "Impor", "Kolechia", "Obristan", "Republia", "United Federation"]
</code></pre>

<p>Multiline, starting on the same line with the first element:</p>

<pre><code>self.documents_names = ["passport",
                        "ID card",
                        "access permit",
                        "work pass",
                        ...]
</code></pre>

<p>Multiline, starting the overall list on the next line:</p>

<pre><code>documents_List = \
    ["passport",
     "ID card",
     "access permit",
     ...]
</code></pre>

<p>Multiline, opening and closing brackets on seperate lines:</p>

<pre><code>self.documents_dict = {
    "passport": [],
    "ID_card": [],
    "access_permit": [],
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>However you choose, it's best to stick with one of them. Over time I have come to the conclusion that I like the last one best.</p>

<p>The good news is: there are a lot of tools out there that can help you to keep a consistent style even in larger projects. They start at tools like <a href="http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">flake8</a> and <a href="https://pylint.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pylint</a> which can basically perform style checking on your code. The next step are tools like <a href="https://github.com/google/yapf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">yapf</a> or <a href="https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">black</a> that can even auto-format your code while you write it. pylint or more specialised tools like <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">mypy</a> can also perform static code analysis to judge program complexity and look e.g. for type hints and the like.</p>

<h2>The code</h2>

<p>The code itself has some serious tendency to do deep nesting. IIRC, the most extreme case was like <strong>ten</strong> (10!) levels deep. Your class also has a significant number of lines of code (around 600). Where about ~220 of them are the taken up by the parser of the daily bulletin. It might be worth to consider moving the whole bulletin parsing ouf of <code>Inspector</code> into a separate class which is then used by the <code>Inspector</code>.</p>

<p>Other than that, there is quite a bit of code repetition. Especially the list of nations is repeated a lot. You should put them into "constants" right at th beginning of the file and use them where appropriate, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>OUR_GREAT_NATION = "Arstotzka"

FOREIGN_NATIONS = (
    "Antegria", "Impor", "Kolechia", "Obristan", "Republia",
    "United Federation"
)

ALL_NATIONS = (OUR_GREAT_NATION, ) + FOREIGN_NATIONS

# ... later
for nation in ALL_NATIONS:
    if nation in line:
        return line
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I used a tuple because they are immutable. This prevents you from doing things like <code>ALL_NATIONS[0] = "Foo"</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>That's all for now. Maybe I can spare some time tomorrow to talk a little bit more about some specific details.</p>

<p>You should use an ENUM or a class for the list of commands.</p>

<p>E.G:</p>

<pre><code>public ENUM Command
{
    private String value;

    SUMMON("Summon"),
    ATTACK("Attack"),
    HEAL("Heal")

    public Command(String value) { this.value = value; };
}

// String cmd = Commands.valueOf(sc.next());
// if (cmd == Command.HEAL) ...
// ( Or better yet, use a switch statement)
</code></pre>

<p>You should also be dealing with invalid input. (E.g in the default of the switch).</p>

<p>You've mentioned Magic the gathering, but your class name is Yugioh. As we all know, those are two very different games.</p>

<p>The variable 'health' is declared twice, I don't think the name makes sense for 'Summon'. </p>

<p>The case for 'Heal' looks overly complicated. You shouldn't need to create a 'newQueue'. Try to take away X amount of health for each item (either using a for-loop or lambdas). No need to re-order the queue.</p>

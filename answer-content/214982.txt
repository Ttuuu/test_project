<p>Inside the <code>while n_c == 1:</code> loop, is <code>b</code> constant?  If <code>b in primes</code> is false, does it make sense to even bother entering the <code>while n_c == 1:</code> loop?  And if it is prime before entering the loop, does it make sense to test if it is true every iteration of that loop?  Avoid wasting time by moving invariant expressions and conditions out of loops!</p>

<p>Your first two while loops would be better written as <code>for variable in range(lower_limit, upper_limit+1):</code></p>

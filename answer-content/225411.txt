<ul>
<li><p>If you are going to use a prepared statement (please do) then go the extra step of using placeholders and bound parameters. Your queries are not currently stable/secure.</p></li>
<li><p>If you don't truly need <code>Property_No</code> for anything, just return <code>COUNT</code> from your first query, and evaluate that value as a boolean (loose truthy comparison).  This is cleaner and more deliberate, I reckon.</p></li>
<li><p>Your code is suffering from excessive tabbing (aka "arrowhead" code). This increases the likelihood that you or future devs will need to tediously scroll horizontally to review/manage the code.</p></li>
<li><p>If all of the conditions must be true to reach the INSERT query, then just use one condition statement with the expressions separated by <code>&amp;&amp;</code>.</p></li>

<p>The cross product of two vectors is perpendicular to both vectors, unless both vectors are parallel. So you could simply take the cross product of your first vector with <code>(1, 0, 0)</code>, unless it is parallel to <code>(1, 0, 0)</code>, in which case you could use <code>(0, 1, 0)</code>. If you use lists rather than dedicated classes with attributes and are willing to use numpy, this gets ridiculously short:</p>

<pre><code>import numpy as np

def perpendicular_vector(v):
    if v[1] == 0 and v[2] == 0:
        if v[0] == 0:
            raise ValueError('zero vector')
        else:
            return np.cross(v, [0, 1, 0]]
    return np.cross(v, [1, 0, 0])
</code></pre>
    </div>

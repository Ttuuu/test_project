<li><p>You may wish to revisit the web-application concept: it is simple to forward a Windows Kerberos authentication to a website; all major browsers support it. If your organization has computers joined to Active Domain, the authentication is pretty much already done for you. See for example <a href="https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/5-12-x/topics/cdh_sg_browser_access_kerberos_protected_url.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this page</a> for details of browser configuration. The web server can use e.g. <a href="https://github.com/modauthgssapi/mod_auth_gssapi" rel="nofollow noreferrer">mod_auth_gssapi</a> module to accept Kerberos authentication forwarded by the user's browser. It can also fall back to manual user + password authentication. The web server can <a href="https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Authenticating_Apache_against_Active_Directory" rel="nofollow noreferrer">leverage an Active Domain for authentication</a>.</p></li>

<p>Some comments here are inspired by below line:</p>

<p><code>Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute. â€” Abelson and Sussman</code></p>

<ul>
<li><p>When I first looked at the code, first thing I could not stop appreciating was avoiding the ternary operator. Using <code>if</code> makes it easier to setup correct expectations on what is happening without extra attention.</p></li>
<li><p><code>'Select All'</code> is a CONSTANT which is deciding the method output. So, my suggestion is to move it to the top of the method and assign to a variable.</p></li>
<li><p>When the code contains conditional execution, having a single place that consumes the result of different blocks would be good choice. I see in your second block of code you made that change. <code>$scope.emailList = emailListUpdate;</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>$scope.emailList = _.reject($scope.emailList, item =&gt; item._id === user._id);</code> I review lot of code internally. No way I would accept code like this. It's not about how smartly we can write code, it's about how easy it is for others to understand. Separate the logic from return statements. Give it a meaningful name to convey what it is and why are you filtering.</p></li>
<li><p><code>$scope.users.filter(user =&gt; !user.report.emailed)</code> is smart! But <code>$scope.users.filter((user) =&gt; { return user.report.emailed === false })</code> is easier to understand what's happening.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
I am curious to understand why my answer deserve negative vote. Someone please take a minute to help me understand.</p>

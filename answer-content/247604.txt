<h1>Whitespace Following Code Blocks</h1>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#:%7E:text=Use%20blank%20lines%20in%20functions,related%20sections%20of%20your%20file." rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python style guide</a>, you should use whitespace sparingly. Try aiming for one single line between functions and code blocks.</p>
<h1>Unclear Function Naming</h1>
<p><code>main_func()</code> is not a very clear function name. As a developer reading the code, I am unsure as to what this function contains.</p>
<p>For a solution to this problem, read the next section:</p>
<h1>Single-Responsibility Principle</h1>
<p>Instead of grouping all of the main game code into <code>main_func()</code>, figure out blocks of code that have a single responsibility, and refactor them into their own function.</p>
<p>For example, the start of <code>main_func()</code> contains code to choose a word. You could refactor this into a <code>choose_word()</code> function that takes the list of words. From this point, you might choose to not pass <code>word_lst</code> into <code>main_func</code>, but instead the chosen word as a result of the <code>choose_word()</code> function.</p>
<p>As another example, further into your <code>main_func()</code> function, you may choose to refactor the "check" code (to see if the player has correctly guessed the word) into a <code>check_guess()</code> function.</p>
<h1>Parameter Naming</h1>
<p>I am not sure if this is just a typo or a stylistic choice, but you should rename <code>word_lst</code> to <code>word_list</code>. In this example, other developers (and possibly yourself in future) will be able to figure out that <code>lst</code> == <code>list</code>, but some words may not be so obvious. Try not to shorten words when naming variables parameters.</p>

<p>congratulations on writing a fairly clear, readable function! (And welcome!)</p>

<p><strong>What types do you take?</strong></p>

<p>You explicitly check for an instance of type <code>list</code>. I think you should invert your check, and look for a string type instead. The reason is that it would enable you to accept iterables other than <code>list</code> as your errors.</p>

<p>For example, you would be able to do something like:</p>

<pre><code>add_error(edict, 'key', (str(e) for e in ...))
</code></pre>

<p>That last parameter is not a <code>list</code>, but it <em>is</em> something you might want to do. Also, <code>*args</code> is not a list but a tuple - you might want to splat a tuple rather than converting it to a list first.</p>

<p><strong>What types do you take?</strong></p>

<p>Your <code>key</code> parameter is always tested as a string. But dicts can have other key-types than string, and you neither test those, nor do you appear to have coded any kind of rejection on that basis. I suggest you add some tests that demonstrate your intent: is it okay to use non-strings as keys, or not?</p>

<p><strong>What constraints exist on the errors?</strong></p>

<p>I don't see any indication of what happens when duplicate errors are added. Is this intended to be allowed, or not?</p>

<p><strong>What constraints exist on the keys?</strong></p>

<p>Is it okay to use <code>None</code> as a key? How about <code>''</code> (empty string)? Tests, please.</p>

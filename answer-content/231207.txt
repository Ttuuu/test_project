<p>What is wrong with simple code like?:</p>

<pre><code>distances &lt;- adist(candidates, target)
candidates[distances == min(distances)]
</code></pre>

<p>This is shorter and, in my opinion, easier to read, as it do not require any knowledge of additional packages.</p>

<p>Also, you mentioned that your data is small and it looks like you are working with vectors, in that case I do not see a point to use <code>data.frame</code>, <code>dplyr</code> etc.</p>

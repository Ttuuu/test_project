<p><a href="http://jsperf.com/flatten-an-array-loop-vs-reduce">Here</a> is the performance test for these two and couple more approaches (one suggested by @elclanrs in the comments).</p>

<p>The performance differences will vary significantly across different browsers, and even different version on same browser, as browser these days try to optimize javascript very aggressively. </p>

<p>Unless you are dealing with very large arrays or this operation is performed repeatedly in quick succession, I would suggest you to use simplest and clearest approach. But, that being said the loop solution is also not that complex or big anyway (and it performs better than others especially on firefox)</p>

<p>User input shouldn't require the full case-sensitive text.</p>

<p>If there isn't already one in a library somewhere, write a function that compares two strings to see if one is a valid truncation of the other.
Then use that function rather than <code>!=</code> for comparing the response to the flip.</p>

<p>E.g. any of these should match "True": "t", "tr", "tru", and "true", regardless of case.</p>

<p>And users shouldn't have to respond so many times.  It gets annoying.
As "Falco" suggested, the input choices should be "Heads", "Tails", and "Quit".</p>

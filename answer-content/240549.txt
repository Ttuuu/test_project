<p>Welcome to Code Review. Here some suggestions for you :</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>LinkedHashMap&lt;String, String&gt; requestBody = HttpExchangeUtil.getRequestBodyAsMap(aExchange);
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Declare <code>requestBody</code> as <code>Map</code>, if you can choose always the most generic interface.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>try { //send your response 
} 
catch (NumberFormatException e) { 
  e.printStackTrace();
}
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Usually requests are logged using for example <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/logging/Logger.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Logger</a> saving them in a log file, so you can proceed with exam of requests and see eventually what's gone wrong.</p>

<p>It seems me from your code you have already clear the main concepts about web programming like sessions, these are my personal answers to your questions based on my experience:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For experienced web developers with a similar goal (i.e. something
  quick 'n' dirty which just manages to work), what would you have done
  similarly or differently?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Normally web java projects are based on existing complex frameworks, for me the best option is always rely on which framework is used for the project and model my service using just framework libraries if it is possible. What happens if your code work perfectly on your pc and not work within the framework?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you were aiming for something bigger, like a long-term project
  which would scale to a large number of users, and with new features
  continually being added, what would you have done differently?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Almost the same answer before, check which one well known framework has the characteristics you are looking for and use it from the start, avoid if possible all security problems and let the framework does its job. </p>

<p>Here are a few ideas about your code.</p>

<h2>Check for command line arguments</h2>

<p>The code fails with an exception if it's invoked with no command line arguments because it attempts to use <code>argv[1]</code> and there isn't any.  I'd suggest that it would be nice to print a "usage" message if the user enters either an invalid or no argument.</p>

<h2>Use a list comprehension</h2>

<p>List comprehensions are extremely useful and very Pythonic.  It's really good to become proficient with them.  Here's how to use one to generate a random IPv4 address:</p>

<pre><code>'.'.join([str(randint(0,255)) for x in range(4)])
</code></pre>

<p>And an IPv6 address is a little trickier because we need hex digits.</p>

<pre><code>':'.join([hex(randint(2**16,2**17))[-4:] for x in range(8)])
</code></pre>

<p>That works because <code>randint</code> generates a number in the range 0x10000 to 0x20000 and we then pick off the last four hex digits.</p>

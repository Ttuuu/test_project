<p>Let's sum up all the disparate suggestions from different answers. </p>

<ol>
<li>Globals are bad. Pass a connection variable as a function parameter.</li>
<li>Such a staircase of conditional operators is a sign of bad design.</li>
<li>Checking a statement for the error but doing nothing when it happens is an awful practice. Looks like you are trying to avoid getting the error message, but error messages in fact are your friends, not does! Always get as much error information as possible, <em>it will help you to fix it!</em></li>
<li>Writing such a wall of code to perform a single primitive SQL query is just <strong>INSANE</strong></li>
<li><a href="https://phpdelusions.net/mysqli/error_reporting" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Tell mysqli to throw exceptions on errors</a>. </li>
</ol>

<p>Then have a tidy function like this</p>

<pre><code>function getPaymentMethodName($mysqli, $id) {
    $stmt = $mysqli-&gt;prepare( 'SELECT name FROM `payment_methods` WHERE id = ?');
    $stmt-&gt;bind_param( 'i', $id );
    $stmt-&gt;execute();
    $stmt-&gt;bind_result($name);
    $stmt-&gt;fetch();
    $stmt-&gt;close;
    return $name;
}
</code></pre>
    </div>

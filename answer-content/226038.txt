<p>I have some style and organization comments to add to @dfhwze 's previous answer about performance and style.</p>

<p>For <code>ListNode</code> class, I would expect <code>val</code> and <code>next</code> to be named <code>Value</code> and <code>Next</code>.  I would also rather see them be properties instead of fields.  And for some reason, I am expecting to see a <code>Previous</code> property as well.</p>

<p>I see nothing in the exercise description that says you must create your own implementation of a linked list.  Granted, I didn't want to create an account to login to LeetCode.  </p>

<p>If the exercise was to create your own linked list, then I would want to see 2 different classes.  One would be the <code>ListNode</code> for individual nodes.  The other would be a <code>LinkedList</code>, which is a collection of <code>ListNode</code>.  Then the method in the <code>HasCycleClass</code> could be moved as a member to <code>LinkedList</code>.  As you have it, it feels awkward to have the <code>HasCycleClass</code> where it is.</p>

<p>If the exercise was simply to create an efficient <code>HasCycle</code> method, I would prefer to see you use .NET's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.linkedlist-1?view=netframework-4.8#methods" rel="noreferrer">LinkedList</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.linkedlistnode-1?view=netframework-4.8" rel="noreferrer">LinkedListNode</a> classes.</p>

<p>In summary, I would really prefer to see something about individual nodes as well as a collection of them.  Your implementation does not make such a distinction.</p>

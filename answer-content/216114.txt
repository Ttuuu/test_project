<p>Read about Alan Turing a very fascinating man - the very first computer scientist, if you will. In his quest to break every single message sent from the German Enigma Machine he realized there are so many possibilities that it would take over 20,000 years to test each one daily.</p>

<p>Taking this approach to your tic-tac-toe game:</p>

<ul>
<li>There are only eight possibilities to a win.</li>
<li>There must be 'Three in  a row' to be a win.</li>
</ul>

<p>If there is no win -- there is no loser either.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We have no reason to test for a win until at least one player has three marks on the board.</p></li>
<li><p>If we test 0,0 for 'empty' and it is indeed empty, we can eliminate three of the possibilities -- leaving only five.</p></li>
<li><p>if we test 1,1 for empty, and it too is empty, we can eliminate two more possibilities, leaving only three to be tested.</p></li>
<li><p>If we test 2,2 for empty and it too is empty, we can eliminate the remaining three possibilities.</p></li>
<li><p>However, if we come across a square that is not empty - then we only need to test the possibilities associated to that particular square - not all eight.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>But again, we have no reason to test until a possible win is even possible - so until one player had three turns there is no need to test for a win. 
We can test any of the three spaces in any one diagonal - just use the same diagonal for all three though.</p>

<p>Using this approach, we only test three spaces to determine if a win is possible, and only after the first player's third turn. If that first player wins after four turns we only actually test some possible solutions two times.</p>

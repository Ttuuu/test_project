<p>@MartinR's answer is good, but I disagree on the choice of returning a list of strings. They should be maintained as <code>long</code> until the output stage. The return type can be made</p>

<pre><code>public static List&lt;Long&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>which, if you set <code>prefixes</code> to be a <code>List&lt;Long&gt;</code>, requires that the call to <code>String.valueOf</code> be removed.</p>

<p>In your <code>main</code> method, the rest of the code does not need to change. The advantage of leaving this as <code>Long</code> is that if you ever need to do further processing, it's much easier.</p>

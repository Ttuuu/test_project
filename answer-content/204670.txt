<h1>Prefer standard headers</h1>
<p><code>&lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;</code> isn't in any standard; even on those platforms where it exists, it's probably a poor choice if it includes the whole of the Standard Library.  Instead, include (only) the standard library headers that declare the types that are required for the header.</p>
<h1>Avoid <code>using namespace std;</code></h1>
<p>Bringing all names in from a namespace is problematic; <code>namespace std</code> particularly so. See <a href="//stackoverflow.com/q/1452721">Why is “using namespace std” considered bad practice?</a>.</p>
<h1>Prefer C++ standard headers</h1>
<p>Instead of <code>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</code>, it's better to include <code>&lt;cstdlib&gt;</code>, so that standard library names are consistently declared in the <code>std</code> namespace, away from your own identifiers (though, at a first glance, I don't see where you need this particular header).</p>
<hr>
<p>Now to the implementation of <code>luckBalance()</code>.  One thing we can observe here is that we only ever use <code>i</code> to iterate through the elements of <code>contests</code>; that's a good indication that we can use a range-based <code>for</code> loop.  Since we only read from <code>contests[i]</code> (and never write), we can use a const reference (and should have accepted a reference to const vector as function argument):</p>
<pre><code>for (const auto&amp; contest: contests) {
    if (contest[1] == 1) {
        totalLostLuck += contest[0];
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p>(This is a partial review; I intend to return and complete it later).</p>

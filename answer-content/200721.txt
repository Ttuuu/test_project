<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>How many <code>.text-fit</code> elements are there in the document? If there are many, then the first thing I'd do would remove adding the wrapper div dynamically, and instead put it into the HTML from the start.</p>

<p>Then, you are unnecessarily looking up the wrapper element in each loop. Just save an reference to the element before the loop and use that.</p>

<pre><code>var w = currentElement.find('.wrapper');
while (w.innerHeight() &gt; currentElement.innerHeight()) {
  // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Next, consider getting rid of jQuery. It's huge and slow and in most modern browsers it doesn't do much that you couldn't do directly on the DOM. </p>

<p>Finally the biggest problem is starting with the font size of 999px. I tried starting with the more reasonable 99px and that sped up the process considerably. If you actually need the text to be that big, you may want to try with a different step size other than 1px. For example, if you'd use a binary search, it will be much faster.</p>

<ul>
<li>You need to run your UI text through a spell checker. Example - <code>exsiting</code></li>
<li>Since each player has more than one attribute (<code>total_score</code>, <code>points</code>, <code>password</code>, etc.) each player should be represented by a class, or at least a <code>namedtuple</code>.</li>
<li>You have a <code>print</code> followed by a blank <code>input("")</code>. Don't do this; just put the content of the print into the prompt argument of the input call.</li>
<li><code>while ens != ("e") and ens != ("n") and ens != ("s")</code> should be something like <code>while ens not in ('e', 'n', 's'):</code></li>
<li>Rather than bare <code>open</code>/<code>close</code> calls, you should use a proper <code>with</code> statement.</li>
<li>Rather than using a half a dozen <code>write</code> calls, consider just issuing one <code>write</code> call with a multi-line (triple-quoted) string.</li>
<li>Something like <code>"username: " + username1 + " password: " + password</code> is better done with a <code>format</code> call.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other than that, you really need to strengthen your DRY (don't repeat yourself) skills. Writing a handful of functions for repeated code would be a good start.</p>

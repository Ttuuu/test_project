<p>I think its not appropriate to call it Factory pattern. Most people refer to <strong>Factory Method Pattern</strong> as <strong>Factory Pattern</strong>. I have seen some references where its called as <strong>Simple Factory Pattern</strong> to clearly distinguish the two. Also its not a GOF pattern. </p>

<p>You can use different approaches but idea is that you are creating objects based on some parameter. In one case i had used reflection to implement <strong>Simple Factory Pattern</strong> because i had around 100 odd classes so putting if/else would have been a daunting task. </p>

<pre><code>  String  qualifiedClassName = "Library1"; //fully qualified class name
  Library library = (Library) Class.forName(qualifiedClassName).newInstance(); 
  library.execute();  //call method after creating object
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Library</strong> class is super class and <strong>Library1</strong> is one of the sub class.</p>

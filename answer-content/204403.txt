<p>I don't know why you didn't clear the coding challenge. It looks mostly alright. </p>

<p>There's a couple of things I think could be improved:</p>

<ul>
<li>getSortedData mutates the tableData. Only setState should be able to mutate state.</li>
<li>getSortedData has hard-coded the column names. Table was supposed to have dynamic columns. You could have solved this by sending in either custom sorter predicates or adding on a dataType property to each column definition.</li>
</ul>
    </div>

<p>A few things in your code seem redundant (Most of these have been remarked well by previous answers) - Although perhaps I am missing some specific reasons for your choices and its also good to remember there are tonnes of answers for programming questions - This is my take on your functionality aim:</p>
<pre><code>import random
import inflect

p = inflect.engine()

while True:
    confirmation = input("Would you like to roll some dice?(y/n) &gt; ")
    if confirmation == "y":
        while True:
            count = input("How many dice would you like to roll? &gt; ")
            if len(count) == 0:
                print("Error! Please input something!")
            elif not count.isnumeric():
                print("Error! You may only input numbers")
            else:
                [print("The " + p.number_to_words(p.ordinal(i)) + " die rolled a: " 
                       + str(random.randint(1, 6))) for i in range(1, int(count))]
                break
    elif confirmation == "n":
        print("No dice have been rolled")
    else:
        print("Error! Only y and n are valid") if len(confirmation) &gt; 1 else print("Error! You may only input one character")

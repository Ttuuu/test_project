<p>This template is either unusable or would make you write HTML in the business logic part  spoiling the whole idea.</p>

<p>A template engine is a more complex application than people often think. There is always a <em>presentation logic</em> that could be quite complex. Which means a template must support programming statements. At least loops and conditions. Without them, it will be almost unusable.</p>

<p>Imagine you need to list 10 posts an a blog. How it could be done in your template? Going to add all the HTML formatting to variables before assigning them? Really?</p>

<p>So, such a simple template could be made viable only by letting PHP to interpret the template. So it could be like</p>

<pre><code>public function render($template, $variables = []) {
    array_merge($this-&gt;variables, $variables);
    extract($variables)
    ob_start();
    include $template;
    return ob_get_clean();
}
</code></pre>

<p>this way you will be able to use full featured templates that will contain all the logic needed for the presentation of your data.</p>
    </div>

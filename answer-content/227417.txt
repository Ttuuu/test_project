<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>Not a problem in terms of functionality (seems to have been covered pretty well already) but in terms of clarity/readability:</p>

<h3>Misleading name <code>get_penultimate</code></h3>

<p>It appears to functionally be <code>get_last</code> (<code>get_ultimate</code>, if you will), so there is a clear mismatch between this name and the implemented functionality. The functionality makes sense, so the name appears to be wrong.<br>
To explicitly point out the mismatch: <em>penultimate</em> means <em>second to last</em>.</p>

<h2>A comment on the DDL</h2>
<p>Despite this using MySQL (which would never be my first choice), the schema seems pretty sane; good job. This surprised me:</p>
<pre><code>removed_date date default null
</code></pre>
<p>but then, reading the <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/data-type-defaults.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>, MySQL does a nonsensical thing by default and uses the "zero" value for a date as its default; so what you've done is correct.</p>
<p>For these two columns:</p>
<pre><code>_from date not null,
_to date not null,
</code></pre>
<p>If you didn't want an underscore, you can instead use <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2889871/how-do-i-escape-reserved-words-used-as-column-names-mysql-create-table">quote escaping</a>.</p>
<p>For columns like these:</p>
<pre><code>removed boolean default false,
</code></pre>
<p>you should consider making them <code>not null</code>.</p>
<h2>User table</h2>
<pre><code>insert into users
(name, password, access_level_id, creation_date)
VALUES
    ('root', '123321a', 2, curdate());
</code></pre>
<p>First of all, you should be able to make the current date the default for <code>creation_date</code> so that you don't actually need to specify it in the <code>insert</code>. Second and certainly the most concerning thing I see in all of this code is what appears to be a plain-text password. Never, ever, ever, ever put a plaintext password in a database. I implore to you have a careful read through <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7270526/how-do-you-securely-store-a-users-password-and-salt-in-mysql">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7270526/how-do-you-securely-store-a-users-password-and-salt-in-mysql</a> ,  or similar articles, noting that some suggest MD5 which should be avoided due to cryptographic weakness. It is crucial to hash and salt passwords.</p>

  <li>Why are these two so different in speed? Casting as String was much faster:</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>The cast is just a type check (1 or 2 JVM instructions), as <code>iter.next()</code>'s type should be String.  The toString() call just does <code>return this;</code>, so it should be fast too.  Actually, you can just write:</p>

<pre><code>String current = iter.next();
</code></pre>

<p>Correction: you could if you change the line to:</p>

<pre><code>Iterator&lt;String&gt; iter = allCombos.iterator();
</code></pre>

  <li>Is there a better data structure for the dictionary than an ArrayList? If so, why?</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Use a Set.  Using an ArrayList, your check time is O(n).  With a TreeSet, check time is O(log(n)).  With a HashSet, check time is O(1).  If you use HashSet, set the initial capacity correctly.  (After all, in your case, you know how many items you are putting in it.)</p>

<p>I think this code is a <strong>very good example</strong> of how to write fluent APIs, even though there exists far easier ways to get an certain array.</p>

<p>flaws of the fluent interface:</p>

<p>you should let the the user be in choice in having the order of min/max   <code>createArray().ofIntegers().ofLength(15).withMinimum(-10).withMaximum(20);</code>
<code>createArray().ofIntegers().ofLength(15).withMaximum(20).withMinimum(-10);</code> </p>

<p>The idea of the fluent interface is indeed to guide the user input. That's done very well with your code, but sometimes you have to provide a loose order. This is harder to implement but makes the user-experience wayyys better. Since your code is an academical question, I would be happy to see such an implementation!!! </p>

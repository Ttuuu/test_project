  <p>One point I could think of would be to use "long long" instead of only "long" since this algorithm is used in cryptography and should thus be suited for very large integers.</p>

<p><em>Very large integers</em> means using GMP or a similar library, not using <code>long long</code>. Although if you're using GMP then you might as well use <code>mpz_jacobi</code>.</p>

<p>This may be controversial, but in my opinion all new C code should use the types from <code>stdint.h</code> unless forced to use less specific types for interoperability with legacy code.</p>

<pre><code>        a = a % n;
</code></pre>

<p>This is buggy. The first time this is executed, <code>a</code> might be negative, but the rest of the algorithm requires <code>a</code> to be non-negative. As a test case consider <code>jacobi(-1, 3)</code>.</p>

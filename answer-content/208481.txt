<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>def main():
    k = 21
    listA=[10,11,3,7]
    print (k,' = '," + ".join([str(i and e) for i in listA for e in listA if k==(i+e)]))

main()
</code></pre>

<p>This minor change to your code will do what you're after.  Put a <code>" + ".join( )</code> around your list creator and cast the <code>(i and e)</code> items to <code>str</code>, that will then join all string elements in the list together into a string with <code>+</code> as the separator (there are spaces in there, yes, and this is necessary to get the output you're after).</p>

<p>Note I also made a change to add spaces around the equals sign, indentation, and extra spacing for readability, as well as indentation standardization (4 spaces for a single indentation level).</p>

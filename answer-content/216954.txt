<p>I'm going to assume that you borrowed code from <a href="http://usingpython.com/python-rpg-game/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this page on usingpython.com</a> in order to make this because of the dictionary and the <code>move = input("").lower().split()</code>. No shame in that, it's a useful site. I use it too. Try instead of if item in room and if enemy in room, try if a enemy is in the room. So if a enemy is in the room, then it would display game over if a enemy is in the room, meaning you dont have to add extra items into a room</p>

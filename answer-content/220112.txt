<p><strong>Here are some minor suggestions relating to Java/programming standards etc:</strong></p>

<p><code>ConditionChecker</code> Might not be a good name as it's not very descriptive. However you should be able to remove this entirely as the two methods are very simple and you don't really need a method for either of them.</p>

<p>Negative names such as <code>checkIfCharactersAreUnequal</code> can lead to double negatives. For example, to check if the characters are unequal you'd have to check if they are not unequal. I'd suggest either refactoring the method, or removing it entirely since it simply checks if two characters are equal.</p>

<p><code>checkIfIndexEqualsToLengthOfLineGivenByUser</code> 
If you ever use this method to check a different String, you'd have to rename the method. When naming public methods, you should only think in terms of the method itself. In other words, the ConditionCheckerService class doesn't care if it's a String given by the user or not. Also try to use explanatory names, instead of <code>check</code> use <code>is</code>. For example, <code>isIndexEqualToLength(int, String)</code></p>

<p><code>KeyBoardTeacherEngine</code> 
<code>startKeyboardTeacherEngine</code> should be public. Currently it's in the same package as the calling method <code>Main</code>, but I don't think it actually relates to Main.</p>

<p><strong>General suggestions:</strong></p>

<p>Consider having the user able to select the path of the file via a 'file chooser'. Example being that File Explorer like window that pops up to allow the user to select a location.</p>

<p>Instead of displaying the index of the failed character, display the failed line with a '^' underneath the unlatching character.</p>

<p>Different modes, such as allowing the user to make mistakes but keeping a record throughout the duration of the test, and printing the results at the end. You could look at online typing tests for ideas.</p>

<p>In your console: <code>Provide path of the file in which we can find text for the game(if the file is in the project folder, then just write a name of the file) i.e tekst.txt</code></p>

<p>Change the example file name to "text.txt" or "file.txt"</p>

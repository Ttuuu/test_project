<p>Some suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rather than ask whether all the following expressions are going to be in Polish or infix notation, you can simply check whether the first non-parenthesis character is a number or an operator.</li>
<li><code>START_FOR_SYMBOLS</code> could be renamed to <a href="http://www.mathwords.com/i/identity_of_an_operation.htm" rel="nofollow"><code>OPERATION_IDENTITIES</code></a> for mathematical clarity.</li>
</ul>

<p>Open issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why <code>doctest.testmod()</code> on every run?</li>
<li>There isn't always a unique innermost parenthesis, for example in the case of <code>(1 + 2) * (3 + 4)</code>. You probably want to return a list and process each of them in turn.</li>
</ul>

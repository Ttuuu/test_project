<p>You could use delegates here where you have </p>

<pre><code>public delegate bool Comparator(T a,T b);
</code></pre>

<p>This would replace</p>

<pre><code>public HeapType MinOrMax { get; private set; }
</code></pre>

<p>The user would pass in a function that compares the 2 objects and returns a true or false</p>

<pre><code> if (comparator.Invoke(items[i],items[(i - 1) / 2]))
</code></pre>

<p>this would allow anything about these 2 objects to be tested and then a result to be returned based on this decision. This would make it more fluid, but of course this may be more complicated than needed for some uses.</p>

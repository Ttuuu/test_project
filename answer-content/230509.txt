<p>There isn't a lot I see that can be improved; nevertheless:</p>

<h2>Initialization vs. execution</h2>

<p>Your <code>clientController::init</code> is misnamed. It does both initialization as well as running the main application loop. It'd probably better if you separated those two functions. This code:</p>

<pre><code>//**** This is the part responsible for connecting the signals and slots for the View and the Model.
        connect(window.ui.connectButton, &amp;QPushButton::clicked, &amp;data, &amp;clientModel::connect);
        connect(&amp;data, &amp;clientModel::writeTextSignal, &amp;window, &amp;clientView::writeTextToScreen);
</code></pre>

<p>should go in the constructor if possible; then <code>execute</code> would only do:</p>

<pre><code>    window.show();
    return app.exec();
</code></pre>
    </div>

<p>There is not much code so I won't write much review</p>

<p>The issue that makes me most uneasy is the interface decision, specifically requiring calling code to calculate len in bytes.</p>

<p>If I am in "trying my best mode" as a coder, late at night with a stressful customer deadline hanging over me, it'll be all I can manage to remember to clear memory. I will inevitably try to clear an int array of 8 elements with <code>ERASE_STATE(arr, 8)</code>. If I am lucky I will remember to use 32 and add a comment about the 4x8 calculation. I am unlikely to remember to account for the fact that other architectures could have a 16 or 64 bit int.</p>

<p>I would very much prefer a macro that took care of the type sizes for me and left the interface as passing the the natural array size. </p>

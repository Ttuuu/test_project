<h3>w3fools</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>following a W3 tutorial</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would say the most important suggestion you can get is never ever use any tutorial from w3shcools. They are dubbed as "w3fools" for a reason. Their tutorials are outdated, buggy and - as you can already see from other answers - far from being optimal making you a monkey writing a lot of useless code that repeats again and again.</p>
<h3>IP address detection jiggery-pokery</h3>
<p>Any <code>$_SERVER</code> array element that begins from <code>HTTP_</code> is filled directly form the HTTP header. It means that <em>to spoof it is a no-brainier</em> at all.</p>
<p>You have two code blocks that effectively fill the IP address from the user input, instead of taking it from the hardware protocol. You have to <strong>get rid of the second code block completely</strong>, and make <strong>the first one unconditional</strong>. Just make your mind whether your code is behind Cloudfare or not, and either add <code>HTTP_CF_CONNECTING_IP</code> processing or leave <code>REMOTE_ADDR</code> alone accordingly.</p>
<p>Just learn from this educational story, <a href="https://blog.ircmaxell.com/2012/11/anatomy-of-attack-how-i-hacked.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">How I hacked Stack Overflow</a> and never step on this rake again.</p>
<p>Other issues such as wrong error reporting, double connection and overall inefficiency are already reviewed in other excellent answers.</p>

<h1>Indentation</h1>

<p>It's in some places, but in the places it's not in, it's pretty bad.</p>

<p>You should always make sure your code is indented so, when looking over your code, you can see what goes where.</p>

<p>For example, your <code>Start</code> function has bad indentation. Generally, all function code between the signature and the <code>end</code> keyword of the function should have <strong>at least</strong> one indent (more if there are other structures like <code>if</code>)</p>

<p>How the beginning <code>Start</code> function should look:</p>

<pre><code>function Start(xDirection)
    Busy = true
    if Open or IsOpening then
        repeat DoorClose(Floor.Value) wait(0.1) until Closed == true and IsOpening == false
    end

    ...
</code></pre>

<p>Also, I'm not sure if this is just personal preference, but you have a lot of "one-liners". By that, I mean that in a lot of places, you tend to try to put things on one line. While this does make your code look a bit more tidy, it might be harder for someone else to read it (or maybe even you, if you stepped away from the code for a while)</p>

<p>For example, I would change this line:</p>

<pre><code>Car:FindFirstChild("DoorOpen").ClickDetector.MouseClick:connect(function() if not FireLock then DoorOpen(Floor.Value) end end)
</code></pre>

<p>To:</p>

<pre><code>Car:FindFirstChild("DoorOpen").ClickDetector.MouseClick:connect(function()
    if not FireLock then
        DoorOpen(Floor.Value)
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Other than that, your code is very difficult to read, making it hard for people to give you a good review. Since this is a lot of code, I recommend finding an online program that can indent your LUA for you, as if you did it by hand, it could take a long time.</p>

<li>It reads like <code>list.cmp</code> is required to be initialized, otherwise <code>genListSearchNode</code> is not meaningful. In that case, I would suggest checking <code>cmp</code>'s value in function <code>genListNew</code>. If it is null, return a null ptr. Then in function <code>genListSearchNode</code>, we could have checked <code>list-&gt;cmp</code> as part of the parameter validations; exit early if <code>list-&gt;cmp</code> is <code>null</code>. </li>
<li>you may consider to include a <code>copy function</code> for node's data. Currently, the code is doing a shallow copy via <code>memcpy</code>. </li>
<li>In function <code>genListPopHead</code>, it sets <code>list-&gt;head = node-&gt;pNext</code> before <code>genListCopyNodeData</code> succeeds. If <code>genListCopyNodeData</code> fails then the list is mutated unintendedly. I would suggest swap the order so that make a copy first then change <code>list-&gt;head</code>. Also you would want to check <code>if(buf)</code> in this function. </li>
</ul>

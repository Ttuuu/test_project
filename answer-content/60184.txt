<p>You shouldn't throw Exception, create a custom Exception as proposed @Mat's Mug and throw that one instead, otherwise you might trap an exception you didn't want to trap (ex : <code>MyDatabaseJustExplodedException</code>)!</p>

<p>I'd add that it is never good to have as much lines of comment as you have lines of code! Basically, comments shouldn't explain <strong>what</strong> you are doing but <strong>why</strong> you are doing it. If you need to explain what you are doing, something is wrong with your code.</p>

<p>I think the only comment that is worth its place is this one<br>
<code>//So that View can stop execution if validity is false.</code></p>

<p>I would change <code>AttendanceValidity</code> to <code>IsAttendanceValid</code>, it is way more clear what your property is in charge of.</p>

<p>Finally, I don't think you should have braces around one liners if it is to put them on the same line as your code. What I mean is either do this :</p>

<pre><code>if (!validity) //changed by isValid as suggested @ckuhn203
{
    throw new Exception("Invalid Attendance. Already there is a matching attendance for this employee"); 
}
</code></pre>

<p>or this</p>

<pre><code>if (!validity) //changed by isValid as suggested @ckuhn203
    throw new Exception("Invalid Attendance. Already there is a matching attendance for this employee"); 
</code></pre>
    </div>

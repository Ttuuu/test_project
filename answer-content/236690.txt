<p>There's a bug in an edge case. If the very last move, the one that fills the board, also creates a winning row, there will be two announcements. To fix this, you have to <code>return</code> after the winner announcement.</p>

<p>Except from this, the code is really simple to read and understand. Checking for a winner is quite slow, and if you should ever need faster code, this is where you can gain performance. But until then I suggest to leave the code as it is. It is short, to the point and elegant.</p>

<p>If you want to make the code less redundant, you can define a helper function inside <code>checkWinner</code>:</p>

<pre><code>function checkWinner() {
    function fiveSame(start, step) {
        function same(i) {
            return board[start + i * step] === board[start];
        }
        return same(1) &amp;&amp; same(2) &amp;&amp; same(3) &amp;&amp; same(4);
    }

    for (const i in board) {
        if (fiveSame(i, 1) || fiveSame(i, width - 1) || fiveSame(i, width) || fiveSame(i, width + 1)) {
            ...
        }
    ...
}
</code></pre>
    </div>

</blockquote>

<p>You should ask if very large datasets are possible.  Because if they're not, clean code takes precedence over what would be a premature optimization.  All the code inside your <code>then</code> block can be replaced with a single line:</p>

<pre><code>json.data.filter(x =&gt; x.profile_path).slice(0, 4)
</code></pre>

<p>If performance is truly an issue, your basic thinking is correct, but I'd just use a for loop:</p>

<pre><code>let result = [];
let data = json.data
for (var i = 0; i &lt; data.length; i++) {
  if (data[i].profile_path) result.push(data[i])
  if (result.length == 4) return result
}
// ask interviewer what the behavior should be for incomplete results...
</code></pre>

<p>Note that returning inside a for loop will <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11714503/does-return-stop-a-loop">exit the function immediately</a>.</p>

<p>Fwiw, it sounds like the problem you faced was mostly about communication with the interviewer. Next time, politely probe them about what they're looking for, what their assumptions are about the problem, and so on.</p>

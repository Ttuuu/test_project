<p>A couple of remarks in addition to <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/217469/195179">Josiah's answer</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>While I agree that the variable names <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> are fine when implementing mathy functions that can be concisely described with these identifiers, this doesn't apply to the counter <code>s</code>. I am not totally sure what it does, but</p>

<pre><code>int s = 1; //Serial No.
</code></pre>

<p>makes me think that</p>

<pre><code>int serialNumber = 1;
</code></pre>

<p>would be a better approach.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to be consistent in your naming, you have some names that start with an upper case and some that start with a lower case. Instead, pick one scheme and stick to it.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep the scope of your variables as small as possible.</p>

<pre><code>int Fact1;
int Fact2;
int Fact3;
</code></pre>

<p>They can all be moved into the loop body and be initialized upon their declaration. This doesn't make the exist unitialized, which is desireable.</p></li>
<li><p>When you don't intend to modify a variable, <code>const</code>-qualify it:</p>

<pre><code>const int LHS = Fact1 + Fact2 + Fact3;
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>If you intend to enlarge the <code>11</code> constant at some point, note that factorials might get quite large. Maybe check (if the limit is known at compile time via a <code>static_assert</code>) that <code>Fact1</code>, <code>Fact2</code> and <code>Fact3</code> as well as the sum of it can't overflow?</p></li>
<li><p>I don't see any use of functions that come from</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;cmath&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>so you might want to remove this line.</p></li>
</ul>

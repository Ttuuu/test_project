<p>I'm not sure that eliminating <code>if</code> statements is a worthwhile exercise.  <code>_steakRules.First(rule =&gt; rule.Predicate(temp))</code> is just a weakly disguised conditional test anyway.</p>

<p>Your state transition rules are too liberal.  According to your implementation, if you cool down a well done steak back to room temperature (<code>steak.AddTemperature(-80)</code>), then it reverts to a raw state!</p>

<p>Also, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steak_tartare" rel="nofollow noreferrer">some raw steaks are edible</a>.</p>

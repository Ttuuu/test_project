<p>This seems horribly overcomplex, and you don't provide a reason why.</p>

<p>A data structure that associates an increasing integer value (starting at 1) with an object of some type would be a <code>list</code> (an <code>array</code> in other languages). Normally they start at zero, but you can fix that pretty quickly by stuffing a dummy value in the <code>l[0]</code> slot.</p>

<p>Making that change would touch just about every part of your <code>ParkingLot</code> class, so I'll ignore the rest of it.</p>

<p>Given how simple the <code>Car</code> class is, I suggest you replace it with a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html?highlight=namedtuple#collections.namedtuple" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>collections.namedtuple</code></a> instead.</p>

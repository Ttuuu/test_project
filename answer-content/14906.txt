<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>This may be overly generic, but could be reused. It "pads" a sequence by making it long enough to fit the requested length, adding as many repetitions as necessary of a given padding item.</p>

<pre><code>def right_pad(length, seq, padding_item=None):
    missing_items = length - len(seq)
    return seq + missing_items * [ padding_item]
</code></pre>

<p>If the sequence is long enough already, nothing will be added.
So the idea is to extend to 2 elements with None, if the second is not present:</p>

<pre><code>track, num_tracks = right_pad(2, track_info.split('/'))
</code></pre>
    </div>

<p>When setting up the SS:SP registers, there is a slight chance that an interrupt might happen between setting SS and SP. The interrupt handler would then write to an unintended memory address. To prevent this, enclose the code between cli and sti.</p>

<p>I'd rather set SP to 07FEh, to align memory reads to 2-byte boundaries.</p>

<p>Instead of <code>jmp $</code> you should not waste energy by replacing it with:</p>

<pre><code>forever:
    hlt
    jmp short forever
</code></pre>

<p>Since you are programming in assembly and not in C, you don't have to use the inefficient C-style strings. You can also use the <code>(start, length)</code> format, which does not need a trailing null character.</p>

<p>I'd allocate the output buffer on the stack instead of using a static buffer, so that you can put something else in that section.</p>

<p>I dimly remember that I initialized CS, DS and ES as well in the boot sector. I don't remember if they have guaranteed values at startup, or maybe that was the common sequence in <code>.com</code> files.</p>

<p>"Found on the internet" is an inappropriate citation. Just mention the URL where you found that information.</p>

<p>Instead of the complicated <code>times</code> expression, can you just say <code>[org 7CFEh]</code>?</p>

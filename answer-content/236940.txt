<p>You probably won't be able to do much to speed up <code>get_hashtag_posts</code> since that's an API call; if you try to hammer it by running multiple queries in parallel, a well-designed API will interpret that as a DDOS attack and rate-limit you.</p>

<p>As far as your code goes, though, you should be using a set instead of a list, since sets are optimized for the exact thing you're doing:</p>

<pre><code>from typing import Set


users: Set[str] = set()
for post in loader.get_hashtag_posts(HASHTAG):
    users.add(post.owner_username)
</code></pre>

<p>This should be a constant-time operation, whereas a list will take longer to search the longer it is (linear-time).</p>

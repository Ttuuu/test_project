<p>I find your test is excelent (and I'll borrow it from you). I would, however, make it a litte bit more exact and not only test the counts of generated locations but also whether they have the expected values.</p>

<p>You are not testing basic functions of collections or ASP.NET-Core aspects because it doesn't matter how it's implemented. What you are testing is whether your application has all the view locations it needs to work correctly.</p>

<p>This is a very important (integration) test and you should not remove it but improve it by asserting the actual locations too. If this breaks then your app wont't work anymore so it's a real lifesaver.</p>

<p>If you're really certain of the necessary conditions for this to actually work, a somewhat cleaner way to do the job would be to use <code>sprintf</code>:</p>

<pre><code>static void sysGui(const char *s)
{
    char buf[1000];
    sprintf(buf, "%s\n", s);
    sys_gui(buf);
}
</code></pre>

<p>You could use a <code>std::ostringstream</code> instead, but <code>sprintf</code> seems more in keeping with the fact that the rest of the code is essentially C anyway (regardless of how it's tagged).</p>

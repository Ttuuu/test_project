<p>Prefixing field members with <code>_</code> is more of an "old school" C# approach. It's a preference, I guess, but I think it's not really used anymore.</p>

<p>If the only thing you do with <code>SECONDS_TO_THROTTLE</code> is <code>Task.Wait(SECONDS_TO_THROTTLE * 1000)</code>, then <code>SECONDS_TO_THROTTLE</code> should be equal to 60000, not 60, it's kind of confusing. At first I thought maybe there was something related to milliseconds, but no.</p>

<p>Reading your explanation, I understand why you do : <code>if (_timesFailed &gt;= ATTEMPTS_BEFORE_THROTTLE * 3)</code>, but if I only had your code, I wouldn't. Consider either adding another constant or maybe a comment.</p>

<p><code>CheckForThrottle</code>'s name is confusing. Reading this, I'd expect the method to tell me if I need to throttle, not to do the throttling itself. I'd either rename it to something else. But then again, I'd notice that a name like <code>MaybeThrottle</code> is a poor name. I'd keep the "should I throttle?" approach in this method, but I'd move <code>Task.Delay(SECONDS_TO_THROTTLE * 1000).ContinueWith((t) =&gt; { _timesSinceReset = 0; });</code> some place else.</p>

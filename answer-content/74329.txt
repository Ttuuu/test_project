<h2>Doc Comments</h2>
<p>Well done! I rarely see <em>a single method</em> so thoroughly documented with XML doc comments. There's a catch though. Be careful about just how much you do this. It can really obstruct the readability of the actual code. I count roughly <em><strong>20 lines</strong></em> of documentations here. Is all of that really necessary? I don't think it is.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>/// &lt;typeparam name="T"&gt;
///     The output type.
/// &lt;/typeparam&gt;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>That's..... useless. It's obvious. Don't document the obvious.</p>
<h2>Style</h2>
<p>I don't know a C# dev on this site that doesn't prefer new line braces to the "Egyptian" style braces that you use. If you're working with others, I would recommend you stick with the "C# style", but really, it doesn't matter. You were 100% consistent and that is what <em>really</em> matters at the end of the day.</p>
<h2>Null Coalescence</h2>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>if ((underlyingNullableType ?? type).IsEnum) {
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm sorry, but wtf? How do you expect anyone to wrap their head around that?</p>
<p>Null Coalescence has a time and place. This  isn't it, and it's all over the place in this code. It's seriously harming readability/understandability.</p>
<p>I'll be clear about it. There's nothing wrong with <code>underlyingNullableType ?? type</code>, but once you put that inside of an <code>if</code> statement <em><strong>and</strong></em> call a method on it... it's.... meaningless. It becomes completely ungrokkable.</p>

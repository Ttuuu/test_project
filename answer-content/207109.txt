<p>I would treat the work to do as [head] followed by [tail].  The head item is not preceded by a separator while all tail items are preceded by a separator.  The code can use this difference.  The pseudocode then looks something like:</p>

<pre><code>// Process head.
processHeadItem()

// Process tail
repeat
  processSeparator()
  processNextTailItem()
until (tail all processed)
</code></pre>

<p>In real code you could start the tail processing loop with <code>for (int i = 1, ...</code> since <code>i = 0</code> is the head item. </p>
    </div>

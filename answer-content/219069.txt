<p>The first problem is that you are trying to find all prime numbers under number. The number of prime numbers under x is approximately x/ln(x) which is around 22153972243.4 for our specific value of x</p>

<p>This is way too big ! So even if you where capable of obtaining each of these prime numbers in constant time it would take too much time.</p>

<p>This tells us this approach is most likely unfixable.</p>

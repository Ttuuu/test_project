<p>I think what I would change it were the picking current year process, so it becomes dynamic and not <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_coding" rel="nofollow noreferrer">hard coded</a></em>, and maybe reduce the info about my age in one line:</p>

<pre><code>from datetime import date
current_year = date.today().year
year_of_birth = int(raw_input('Enter Year Of Birth: '))
age = current_year - year_of_birth
print('You are %s years old.' % age)
if age &lt; 18:
    print('YOU SHALL NOT PASS!')
else:
    print('Welcome To The Portal.')
</code></pre>
    </div>

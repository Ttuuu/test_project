<p>The <code>exp</code> grows inside the loop, and is not bound by a constant; ditto for <code>s</code>. This immediately disqualifies the solution as in-place. Besides, the time complexity (as it matches the growing string in the loop) seems quadratic.</p>

<p>A true in-place algorithm, with linear time complexity, starts with reversing the entire string:</p>

<pre><code>ereh dlrow olleh
</code></pre>

<p>Now the words are in the desired order, but are themselves reversed. The only thing left is to reverse individual words.</p>

<p>Implementing a linear time in-place (sub)string reversal is left as an exercise.</p>

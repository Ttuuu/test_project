<p>I do have a few suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li>First of all, you don't need to reactivate your main
workbook every loop, since you hold it's reference in a variable
anyway.</li>
<li>Second, instead of creating new workbook and copying the sheet over, just make a copy to new workbook (i.e. wks.Copy creates copy in new workbook, you can then assign it to a variable since, as you said yourself, it is now the active workbook)</li>
<li>Lastly, unless you want to remove the references (for example if the links contain sensitive information), then I wouldn't worry about it. Excel stores the last value from links in cache within the file.</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on your setup, suggestion 2 might actually speed it up a little by reducing the number of actions.</p>

<p>To copy sheet to new workbook, simply <code>ws.Copy</code>, then you can <code>set newWs = Activesheet</code> (or using your naming <code>set NewBook = Activeworkbook</code>) to save it's reference, or just skip that also and put <code>Activeworkbook</code> into your <code>With</code>.</p>

<p>This code is pointless since it creates <a href="https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/535635/Async-Await-and-the-Generated-StateMachine" rel="nofollow noreferrer">async state machine</a> while the code you execute is actually synchronous code.
So eventually you get a performance penalty for the creation of a state machine but no reward of asynchronous execution.</p>
<p>Consider using <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> when you're dealing with IO operations. Usually, such methods already provide asynchronous API. You can spot this as such methods return <code>Task</code> or <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code></p>

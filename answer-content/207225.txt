<p>I added the answer with the link recommendation to a jar:</p>

<p><a href="https://afajardomorera.github.io/ExcelReader/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://afajardomorera.github.io/ExcelReader/</a></p>

<p>Last tuesday, I finished the development of the 0.0.1 version of that library.</p>

<p>Is an application where you can read and extract the information of an excel file and set the values to the java objects you define for it.</p>

<p>To do this, you have to create a property file with the configuration needed (explained in the url)... basically, you can set the sheet indexs to process, what binding class for each sheet, if you want.. what binding class for data rows (will be a list field of that type into the sheet binding class), complete cell reference to process specific cells... and the name and type of variable to binding the cell values, that have to be fields with the same name and type into binding classes.</p>

<p>To summarize... you only have to add jar into your app, define de property file and the binding classes (depends on the data you want to process in the excel file) and only have to invoke the ExcelReader.reader method with params: Excel File, Map and ResourceBoundle... </p>

<p>Map: Key is the SimpleName of the class. Value is an instance of the object (new TableDTO(), for example)
ResourceBoundle: is the property file loaded into a ResourceBoundle</p>

<p>The reader method return a Map where Key is the sheet index and value is a List of the Objects you have defined with the information of the excel inside.</p>

<p>Is my first time in this web. If here only post code... I take note about that for next posts.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

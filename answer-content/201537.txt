<p>This question is stale, but...</p>

<p>A. For efficiency, you can just call <code>toLowercase()</code> once. </p>

<p>B. One of the fundamental questions is whether an empty string-- or a string with no letters-- is a palindrome or not. If you say yes, then you don't need to put any code for it and you'll get the right answer:</p>

<ol>
<li>normalize string by removing all non-letters and lower-case.</li>
<li>reverse it</li>
<li>return true or false based on equivalency</li>
</ol>

<p>C. Your point C, "also returns a string if there is no string supplied" isn't really accurate. If you pass it an empty string, you get the error string back. This is probably a bug. But to answer your question, for a boolean function, it's probably much better to just throw an exception. In this case, you can just take all this code out. The reverse code will blow up and you'll get the exception. </p>

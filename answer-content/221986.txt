<p>This looks like a fairly common exercise (in futility?) A common scenario that can't be represented here is be a lifeguard who is promoted to a manager but still does a few shifts saving lives.</p>

<p>The position should be a property of staff. Checking pH should be a task that has a requirement for managerial position from whoever is assigned to it. It has to be performed regularly so there should be a work schedule. Might as well throw the lifeguard shifts in the schedule too with clocking in and out too. It gets complicated very quickly.</p>

<p>What I am trying to say is that attempts to represent organization hierarchies or taxonomies as a class structure always fail quickly when they encounter real life. Usually this is done with vehicles or animals but this works as an example too. The correct way is to represent roles as properties. :)</p>

<p>I sense that you think too much about SOLID, padawon. You need to think about what the game IS, and the things that ARE. Objects do things. What they do defines what they are. Properties capture the state of a thing as it does stuff. Leave the search for the unified field theory of object oriented design for later.</p>

<p>Obsesssing over Open/Close results in one-method classes.</p>

<p>Single Responsibility is THE force w/in the SOLID universe. Your midiclorians are too low, padawon.</p>

<p>What, in all the universe, is not an object? To name a thing "obj" (or xxxObj)  is to deny its purpose, padawon. </p>

<p>Send Obj.cs to CERN, for you have discovered the one, fundamental particle that underlies the fabric of the universe. It is an amorphous abstraction  that informs all entities derived therefrom that <a href="https://youtu.be/yJJA6WRpvlg?t=107" rel="nofollow noreferrer">they have no purpose</a>; that each obj is a distinction without a difference.</p>

<p>The secret is, Mr. Anderson, that there is no spoon - or Apple, or Barrier, or anything; not in this Snake Game corner of the universe. There is not a single coherent class here. </p>

<p>I would suggest, to get performance and still keep the original intact, that .net libraries are probably not the best choice.  </p>

<p>One suggestion that would work, if you can allow smaller chunks(8GB), is <a href="http://7-zip.org/download.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">7-Zip</a>.  It's free, open source and includes a file explorer.  It will split a 32GB file into 5 volumes in about 20 min.  Anyone with the same software installed can combine the volumes back again.  It even includes the option to calculate a checksum for the file to help confirm it's still the same file.</p>

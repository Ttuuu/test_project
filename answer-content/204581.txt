<p>Adapting from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/43112103/7486879">here</a> would be a cleaner way to do what you want.</p>

<pre><code>params = df.iloc[(df['soc [%]']-z).abs().argsort()[:1]]
</code></pre>

<p>There might be faster ways if your <code>soc [%]</code> column is fixed with those values. </p>

<p>Also, you should consider not measuring the time for <code>pd.read_csv</code> as that isn't what you are wanting to know the execution for.</p>

<p>Please be consistent. It is <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/codeconventions-141270.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">customary</a> to put a space on each side of an <code>=</code> assignment and a space after each comma.</p>

<pre><code>public DBObject() {
}
</code></pre>

<p>I think you meant to declare that <code>private</code>, to make the default constructor inaccessible. But it hardly matters, I would just delete it. Oh, wait, you don't use either constructor, nor the three attributes. Delete everything up to this point.</p>

<p>Your comment was very explicit about "don't forget to close all of...", and then you closed nothing. The try / catch should be in <code>main</code> instead, and it should be try / catch / finally, or better use try-with-resources.</p>

<p>Do not assign NULL when declaring variables, as that is default.</p>

<pre><code>        } catch ( Exception e ) {
</code></pre>

<p>Do not be lazy - list the particular exceptions. Consider listing them in the function's signature in a <code>throws</code> clause, or alternatively replace the print &amp; exit with a rethrow: <code>throw new RuntimeException(e);</code></p>

<pre><code>    String q="select *from compte";
</code></pre>

<p>It is usual to put a blank after the star. Just as this combines declaration with assignment, you might have chosen to declare and assign <code>dbo</code> in a single line.</p>

<p>Spell out each column name, rather than relying on <code>*</code> which supplies an arbitrary order. Databases and programs drift in different directions more often than you might think. Bit rot happens.</p>

<p>There's nothing wrong with declaring half a dozen column variables. But here, you might have simply asked <code>println</code> to call <code>getString</code> directly.</p>

<p>There's nothing wrong with string catenation, but here <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#format-java.util.Locale-java.lang.String-java.lang.Object...-" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>.format()</code></a> would have been a good fit.</p>

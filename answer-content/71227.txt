<p>In addition to the point made by RubberDuck there's some stuff you should definitely change in addition to that:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>    int number = new Scanner(System.in).nextInt(), value;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Don't do this. Every variable declaration has the right to stand on its own. Glossing over this, one could miss the declaration of <code>value</code>. Additionally if your input is not an int you'll get an <code>InputMismatchException</code> if the user didn't enter an integer.</p>

<p>There is also a much easier way to get every digit of a number, instead of the bunch of unintuitive String transformations you are doing.</p>

<pre><code>int lowestSignificantDigit = number % 10;
number = number / 10;
</code></pre>

<p>You just repeat the code above until there is no number left ;)</p>

<hr>

<p>Additionally I think that the ternary inside your <code>System.out.println</code>  is rather unclear. As soon as you extract the determination of Happy / Not Happy you should simply use the return value of the method you extracted.</p>

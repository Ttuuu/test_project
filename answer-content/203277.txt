<p>You inner loop contains:</p>

<pre><code>int differnce = Math.abs(Arrays.stream(array, 0, i).sum() - Arrays.stream(array, i, array.length).sum());
</code></pre>

<p>That does (i-0) operations for first sum and (array.length-i) for second, for a total of array.length-i+i-0=array.length. As the size of input is <code>n=array.length</code> that really gives O(n*n). Replacing for-loops with Streams doesn't improve complexity, only hides it a bit.</p>

<p>Your class requires T to be DefaultConstructible for an empty container. <code>std::vector</code> doesn't.</p>

<p><code>__VECTOR2_HPP</code> - change to <code>VECTOR2_HPP__</code></p>

<p>Don't publicly inherit from such complex classes as <code>std::vector</code>. For example, think of the results of calling <code>front()</code> on an object of your class.</p>

<p>There is no reason for a hardcoded constant like <code>Concept::RESA</code>. Make it a parameter. Better yet, make the actual extent exponentially growing.</p>

<p>There is no need for <code>rresa_</code>. The <code>std::vector</code> itself handles it better.</p>

<p>Where do you use <code>Vector::Error</code>?</p>

<p>No modifications of your container other than by just looping through <code>push_back()</code> and/or <code>push_front()</code> are thought out at all. The ones inherited from <code>std::vector</code> are broken, and even the ones written by yourself are going to lead to unexpected results with <code>T</code> being something like <code>std::shared_ptr</code>.</p>

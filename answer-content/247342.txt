<p>Note: those are my personal opinions, whenever I write that you should do something, treat it as 'I think you should'. Although I usually don't do that, I will not give you solutions to the 'issues' that I am going to point out, it seems like you are good at figuring things by yourself. However, if you don't know how to - ask away.</p>
<p><strong>Positives</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>I really like the idea of the variables like <code>answer_A</code>.</li>
<li>Functions are named as I would expect them, when I read the name - I know what is happening.</li>
<li>Same goes for variable names, most of the variables are properly named</li>
<li>Your code is very readable, I didn't even have to have any explanation to understand what it is doing - keep it up!</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Extract more functions</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>The following can be generalised to a separate function and hence you can have the same logic for other main functions.</p>
<pre><code>if choice in answer_A:
        print("The garlic did stopped the vampire but it did not stopped it's blood thirsty bats.\n\n RIP")
        return "Gameover"
    elif choice in answer_B:
        print("This is not hide n'seek \n\n RIP" )
        return "Gameover"
    elif choice in answer_C:
        return "village"
    else:
        print('Invalid input')
        time.sleep(1)
        option_castle()
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Printing options can be generalized as well - not only to make the code easier but so you can easily expand your number of options - read about <a href="https://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/args_and_kwargs.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">args</a>.</p>
<pre><code>print('''    A. Take the garllic to scare the vampire.
    B. Hide
    C. Escape from backdoor.''')
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Variables</strong><br>
<code>"Gameover"</code>,<code>"intro"</code>, <code>"cave"</code> etc should be extracted to variables so you can easily translate/refactor it later.</p>
<p><strong>Generalizations</strong></p>
<p>You might want to extract reading user input and writing the output to a separate class/function (class is preferable). This will give you opportunity to port your game to UI other than console.</p>
<p><strong>nits</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Usually, it is a good practice to use <code> if __name__ == "__main__"</code> (see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/419163/what-does-if-name-main-do">here</a>) when you want to run script directly (<code>play()</code>)</li>
<li>Variables <code>y</code> and <code>x</code> could be better named to indicate what they contain</li>
<li>Extract <code>1</code> in <code>time.sleep(1)</code> to a variable. You might want to change it later and if you would have more functions, it would be annoying.</li>
</ol>

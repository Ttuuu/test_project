<p>WRT your JavaScript code, I don't like the <code>firstnum</code>, <code>secondnum</code>, and <code>first</code> variables. I believe they cripple your code into a series of corner cases that make it difficult to read, and possibly further modify.</p>

<p>You already allow the user to sum more than two numbers consecutively. I would then suggest using an array to store the numbers, and reducing the array to a single number when the result of the sum of those numbers is actually requested. You could also store the final sum in a new array (replacing the old one) so that it is the first number to use for the next operation.</p>

<p>WRT jQuery, I would at least try to extract frequently accessed "elements" (e.g. <code>$('.screen')</code>) into their own global variable (e.g. <code>$screen</code>, with the <code>$</code> prefix, so as to make it clear that it contains a jQuery collection).</p>

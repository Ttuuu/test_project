<p>In addition to the other answers, you can also take advantage of python dictionaries:</p>

<pre><code>a = b = c = d = e = 0
...
else:
    t = random.randrange(1, 7)
    if t == 1:
        a += 1
        print("You caught a cod!")
    elif t == 2:
        b += 1
        print("You caught a salmon!")
    elif t == 3:
        c += 1
        print("You caught a shark!")
    elif t == 4:
        d += 1
        print("You caught a wildfish!")
    elif t &gt;= 5:
        e += 1
        print("You caught nothing!")
</code></pre>

<p>Becomes:</p>

<pre><code>caught_fish = {
    'cod': 0,
    'salmon': 0,
    'shark': 0,
    'wildfish': 0,
    'nothing': 0,
}
...
else:
    t = random.randrange(1,7)
    # clamp 't' to dictionary size
    if t &gt; len(caught_fish):
        t = len(caught_fish)
    # pick a type of fish from the list of keys of 'caught_fish' using index 't'
    type_of_fish = list(caught_fish)[t - 1]
    # update the dictionary
    caught_fish[type_of_fish] += 1
    # print what type of fish was caught, or if no fish was caught
    article = 'a ' if type_of_fish != 'nothing' else ''
    print("You caught {}{}!".format(article, type_of_fish))
</code></pre>

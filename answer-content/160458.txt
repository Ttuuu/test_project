<p>In the code below you must realise that <code>score</code> is a variable that is shared between the threads. Which means that it requires synchronization, as you have omitted this synchornisation you will have undefined behaviour (incorrect result most likely).</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 1; i &lt;= MAXPLAYER; i++)
    score += player(playersDarts);
</code></pre>

<p>OpenMP is not a magic box that will automatically make everything faster. You still need to think about synchronisation and proper algorithms. Also starting a thread does have some overhead and if the work done by the thread is small in comparison to the overhead, then you're slowing the program down.</p>

<p>There are plenty of resources on parallel programming on the internet, I recommend starting with doing your threading manually until you know how it works and then start using tools like OpenMP.</p>

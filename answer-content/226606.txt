<p>You’ve made a fairly classic mistake when it comes to modeling cards in software. Cards have different values depending on the game. In some games, an Ace == 1, others 11, sometimes it could be either <em>in the same game</em> (Blackjack for example). Non-face cards aren’t always their value either. In some games, they’re all “5 points”, regardless of the number on the card. </p>

<p>In short, the value of a particular card depends on the game, not the card. How might you redesign to account for that?</p>

<p>I think you can simplify your code quite a bit if you drop the implicit restrictions you have on <code>parent</code>.</p>

<p>Consider the following:</p>

<pre><code>parents(X,Y,Z) :- (father(X,Z), mother(Y,Z)); (father(Y,Z), mother(X,Z)).

father(X,Y) :- parent(X,Y), man(X).
mother(X,Y) :- parent(X,Y), woman(X).
</code></pre>

<p>This gets rid of the implicit genders in your definitions (see your parents declarations). It means you'll need a few more lines, but it allows you to define parentship as data. </p>

<p>It also makes the definition for <code>siblings</code> a tad easier:</p>

<pre><code>siblings(A,B) :- father(F,A), father(F,B), mother(M,A), mother(M,B) A\=B.
</code></pre>

<p>this <s>can</s> will make half-siblings (and step-parentship) a lot cleaner, especially considering Zeus' significant number of illegitimate offspring in case you want to extend the family tree... Greek Gods have quite the messy family if you look closer.</p>

<p>It also makes uncle and aunt slightly easier to follow:</p>

<pre><code>uncle(U,N) :- man(U), ((siblings(U,M), mother(M,N)) ; (siblings(U,F), father(F,N))).
</code></pre>

<p>it can be even easier if you go for a definition with <code>parent</code>:</p>

<pre><code>uncle(U,N) :- man(U), siblings(U,P), parent(P,N).
</code></pre>

<p>making the rest of the family relationships cleaner and easier to follow from here should be rather obvious. It especially eases up the grandparent definitions...</p>

<p>On that note: <code>grandparent</code> has a "small" bug. Since you implicity gendered <code>parents</code>, your <code>grandparent</code> relationship only includes the father's father and the mother's mother. A similar bug has shown itself in <code>son</code> and <code>daughter</code>... The gender of the parent doesn't influence whether the child is a son or a daughter ... <code>father</code> and <code>mother</code> respectively should be replaced by <code>parent</code> in that definition.</p>

<p>As a closing note: You should strive to build your data in a "simplistic" way of atomic units with as little "implicit relation" as possible. This might seem more effort, it will drastically reduce the chance of such bugs to happen though. </p>

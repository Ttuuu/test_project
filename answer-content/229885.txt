<p>You got the SQL part quite well. If you only had been as careful when generating the HTML.</p>

<p>At the very least, you should wrap every bit of output through <code>htmlspecialchars</code>. I'm sure there are better ways, but that's the basic building block, and you should learn it.</p>

<pre class="lang-php prettyprint-override"><code>function html_println($label, $value) {
    echo htmlspecialchars($label) . ": " . htmlspecialchars($value) . "&lt;br&gt;\n";
}

html_println("name", $name);
html_println("class", $class);
// and so on
</code></pre>
    </div>

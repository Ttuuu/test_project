<p>This was difficult to review because so many pieces were missing and had to be inferred.  For that reason, you may find some of these comments off the mark because they are necessarily based on incomplete information.  With that said, here are some thoughts that may help you improve your program.</p>

<h2>Be clear about what's allowed</h2>

<p>While your description said that no C++11 features are allowed, the use of <code>long long</code> types is a C++11 feature.  While that may be supported by your compiler, it's probably worth explicitly noting the exceptions.</p>

<h2>Don't write empty destructors</h2>

<p>Even before C++11, the compiler would automatically generate empty destructors if needed, so there is no need to explicitly write <code>~CCeMiniFileSystem()</code> unless that's also a rule in MISRA (the last time I looked at MISRA rules was when it only covered C).</p>

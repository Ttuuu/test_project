<p>I don't like the 3 argument return you're doing. You're using <code>status</code> and <code>msg</code> to actually do the same thing. They both return a signal of success unless the dollar is truncated. You don't need both pieces of information. Personally, I'd just say that you only need to print a note about the dollar being truncated so that the function only returns the cents value.</p>

<p>Now, you're also overlooking a very simple formula to convert this:</p>

<pre><code>cents = dollars * 100
</code></pre>

<p>You don't need anything more complicated than that for the basic function:</p>

<pre><code>def safe_dollar_to_cent(dollar):
    cents = dollar * 100
    return cents
</code></pre>

<p>If you're not <em>sure</em> that dollar will be a number, you can try converting it:</p>

<pre><code>def safe_dollar_to_cent(dollar):
    cents = float(dollar) * 100
    return cents
</code></pre>

<p>As for truncating, I think it's better as an option. Let the user choose whether or not something will be truncated:</p>

<pre><code>def safe_dollar_to_cent(dollar, truncate=True):
    cents = float(dollar) * 100
    if truncate:
        return int(cents)
    else:
        return cents
</code></pre>

<p><code>int</code> will turn <code>cents</code> into a whole number instead of a decimal, so it's effectively truncating everything after the <code>.</code>.</p>

<p>A few tips that might help you:</p>

<ul>
<li>Good job declaring your global variables at the top of the file. Convention is to capitalize them.</li>
<li>Posting some example data here (even just a row or two) would help greatly.</li>
<li>To get the unique lists of ids and days, I don't believe you need both the <code>.unique()</code> method and the <code>set()</code> functions. I believe just the <code>.unique()</code> method is sufficient and the more performant option.</li>
<li>I would be surprised if you needed to call <code>pd.read_csv</code> in chunks for a 1.2 GB file. Further, I suspect this is really slowing you down. </li>
<li>Many of your <code>for</code>-loops and deeply nested <code>if</code> statements you might consider refactoring into functions to improve readability and re-usability. </li>
<li>The code is sparse on useful comments. </li>
</ul>

<p>Apologies for the brevity of this response. Hopefully this is helpful.</p>

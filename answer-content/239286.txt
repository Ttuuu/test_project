<p>When the original multiples-of-3 code finds a prime, it starts setting bits with the square of that value (<code>for (int j = i * i</code>).  Your multiples-of-30 code does not do this, and can waste a lot of time marking numbers "not prime" that have already been so marked.  As the new prime gets larger, this will consume a growing amount of time.</p>

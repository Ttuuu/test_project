<p>Other suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li>You should check the HostListener attribute from angular side</li>
<li>Also I would recommend to check Renderer, I think it's not the best way how you try to access to element properties</li>
<li>Why are you using <code>e: any</code>? this can be <code>Event</code></li>
</ul>

<p>I'm also not even sure how this code works, <code>this.modelId</code> is not defined.
Finally you should implement some methods, and for sure define the return value. 
E.g.:</p>

<pre><code>close(id: string): Observable&lt;IModalElementStatus&gt; {
    this._isOpen.next({isOpen: false, id: id});
    return Observable.of.....
}
</code></pre>

<p>I know currently it's not returning anything!</p>

<li><p>Of course. You can also do another thing: keep all the user agents in a separate file (eg. <code>ua.txt</code>) and then combine rest of the code with main file. With a one-liner, you can fetch all user-agents in the <code>user_agents_list</code>.</p>

<pre><code>for line in open('ua.txt').read().splitlines():
    user_agents_list.append(line.strip())
</code></pre>

<p>But if you like it that way, just keep it. Remember code is all about the person who writes it, not one who reads it.</p></li>
<li><p>You should not use different functions for different things unless you need to call/use them more than once.</p></li>
<li>Of course. But you should give some comments to let the code reviewer know what you're up to in that part of the code. :)</li>
<li>Instead of changing over to <code>asyncio</code>, you should know <a href="https://hackernoon.com/threaded-asynchronous-magic-and-how-to-wield-it-bba9ed602c32" rel="nofollow noreferrer">How to Wield Threaded Asynchronous Magic</a>.</li>
<li>Yes but you should add <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">DocStrings</a>. To test your code for the PEP standard use a linter such as <a href="https://medium.com/python-pandemonium/what-is-flake8-and-why-we-should-use-it-b89bd78073f2" rel="nofollow noreferrer">flake8</a>.</li>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

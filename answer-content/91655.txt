<p>The program works great on my TI-84+. This answer will focus on the main loop:</p>

<pre><code>{1,1→L₁
Repeat getKey
Ans→L₂
Pxl-Change(L₁(1),L₁(2
Ans+L₁→L₁
L₂*(1-2not(Ans and Ans≠{62,94
End
</code></pre>

<li>I spent way too long trying to decrease the size. First I thought you could eliminate the <code>*</code>, then I figured you could move <code>→L₂</code> to the long line and eliminate the third line. Then I thought you could even eliminate <code>L₂</code> completely. But they all don't work :(</li>
<li>You can increase the speed through size:speed proportion of this program by using a solution like Thomas's, with real( and imag(.</li>
<li>Using one complex list is going to be faster than using two simple ones.</li>
<li>You can't ;) this code is too good.</li>

<p>This general topic is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring" rel="nofollow noreferrer">refactoring</a>. I could link you to one of my many favorite books and websites on the topic but I'll leave some general pieces of advice.</p>

<p>A good start is to break your program into smaller chunks of functionality. Make sure they're well named and easy to understand, in other words imagine you were someone who's never seen this code and had to fix an issue with it.</p>

<p>If a file is growing too large, you may want to break it into several files each with their own sub-functionality.</p>

<p>There are many great sites and talks on the topic both within the Python programming language and beyond. I encourage you to look into them after breaking down the first pieces of advice and sharing this code with a peer and receiving feedback from them. See what you understand, and ask for clarification about the parts you don't. Keep an open mind and know that much of this is subjective.</p>

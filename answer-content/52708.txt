<p>In practice, there is normally no difference between <code>span</code> and <code>font</code> if you do not use any of the specific attributes of <code>font</code> but only a <code>style</code> attribute. In principle, the difference is that <code>span</code> has no meaning whatsoever beyond turning a piece of text to an inline element, whereas <code>font</code> additionally means that some font styling is applied to the text. However, when none of the attributes <code>size</code>, <code>face</code>, and <code>color</code> is used, <code>font</code> does not say anything about font styling.</p>

<p>There is nothing you can win by using <code>font</code> in the case described. There is hardly anything to lose either, though various <em>theoretical</em> possibilities can be presented.</p>

<p>It would be a different matter if you used the attributes of <code>font</code> in addition to or instead of CSS styling and/or other presentational markup. If you generated <code>&lt;font color=red&gt;&lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</code>, then the text would be in bold and in red even when CSS has been disabled. This is relatively theoretical, though, and the downside is that many people would blame you for not using “proper markup” by their standards.</p>

<p>I do feel that negative numbers seems a bit backwards compared to most other libraries I have used. I am not sure what all would be involved with reworking this code to utilize positive numbers but it seems it may be hefty. Though maybe you could accept positive numbers and convert them to negatives by subtracting them from the length of the string. </p>

<p>I see one spot that may have a possible performance improvement- in the recursive call to <code>setSelection()</code>: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>setSelection(
    lastFocus - lastNode.textContent.length,
    Array.from(lastNode.childNodes),
    method
);
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>here <code>Array.from()</code> is called to copy the array of nodes from the <code>childNodes</code> collection  from <code>lastNode</code>. The spread operator can also be used to put those child nodes into an array (from the node collection), allowing you to eliminate that extra function call.</p>

<pre><code>setSelection(
    lastFocus - lastNode.textContent.length,
    [...lastNode.childNodes],
    method
);
</code></pre>

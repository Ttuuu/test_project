<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>You can address both of the your problems using "struct".</p>
<p>By making something like this:</p>
<pre><code>struct myBorad 
{
    char board[3][3] = { {'1', '2', '3'}, {'4', '5', '6'}, {'7', '8', '9'} };
    bool bMyBoardStatus[9] = { false };
};
myBorad g_myBoard;
</code></pre>
<p>You then need to change each of the fields as "taken" by setting them to "true".
after each player play.</p>
<pre><code>g_myBoard.bMyBoardStatus[0] = true;
</code></pre>
<p>Now that you have this in place you can add two ifs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check if the status of selected by player place is "taken" aka not false.</li>
<li>Check if all the array aka all nine of them are true and you didn't meet the win condition yet that means its draw.</li>
</ol>
<p>there are more elegant solutions but this will help you get what you need, and this does not have to be in struct. i prefer this way.</p>

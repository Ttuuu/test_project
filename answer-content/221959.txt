<p>Some suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do not use <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1145781/96588">mutable default arguments</a>, they will mess with your subsequent calls. There are some very rare cases where mutable default arguments make sense, but this does not look like one of those.</li>
<li>Split generation of data from saving that data to a file. That way either method can be reused. If you also pull out the file handle to a <code>main</code> method you can dependency inject the file handle and test the whole functionality.</li>
<li><code>details</code> have the same pattern everywhere, so they should also be a class or should be part of <code>Exercise</code>.</li>
<li>Like most Python code this could benefit from type annotations using MyPy.</li>
</ul>

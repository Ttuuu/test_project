<p>This is a very good question. Thanks for asking.</p>

<p><strong>Review</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'm ignoring <code>is True</code> as others have mentioned it.</li>
<li>Second code piece is reasonably better than first one, since you have further reduced duplicated information.</li>
<li>I prefer second one over others personally and it's readable for me.</li>
<li>Third one is too verbose. But it is readable nevertheless.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Boundaries should be clean</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>If you are using set of similar function to interact with <code>user_agent</code> it would be better to create a wrapper class such as <code>UserAgent</code> in your code.

<ul>
<li>It is a good practice to wrap third-party behaviour. </li>
<li>This gives you more control and it becomes easier for you to maintain your code even when you update third-party libraries.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Code at the boundaries needs clear separation and tests that define
  expectations. We should avoid letting too much of our code know about
  the third-party particulars. It’s better to depend on something you
  control than on something you don’t control, lest it end up
  controlling you.</p>

<p><strong>Is explicit better than implicit?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>This should be carefully interpreted. It depend on the context. In your scenario even though third piece of code is more explicit it is poorer than other code because it has duplicate information therefore violating <strong>Don't Repeat Yourself</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Duplication (inadvertent or purposeful duplication) can lead to
  maintenance nightmares, poor factoring, and logical contradictions.</p>

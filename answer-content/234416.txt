<p>This script mixes jQuery DOM lookups (e.g. <code>$(".respond")</code>) with native DOM lookups (e.g. <code>document.getElementById('videoElement')</code>). It is best to use only one style to avoid confusion (e.g. for anyone reading your code, including your future self). If you are going to load jQuery on the page then you might as well use it. Otherwise if you don't need it then it could reduce the page load time slightly if it is removed. You might find <a href="https://ilikekillnerds.com/2015/02/stop-writing-slow-javascript/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this article</a> interesting. </p>

<p>Indentation is inconsistent, though maybe that was a mistake during insertion of the code into your post.</p>

<p>The first line in <code>playVid()</code> references <code>videoElement</code> which looks up the element by <code>id</code> attribute implicitly. </p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>function playVid() { 
    videoElement.play();
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This can also confuse readers of your code. Because <code>myVid</code> points to that same element, that variable could be used instead.</p>

<pre><code>function playVid() { 
    myVid.play();
</code></pre>

<h2>Constant members</h2>
<p><code>n</code> and <code>k</code> can be constant, so long as</p>
<ul>
<li>you remove them from being parameters to <code>crackSafe</code></li>
<li>you add them as parameters to a constructor</li>
<li>the constructor uses inline initialization syntax, i.e. <code>n(n)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, your two member functions should - in their current form - be bare functions outside of a class, since the class member variables only really have transient meaning. For this to make sense as a class, <code>n</code> and <code>k</code> would only make sense as "permanent" attributes per instance.</p>

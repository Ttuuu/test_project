<p>Roland Illig provided an excellent review; there are a couple of points I'd like to add:</p>

<p>The standard header file <code>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> defines the macro/constant <code>BUFSIZ</code>. This macro was developed primarily for input and output buffers. In the original C it was defined as 1024, but now it varies from system to system, probably based on the file system blocking size.</p>

<p>It might have been better to define to define the character array using <code>BUFSIZ</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>assert()</code> macro is generally useful as a debugging tool and not included in production code. It will be <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cassert/assert/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">optimized out of the code if the macro <code>NDEBUG</code> is defined</a>.</p>

<p>The first time I read through the code, I missed all of the <code>break;</code> statements; it might be better if each statement is on a separate line.</p>

<p>Based on the answer supplied by 200_success, here is an alternate version which goes slightly faster again (in Chrome at least).</p>

<p>It finds the max, and then the max of the remaining two. This means the square is only calculated for the two relevant maximums. This is not as large a difference as the original to the answer of 200_success, but still worth noting.</p>

<pre><code>var sumSquareTwoMax = function(x, y, z) {
      var a = Math.max(x, y);
      var b = Math.max(Math.min(x, y), z);
      return a * a + b * b;
 };
</code></pre>

<p>People have talked about simplifying the return temporary, but not the interior temporaries: </p>

<pre><code>ComplexNumber operator+(ComplexNumber a, ComplexNumber b) {
    //Just add real- and imaginary-parts
    return ComplexNumber(a.real + b.real,
                         a.imaginary + b.imaginary);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Conversely, sometimes you should make a temporary.  Notably, the denominator in the a/b calculation should be a temporary.
Mind you, this is the absolute value of b, so maybe that line reads (given the relevant function is defined):  </p>

<pre><code>double abs_b = abs(b);
</code></pre>

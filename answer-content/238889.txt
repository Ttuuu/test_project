<p>Not that it is important, but <code>pop</code> and <code>push</code> both use unbounded loops to wait for other operations to finish. So strictly speaking your queue implementation is not lock-free. This <em>can</em> be a performance problem in case of oversubscription (i.e., when you use more threads than you have cores).</p>

<p>However, with regards to performance improvements you should first run some profiling tests. If you come back with some results where most of the time is spent, we might be able to give a few pointers.</p>

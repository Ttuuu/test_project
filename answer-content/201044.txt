<p>Note: Bear in mind that you are relying on the OS's ability to correctly calculate packet loss. (Please see: <a href="https://networkengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/30940/difference-between-ping-timed-out-and-destination-host-unreachable">https://networkengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/30940/difference-between-ping-timed-out-and-destination-host-unreachable</a>)</p>

<p>You may wish to check for such phrases as 'Destination host unreachable' in your output as Windows does not count those responses as lost packets.</p>

<p>To bullet-proof your code, you might want to call the subprocess.check_output method from within a try...except. Losing your network connection during the call can result in an unexpected error which will prevent your scanning function from reaching its last line and looping.</p>

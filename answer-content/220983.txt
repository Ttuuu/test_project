<p>Some advise using <code>for (;;)</code> instead, but this loop really isn't necessary. But you don't even have a loop here; you'll exit the loop immediately no matter what is entered. Also this throws an exception if you enter a non-int.</p>

<p>Clearing the terminal should be done in a separate routine in case you want to switch to a terminal library like curses. (Also terminal is not guaranteed to be 24x80)</p>

<p>Try not to loop over the whole grid. See if you can avoid clearing and redrawing everything. Just make the necessary changes. When drawing the walls, think of a different encoding so you don't have to loop over the whole grid.</p>

<p>"divisor" is a bad name for the size of a grid cell.</p>

<p>snake color should be a parameter rather than a literal. Also the snake should draw itself, and <code>drawWindow</code> should call it.</p>

<p>In <code>SnakeContainer</code> types, use a bit more encapsulation, include <code>xpos</code> and <code>ypos</code> together in a <code>struct pos</code> to cut down on duplicated code..</p>

<p>Shouldn't the snake be a member of the board, not a parameter?</p>

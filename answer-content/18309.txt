<ul>
<li><p>Make the ids of the m-n-mapping tables their PK, you probably don't want to have duplicates there.</p></li>
<li><p>Address and Name are to short for real world data.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid duplication of the table name in columns (e.g. jobname) in table jobs</p></li>
<li><p>I'd apply that to ids as well, but your approach is ok, as long as it is used consistent.</p></li>
<li><p>Drop the plural s for tables and constraints, they don't add any value</p></li>
<li><p>Check all names for typos</p></li>
<li><p>StartDate + EndDate + DaysOfWork seem to be redundant</p></li>
<li><p>The structure assumes that all employees work on a project for the complete project. This is completely unrealistic. I'd normally expect a time interval in the employee-job table.</p></li>
<li><p>Why is there a department in a job?</p></li>
</ul>

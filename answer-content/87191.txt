<p>Looking at your production code, my positive test case would check the <code>getToken()</code> and <code>savePayload()</code> methods were invoked; and the same string returned from <code>getToken()</code> was also returned by <code>processTokenRequest()</code>.</p>

<p>Some points:</p>

<ul>
<li>I wouldn't use the any matcher with <code>verify()</code>. Explicitly state what you want. </li>
<li>No need to return value from a method when you don't use the returned value i.e. <code>doAnswer</code> for <code>savePayload()</code> is unnecessary.</li>
<li>As mentioned, <code>times(1)</code> is the default for <code>verify()</code> and used in your first test.</li>
<li>Tests shouldn't throw exceptions.</li>
<li>Static imports often make short code easy to read.</li>
<li>Is <code>isNotBlank()</code> enough?</li>
</ul>

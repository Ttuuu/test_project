<p>Is this what you meant?  Why is it a price?  Price for what?  This would make much more sense if it were a prize.  </p>

<pre><code>        montyHall.chooseDoor();
        montyHall.openDoor();
        if (player.preferresChange()){
            montyHall.changeDoor();
        }
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems incorrect.  Monty doesn't choose the door; the player does.  Monty opens the door.  The player chooses and potentially changes that choice.  And <code>preferresChange</code> is misspelled.  It should be <code>prefersChange</code>.  </p>

<p>In the simulation, <strong>Let's Make a Deal</strong> is the name of the show.  Monty Hall is the host.  So the class that you are calling <code>MontyHall</code> should be named <code>LetsMakeADeal</code> or simply <code>GameShow</code>.  </p>

<p>You are hard coding some things.  For example, your simulation is the classic Marilyn vos Savant one where Monty always opens a door and never opens the door with a car.  That is a strategy.  You should probably code that as a particular implementation.  There are other possible strategies that will produce different results.  For example, what if Monty only ever offers the choice when the player has selected the door with the car behind it?  What if Monty can open the door and display the car?  These strategies will change the results.  </p>

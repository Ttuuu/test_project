<p>This code is a WOM implementation of a stack - Write Only Memory. Normally it's done as a joke. The only way to get the data out of the stack is to parse the standard output waiting for <code>println</code> statements with the values in them.</p>

<p>I can understand that your code is here for you to watch the process happening, but beyond that there's not much real functionality in here. I encourage you to use proper code where the <code>pop()</code> methods actually return their result, and the calling code is the code that prints the output. Alternatively, I strongly recommend you use the IDE's debugger interface to step through your code so you can watch things happen that way.</p>

<p>Having said all that, here are some general comments:</p>

<ol>
<li>your instance variables are not private, and should be.</li>
<li>the <code>size</code> and <code>stack</code> variables should also be final</li>
<li>instead of having a <code>display()</code> method, just override the <code>toString()</code></li>
<li><code>push1</code>, and <code>pop1</code> et all should probably be renamed to <code>pushLeft</code> and <code>pushRight</code>, or really anythong other than 1 and 2. You used the variables <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> so why not <code>pushX</code> and <code>pushY</code>?</li>
</ol>

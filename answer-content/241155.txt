<p>other than above answer my suggestions are</p>

<p>make the code clean by introducing concept into modules had to analysis.</p>

<p>-&gt;prevent buffer overflows in ast .</p>

<p>-&gt;if it is a interpreted language then why should main is used.</p>

<p>--&gt;would you have any semantic checking modules or code optimizing modules ?</p>

<p>--&gt; you can implement symbol tab which can store class objects or custom data types created by the user so that pointer to the functions can be stored on them.so that on
recursive calls you get its advantages.become more faster. </p>

<p>--&gt;you can implement typecasting. and exception handling in this module </p>

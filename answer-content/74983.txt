<p>Your code is hard to read, please use correct indentation and brackets.</p>

<p>For example your <code>for</code> loop:</p>

<pre><code>for(var i = 0; i&lt; word.length; i++)
</code></pre>

<p>confused me at the start! Code shouldn't be confusing! Use brackets ;)</p>

<p>I believe the code will work (hypothetically), perhaps add some comments to make it a bit more clearer.<br>
However your solution has a complexity of \$O(nÂ²)\$, I would suggest to improve it.</p>

<p>A simple possible solution is to sort both strings alphabetically and run over them linear, this way you don't need to check if they are both of equal length, there is no need for 2 nested loops and it will run in linear time (sorting not included).</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>word: 'potato'
jumbled: 'otpato'

sorted word: 'aooptt'
sorted jumbled: 'aooptt'
</code></pre>

<p>run with one <code>for</code> loop over it and check if both match.</p>

<p>Goodluck!</p>

<p>First of all, I find your code very clean and I want to stress my Python proficiency is quite below yours. So I am learning more from you than you will from me. Nonetheless code review exercises are interesting because they force me to do research and learn more in the process.</p>

<p>My background in electronics is rather basic so I have only one remark at the moment. In the <code>Solver</code> class you have defined a <code>print</code> function. Probably I would have simply called the function <code>print_table</code> or similar. You are even using <code>print</code> in a function that is named the same. I find that slightly odd given that <code>print</code> is already a built-in function personally but I may be too conservative. I would be worried about potential downsides or risk of redefining an existing function.</p>

<p>I looked up the list of reserved keywords and built-in names in Python. For reference here is one topic on SO: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/22864250/6843158">Is the list of Python reserved words and builtins available in a library?</a></p>

<p>Demonstration code based on the above mentioned topic:</p>

<pre><code>import builtins

# dump the whole list
dir(builtins)

# returns True
'print' in dir(builtins)
</code></pre>

<p>Not sure if this a real problem.</p>

<p>Regarding <strong>tabular output</strong> I have found the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/tabulate/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tabulate module</a> to be great and quite flexible so I often use it in conjunction with Pandas. I am not sure it supports merged cells which may come in handy, but it should not be difficult to get around this if needed.
Of course I can easily understand that you don't want to import or install another dependency for something you can perform efficiently in 10 lines of code. And here you are gathering the data on the fly, it's not like you have an already populated dataframe just waiting to be printed out.</p>

<p>I might like to enhance this part of the code to customize the output of the results, for example to export the data to <strong>CSV</strong> instead of tabular format. This could be interesting if you want to use this procedure to automatically generate <strong>bills of materials</strong> for ordering electronic components. Since you are mentioning a "simple component selection program" I was thinking that could have been the original intention.</p>

<p>@Dair's answer is good, but there was something else that hasn't been mentioned:</p>

<h1>Don't compare to Boolean values</h1>

<ul>
<li>Instead of <code>if foo == True</code>, write <code>if foo</code></li>
<li>Instead of <code>if foo == False</code>, write <code>if not foo</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Comparing to Boolean values is always unnecessary because the values will already be coerced into Boolean values in the appropriate contexts. While the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Zen of Python</a> does say "Explicit is better than implicit", Boolean comparison looks like nonstandard Python code, and is a bit of a code smell for me.</p>

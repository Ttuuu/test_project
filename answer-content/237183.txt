<p>Few possible improvements :</p>

<p>1.User class is highly loaded with collections and methods, it would be better to follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Separation_of_concerns</a> by having user as plain pojo and other responsibility as service like Friendship service, Conversation service.</p>

<p>2.All conversation type can be handled with generic Conversation class defined by you and we can store type information in another collection in order to avoid limitation at storage level.</p>

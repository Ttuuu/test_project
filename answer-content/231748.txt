<p>Linux has the <code>sendfile</code> system call, which copies data between file descriptors instead of copying the data to userspace and back to kernel space. That may be more efficient.</p>

<p>Your code looks very clean and organized. If you had used named constants instead of magic numbers, you might not even need some of the comments:</p>

<pre class="lang-lisp prettyprint-override"><code>    mov rdx, tax
    mov rsi, but
    mov rdi, STDOUT_FILENO
    mov rax, SYS_write
    syscall
</code></pre>

<p>But I think even with these constants, the comments are still helpful, so I'd probably keep them anyway.</p>

<p>You should add error handling for stdout write errors, such as <code>ENOSPACE</code>.</p>

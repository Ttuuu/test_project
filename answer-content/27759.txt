<p>Go for two methods :</p>

<ul>
<li>the methods will lead to code that is more readable</li>
<li>the signatures make more sense, and you don't need to use parameters as return values</li>
<li>while this is probably slightly slower, we should remember that <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth" rel="noreferrer">"Premature optimization is the root of all evil" (Knuth)</a>; unless you can show that having two loops is a performance bottle neck in your code : don't optimize.</li>
<li>this will be easier to refactor to using the Predicate approach that @fge suggests. Even though at this point that would, in my opinion, be overkill. Nevertheless, a valid option once lambdas are available in 8.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the most part it looks fine. There are a few parts that may be changed. For example, I think that the handle <code>handleDropboxAction</code> method and the usage of the <code>DropboxActionResolver</code> functional interface might be a bit of an overkill. </p>

<p>You could achieve the exact same behavior without creating a custom interface to essentially wrap it an try-catch clause.</p>

<p><code>listFolder</code> arguments could be made primitive (to avoid the null checks).</p>

<p>Your various <code>throws DropboxException</code> declaration could be omitted.</p>

<p>In the worst case (the repeated element occupies the second half of the array), the set will accommodate all N non-repeated elements, therefore the space complexity of the solution is <span class="math-container">\$O(N)\$</span>.</p>

<p>Your intuition is correct; the solution doesn't use the important information. It is used to find out how far apart the repeated elements are. If a distance between them is at least <span class="math-container">\$d\$</span>, the array would be at least <span class="math-container">\$d\cdot(N-1) + 1\$</span> long. Since we know that it is <span class="math-container">\$2N\$</span> long, we can conclude that <span class="math-container">\$d \le \dfrac{2N-1}{N-1}\$</span>, which is effectively 2 for N &gt; 2. It is enough to compare each <code>a[i]</code> with <code>a[i+1]</code> and <code>a[i+2]</code>. The space complexity is now constant.</p>

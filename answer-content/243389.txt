<p>Looking at the jupyter notebook, I wonder if a bit of caching might help?  How many of those datapoints are really unique?  Something as simple as wrapping the often-called functions in a <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDecoratorLibrary#Memoize" rel="nofollow noreferrer">memoization</a> decorator might help.  Any of the calculate_ functions that take just floats are good candidates - I don't think memoizing anything that takes vectors would help.</p>

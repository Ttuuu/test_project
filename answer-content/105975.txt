<p>Unless I am reading incorrectly, you should not require any of the <code>getSorted()</code> methods for the three <code>enum</code> types as they are already... sorted.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>ExSpanishSufix</code> is sorted by <code>exponent</code>, but you have already arranged the values by that in increasing order.</li>
<li><code>SpanishDigits</code> is sorted by <code>number</code>, but you have already arranged the values by that in increasing order.</li>
<li><code>SpanishTens</code> is sorted by <code>number</code>, but you... get the drift.</li>
</ul>

<p>BTW, you can also rely on the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Enum.html#ordinal--" rel="nofollow"><code>ordinal()</code></a> method for <code>SpanishDigits</code> to get the numeric values they represent, instead of having the extra field <code>number</code>.</p>

<p>Inside <code>AbstractLangNumber</code>, you can also consider inlining the results:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public ILangNumber add(ILangNumber number) {
    // just do this
    return createNumber(getNumber() + number.getNumber());
    //long add= getNumber()+ number.getNumber(); 
    //return createNumber(add);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also, your bracing style is quite inconsistent... sometimes you use the Java convention, sometimes you don't, and sometimes you omit them completely. I will suggest sticking to the convention throughout to improve code readability.</p>

<p>The code seems all right; you might add the uniform variable initialization: <code>int n_num {};</code>. Furthermore, the way you read the number of rows is unstable, when you use <code>std::cin</code> to do it. Imagine you enter "b" instead of a number. Your program has no loop, that prevents that. You could use a function that only reads integers:</p>

<pre><code>int readInt(std::istream&amp; stream) {
    /*
     * Function to get integers, that are entered by the user
     */
    int input;
    stream &gt;&gt; input;
    return input;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then <code>int num_n {readInt(std::cin)};</code> would be a possible way to do it.</p>

<p>Second off: why do you have the line <code>else if (i % 2 == 0)</code> ? I suppose you could just use <code>else</code> instead. If <code>i % 2 == 1</code> returns false, it has to be 0. So there is no need to check again. It's like checking if your number is odd, and if it's not checking again if it's even.</p>

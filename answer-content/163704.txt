<p>Since you're not changing any value, I would go with using multiple threads. Depending on how many cores your CPU has, break your array into smaller chunks and let each thread does the search.</p>

<p>For example, split into two. If the upper-hand thread finds the index, return the result, but if the lower-hand thread finds an index, wait for the other thread to finish because it has higher priority and make sure it didn't find anything, then return the result. In case upper-hand thread doesn't find anything, you already have the result for the rest of the array, so it's faster this way.</p>

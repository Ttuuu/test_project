<p>Putting security to the side...</p>

<p>A few points</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When you find what you're looking for in a loop, you can exit / return.  In your case, rather than <code>login = true</code>, you could just <code>return true;</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>You function returns <code>login</code>, however <code>login</code> is only ever <code>true</code> when it is returned. The function should be <code>void</code>, or return something meaningful, such as the logged in user.</p></li>
<li><p>You're searching through the list twice, once to find the matching user/password and then again to find a matching user so that you can tell them their password is wrong.  Really, you only need to search the collection for the user.  If it's not there, the name is wrong.  If it is, then check the password and either they got it wrong, or they're logged in.</p></li>
<li><p>I'm not sure <code>IllegalArgument</code> is the right exception for this situation.  I think of it as something to use if you're passing -1 to a method that expects a positive number.  An argument should either be wrong, or right whereas in your code the same arguments could result in an exception or not, depending on what the user has set their password to.</p></li>
</ul>

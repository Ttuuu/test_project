<p>This uses no variables other than <code>Ans</code>, but because <code>real(</code> and <code>imag(</code> are two-byte tokens, the code is larger. It is also faster than your code according to Timtech.</p>

<pre><code>i+dim(identity(1                    //{1+i,1+i}
Repeat getKey
Pxl-Change(real(Ans(1)),real(Ans(2
Ans+imag(Ans)(1-2inot(real(Ans) and real(Ans)≠{62,94
End
</code></pre>

<p>In your original solution, you can thusly save a total of six bytes at the cost of a small amount of speed, and the use of named lists. Two bytes less than <em>that</em> is a program that starts at (2,2) instead of (1,1) because command order is switched:</p>

<pre><code>dim(identity(1→A                    //{1,1
Repeat getKey
Ans→B
Ans+∟A→A
Pxl-Change(Ans(1),Ans(2
∟Bcos(πʳnot(Ans and Ans≠{62,94
End
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, if your calculator is in radian mode, you can save one more byte by removing the <code>ʳ</code>.</p>

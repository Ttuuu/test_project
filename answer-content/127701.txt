<p>What Raystafarian has answered is all true, however I see the most time wasting unaddressed: </p>

<p><strong>you're doing large number of calculations on the worksheet</strong></p>

<p>To solve it you need to use another array, e.g. <code>NewArray</code>, load the data into it the same way as you did for <code>Arr</code>, perform the calculations there, then you can just load the data back to the sheet: <code>Data.Range(...)=NewArray</code></p>

<p>Also, working always with 1000 rows doesn't seem to be the best idea, instead you can use <code>NumRows=ws.UsedRange.Rows.Count</code></p>

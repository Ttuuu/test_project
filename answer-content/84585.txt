<p>I note that you're restricting your types <code>T</code> to those that are <code>IComparable</code>, that is, those that implement <code>CompareTo</code>. A more general solution would allow the caller to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.icomparer%28v=vs.110%29.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">specify their own <code>IComparer</code></a> which may be that type's <code>CompareTo</code> or may be something else entirely.</p>

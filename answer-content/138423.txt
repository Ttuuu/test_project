<p>Your sorting is overcomplicated as you re-invent a sorting algoritmh in your code while Python has it built-in.</p>

<p>You should use the standard <code>list.sort</code> function and give it an appropriate key (credit to Mathias for suggesting this as it works in-place). "If the name starts with a digit sort by the integer value of the starting number else sort alphabetically".</p>

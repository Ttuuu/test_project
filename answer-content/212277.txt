<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>You've taken an <em>expression statement</em> and unnecessarily made a <code>do/while</code> statement out of it.  You need parentheses around your macro parameters.  You don't need to pass in the pointer you're assigning to as a pointer.</p>

<p>Put all that together and you end up with:</p>

<pre><code>#define ALLOC(p, n)  ((p) = malloc((n) * sizeof *(p)))
</code></pre>

<p>This puts fewer restrictions on how it is used, and allows things like</p>

<pre><code>struct monster *AddMonsters(monster *monsters, int which_monster, int how_many)
{
    int difficulty_add = ExtraMonsters();
    return ALLOC(monsters + which_monster, how_many + difficulty_add);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Yes, you could use <code>monsters[which_monster]</code>, add the extra before using the macro, and put a separate <code>return</code> statement, but all that would be unnecessary restrictions on its use.</p>

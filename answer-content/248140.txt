<p>I think some of your property setters are doing too much.  For example in <code>MainWindow</code>, the <code>Folder</code> property setter doesn't just set the folder name but it also takes time to enumerate and collect all files within that folder.  This goes against the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Single Responsibility Principle</a> and perhaps the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Principle of Least Astonishment</a>.  I have used such applications like that and get frustrated that when all I wanted to do was navigate to a folder but each click seems to force reads from a folder.  In short, setting a folder should only set a folder, and enumerating the files in that folder should be a separate action.</p>
<p>Performance could benefit from implementing some async calls and keep somethings streaming.  You stream with <code>EnumerateFiles</code> but you add them to a list.  This can take a performance hit. I would investigate the exact instant you think you need to read files, and delay reading them right up until that instant.</p>
<p>You should read up on any async methods associated with <code>BitMap</code>.  I find <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46709382/async-load-bitmapimage-in-c-sharp">this post</a> how how to load a bitmap asynchronously with C#.  And you might consider using a background Task to enumerate files or load thumbnails.</p>

<p>There are essentially three parts in this problem:</p>

<ol>
<li>Split stream to tokens.</li>
<li>Confuscate (is that even a word) a token.</li>
<li>Write tokens to a stream.</li>
</ol>

<p>To maintain the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle" rel="nofollow noreferrer">single responsibility principle</a>, these parts should be separated into their own classes. Now all of yourt code is in one class and unit testing it will be fairly difficult.</p>

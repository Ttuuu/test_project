<p>This is a lot of work, and I don't have a lot of time, but I thought I'd throw in my two cents.</p>

<p>So, here's what I've got for you:</p>

<h2>The Good</h2>

<ul>
<li>Your models are nicely formed.  More than a data store, they actually <em>do</em> stuff.  This is good practise.</li>
<li>You've compartmentalised the code into objects that are easy to read and follow.  Good job.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Bad</h2>

<ul>
<li>You're violating <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pep8</a> all over the place.  This is the gold standard for Python development so you <em>really</em> should conform your code to it.  Specifically some of the more glaring violations:

<ul>
<li>Your lines exceed 80 characters <em>a lot</em></li>
<li>It's <code>print(</code>, not <code>print (</code></li>
<li>Operators like <code>=</code> are supposed to be surrounded by spaces unless used in a keyword argument, in which case there shouldn't be any spaces.</li>
<li>Your class names are in ALL_CAPS.  Don't do that.  All caps is meant for constants only.</li>
<li><code>if</code> statements should end with a <code>:</code> with no spaces to the left or right.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Your variable names need some work

<ul>
<li>They violate pep8 since you're using all caps in some in whole or in part.</li>
<li>They're sometimes not using words.  <code>WKN</code> means nothing to someone who didn't write the code.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Your class names are all caps and have underscores.  Again, this is a violation of pep8.</li>
<li>The end of your file has raw logic not wrapped in <code>if __name__ == "__main__":</code>.  This means that if someone were to import your file, your program would actually run.  This is very bad form.</li>
<li>Too much vertical space.  Again, pep8 dictates that there's one blank line before every method, two before a class.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the most part, it's all pep8 stuff, so that's good news.  I didn't actually run the program though, so there may be more that I've missed.  I like to go for style &amp; readability first anyway.</p>

<p>You may also want to consider breaking your code out into separate files for readability and to keep the file you're working on short and simple to follow.</p>

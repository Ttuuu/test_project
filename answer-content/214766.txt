<p>I would raise at least the following points:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Instead of taking as input an <code>std::vector</code>, you could rather take two iterators pointing to the beginning and end of a range. In this way, you can also nicely operate on ranges.</p></li>
<li><p>To avoid <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/14041453/551375">all sorts of evil associated with macros</a>, you can use a lambda function here instead. So just define e.g., <code>const auto sign = [](int v) { return v &gt;= 0; };</code> and use this instead of <code>SIGN</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>You might run into compilation problems with <code>std::max</code> and its arguments being <code>unsigned</code> and <code>size_t</code> (happens on MSVC'15 at least). So you should use the same type for both arguments.</p></li>
</ul>

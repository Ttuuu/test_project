<p>Call your sort method <code>natural_sort</code> -- or even better <code>natsorted</code> to comply with Python's <code>sorted</code>. The reason is that among programmers it is widely known under that name, so I recommend sticking with it. Jeff Atwood writes at <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/sorting-for-humans-natural-sort-order/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the linked article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It isn't called "Alphabetical sort"; it's collectively known as natural sort.</p>

<p>Furthermore, rather use existing software instead of reinventing the wheel if it's not for learning purposes. There's a <a href="https://pypi.org/project/natsort/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>natsort</code></a> Python package available.</p>

<p>You definitely need more quoting of parameter expansions.  Notably, <code>$FTP_PASSWORD</code> may well contain characters that are meaningful to the shell:</p>

<pre><code>FileSizeOnServer=$(curl --max-time 10 -u "$FTP_USER:$FTP_PASSWORD" \
                   --head "$FTP_Path" 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep "Content-Length:")
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure it's a good idea to redirect standard error there - you want errors to be visible, not piped into <code>grep</code>.</p>

<p>I'm not sure there's much value to the size comparison, though - <code>curl</code> should exit with non-zero status if it didn't transfer the whole file, so we should just use it directly:</p>

<pre><code>if ! curl -u "$FTP_USER:$FTP_PASSWORD" "$FTP_Path"
then
    echo "Failed to download" &gt;&amp;2
    exit 1
fi
</code></pre>

<p>Or even simply</p>

<pre><code>set -e
curl -u "$FTP_USER:$FTP_PASSWORD" "$FTP_Path"
</code></pre>

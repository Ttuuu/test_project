<p>There is a much better solution to your problem. Some mistakes you could have avoided - </p>

<p>• You use 2 loops. One would also do it.</p>

<p>• You iterate all the elements in the nested array. You do not need to include the element itself (as indirectly mentioned in the question). Therefore, you can iterate only a[i]/2 elements.</p>

<p>You can optimize this further also. Here is my code but unfortunately it is in Python. Hope you can at least understand that. It is an easy language.</p>

<pre><code>for i in range(int(input())):
    x = int(input())
    sum=0
    for j in range(x/2):
        if(x%j==0):
            sum += j
    print(sum)
</code></pre>
    </div>

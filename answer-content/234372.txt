<p>The biggest issue I see is your functions relying heavily on the structure of the <code>dict</code>s. This may end up not being an issue, for example if these functions are part of a script that you don't expect to change or re-use in future.
My suggestion for how you can improve if you wish to is to use TDD as your functions are a perfect fit for TDD. As you cycle through TDD steps you'll improve your design repeatedly. I think it'll be a worthwhile exercise. In the end you can compare the two solutions and judge how they're different. I suggest you put the code out of sight for a while before doing the final comparison.</p>

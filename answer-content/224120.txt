<p>Lots of good comments already given.</p>

<p>I'll just point out that you should most likely not be writing your own math primitives. It's easy to get wrong, it takes time away from actually creating what you're trying to create, you'll tear your hair out fixing hard to spot bugs and your code (contrary to what most people who write their own math primitives seem to think) will not be faster. Turns out, the people who write math libraries are experienced and have had much longer time than you to debug, design, test and optimize the libraries than you have.</p>

<p>That said, there are two good reasons to write math primitives: you're doing it to learn the maths or libraries or functions you need are not available for your platform, licensing requirements, algorithms you need are missing etc.</p>

<p>There are many good libraries out there, personally I like to use <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page" rel="noreferrer">Eigen</a>. I have no affiliation with the project; I just like their API, they have good performance and don't need to deal with distributing libraries or linking.</p>

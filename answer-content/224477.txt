<p>A short review of things that could trigger me if I were the lead</p>

<ul>
<li>Why are you returning <code>undefined</code>? That is what a function does by default.</li>
<li>All your functions are anonymous, a nightmare in stacktraces</li>
<li>There is a time and place for arrow functions, this code implies that you never use <code>function</code>

<ul>
<li>Though to be fair, the challenge over-uses arrow functions as well</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

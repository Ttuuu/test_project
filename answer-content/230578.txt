<h2><code>static</code> functions</h2>

<p>Both of your <code>getNameNumber</code> and <code>printNumber</code> should be made <code>static</code>, because I doubt that you plan to export them.</p>

<h2>Simpler functions</h2>

<pre><code>printf("Enter the amount of people: ");
</code></pre>

<p>can simply use <code>puts</code>, which doesn't have any formatting code in it. You use <code>puts</code> below, so this would also help with consistency.</p>

<h2>Stack allocation</h2>

<pre><code>person people[size];
</code></pre>

<p>is not available in all versions of C, since <code>size</code> is not a constant. For best portability you'd want to <code>malloc</code> this, or perhaps <code>alloca</code> if you feel strongly that the memory should be in the stack and not on the heap.</p>

<h2><code>const</code></h2>

<p><code>printNumber</code>'s array arguments should be <code>const</code>, since you don't mutate them.</p>

<h2>Your questions</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>To avoid a very long name that exceeds char's size, I limit it to 255. Is there a better way?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For your use case, not really. A fixed array is the most appropriate. <em>However</em>, your code is vulnerable to overflows. You should be putting a width in your <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/scanf/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">format specifier</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To avoid buffer, I included a space before % sign and not use getchar(). Is there a better way?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not sure which usage of <code>%</code> you're referring to, but they all look fairly sane, so no; there's not really a better way.</p>

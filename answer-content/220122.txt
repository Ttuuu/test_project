<p>My impression is that the code seems good: no suggestions at that level,
other than a very minor one. Python's <code>for-else</code> structure is a bit of
an oddball: I never use it and a almost never see it used. More to
the point, it adds no clarity in this specific case. Just return <code>False</code>
outside the loop.</p>

<p>Regarding the algorithm, however, I do have a suggestion. It
seems fairly low level (in the sense of mucking around with character
shifting and copying), not super easy to explain, and it did not
seem intuitive at first glance to me.</p>

<p>A different approach is to rely on string multiplication: if the
full string equals exactly N copies of a substring, then return <code>True</code>.
You just need to loop over all possible substring lengths. For example:</p>

<pre><code>def onlySubstrings(orig):
    orig_len = len(orig)
    max_len = int(orig_len / 2)
    for i in range(1, max_len + 1):
        substr = orig[0:i]
        n_copies = int(orig_len / i)
        if orig == substr * n_copies:
            return True
    return False
</code></pre>

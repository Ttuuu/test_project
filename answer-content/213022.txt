<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: Looks good! This is perfectly reasonable solution for your problem. It's certainly not clumsy.</p>

<p><strong>Optimisations</strong>
The optimisation ShadowRanger points out, is faster, due to compiler optimisations, I wouldn't worry about this at a beginner level (and not even at an experienced level really, unless it was critical to make every optimisation).</p>

<p>The optimisation of checking only <code>isupper</code> or <code>islower</code> that some have pointed out probably isn't valid. If your input is guaranteed to be only alphabetic characters A-Z or a-z, then you can assume that if it's not upper, it's lower. But this doesn't apply generally. '1' is neither lower nor upper for example. Checking only <code>isupper</code> and assuming the opposite on a <code>False</code> result, you would increment your 'lower' counter and that wouldn't be correct.</p>

<p>Your code provides a correct solution and doesn't break when the user inputs an empty string or non alphabetic characters, which is why I'd consider it good.</p>

<p><strong>Possible next step:</strong>
Since you say you're a beginner, I'd look up writing tests if you haven't already and learn a little about how to write good tests. Checking empty input and special characters would be an interesting start. Some terms to search would be edge-case</p>

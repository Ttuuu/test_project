<p>Yes, your approach looks correct to me. I also had faced similar issues earlier in my project (before hooks were introduced) and had used setState for a boolean variable to enable and disable the button.  </p>

<p>The thing which you need to keep in mind is look out for edge cases related to your business requirements. e.g. suppose a async validation is happening but API gave you 401 or some other status code (i.e. validation didn't happen properly but API gave some response), so should you be enabling the button for user to retry or the button should remain disable.</p>

<p>Hoping that I am able to explain you properly. Please revert if something is not clear to you.</p>

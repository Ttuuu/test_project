<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>In this code block here:</p>

<pre><code>...
OutsideWithDoor backYard;
Outside garden;

public ExploreTheHouseForm()
{
    InitializeComponent();
    CreateObjects(); // &lt;--- bleh
    MoveToLocation(livingRoom);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is call to the <code>CreateObject()</code> method, is something I don't like to see in code (it could be a personal style issue) but if you are constructing an object, then all code related to the construction of an object should just stay in the constructor...</p>

<p>I would prefer that it ended up looking like</p>

<pre><code>...
private readonly OutsideWithDoor _backYard;  // now it can be readonly
private readonly Outside _garden;

public ExploreTheHouseForm()
{
    InitializeComponent();

    ...
    _backYard = new OutsideWithDoor("back yard", true, kitchen.DoorDescription);
    _garden = new Outside("garden", false);

    MoveToLocation(livingRoom);
}
</code></pre>
    </div>

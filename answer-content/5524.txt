<p>If you really need this part as fast as possible, one obvious route would be to write it in assembly language. The assembly language you've posted looks a bit on the insane side for this task (at least to me). Given a fixed size, the obvious route would be something like:</p>

<pre><code>; warning: I haven't written a lot of assembly code recently -- I could have 
; some of the syntax a bit wrong.
;
memcpyi80 proc dest:ptr byte src:ptr byte
    mov esi, src
    mov edi, dest
    mov ecx, 20    ; 80/4
    rep movsd
memcpyi80 endp
</code></pre>

<p>That <em>is</em> definitely open to improvement by using (for one example) moves through the SSE registers, but I'll leave that for others to play with. The improvement is pretty small though: recent processors have a special path specifically for memory copies, which this will use, so it's pretty competitive despite its simplicity.</p>

<p>@Mike Dunlavey's comment is good though: most of the time people think they need a faster memory copy, they really need to re-think their code to simply avoid needing it.</p>

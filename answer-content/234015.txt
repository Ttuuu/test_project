<p>Just a side note for you.  It would probably be more efficient to use the <code>Checked_Change</code> handler.  The main caveat is that both the checked and the unchecked will trigger this event.  but since the unchecked is handled first, it's a simple matter of returning if the <code>sender</code> isn't checked. </p>

<p>Since the radiobuttons are actually numbered you don't need the switch block once you have the checked radiobutton identified.</p>

<p>Something like this would work:</p>

<pre><code>private void radioButton_CheckedChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    RadioButton rb = (RadioButton)sender;
    if(!rb.Checked)
    {
        return;
    }
    selectedButton = rb.Name.Last() - '0';
    selectedButtonText = rb.Text;
}
</code></pre>
    </div>

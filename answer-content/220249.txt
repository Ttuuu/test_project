<p>Here's a much faster algorithm:</p>

<p>Create a Person object containing fields like fname, lname, etc and a list of associated Transaction objects. </p>

<p>Then, create a dictionary with "fname,lname" as the key and a list of Person objects as the value. Iterate through your CSV line-by-line, and if that "fname,lname" key isn't in the dictionary, add it along with a Person object that defines the person's details.</p>

<p>However, if the key <em>is</em> in the dictionary then check the other details to make sure it's an actual match. If it is an actual match, add the transaction to that Person's Transaction array. If not, add a new person item to the end of the array. </p>

<h1>General style</h1>

<p>Your general code style is good. The methods are named feasibly and you stick to PEP 8.</p>

<h1>Separate client and server shutdown</h1>

<p>Currently your <code>"quit"</code> command shuts down both the server and client.
Since it is a <em>command</em> entered in the client to the server I'd expect it to either shut down the client (firstly) or shutdown the server, but not both.
You may want to consider using <code>"quit"</code> to shutdown the client only and keep the server running for a later re-connect and use something like "<code>shutdown</code>" to shutdown the server only.</p>

<p>Prior to its shutdown, the server may notify the client about this, by e.g. sending ‚êÑ or another control character.</p>

<h1>Socket limits and data loss</h1>

<p>You statically limited the reading of data from the sockets to 1024 bytes. If you'd send more data, it will get lost.</p>

<h1>Use libraries where applicable</h1>

<p>Have a look at <a href="http://zeromq.org/bindings:python" rel="noreferrer">ZeroMQ</a> or other higher-level libraries if you don't necessarily need to mess with sockets on the low level.</p>

<p>Your code is formatted inconsistently. Sometimes you placed spaces around operators, sometimes not, with no apparent patterns or rules. Just let your IDE format the code automatically.</p>

<p>Sometimes you use snake_case, sometimes camelCase. You should only use one of them, for consistency.</p>

<p>Instead of <code>sum = sum%10</code> you can write <code>sum -= 10</code> since the sum can never be greater than 19.</p>

<p>Having <code>operator*</code> restricted to a single digit is unexpected. That function should better be an internal implementation detail, and <code>multiply</code> should become the new <code>operator*</code>.</p>

<p>Instead of <code>Integer::print</code>, you should define the usual <code>os &lt;&lt; Integer</code> operator. Don't use <code>std::endl</code> unless you really know you need it. A simple <code>'\n'</code> performs better.</p>

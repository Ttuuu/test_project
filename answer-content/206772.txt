<p>To start off, I suggest you split the chunk of if/elif statements into individual functions. By doing this, it'll be easier for someone reader (such as your teacher) to be able to tell what each part of the code is doing. It's also important because it'll help you remember your code when you come back to look at it.</p>

<p>The upper level if statements, which are checking for seats, the code underneath them can be split into individual functions. Doing this would greatly improve your code.</p>

<p>Good luck on your assignment!</p>

<p>One thing that you could update is how you are using the <code>ternary operator</code> for <code>isDark</code>.</p>
<p>Ternary operators are used for returning something based on a boolean response, so either return X if true, or Y if false.</p>
<p>However, every time it is used it is evaluating the statement being passed to it. In this case both times it is evaluating <code>isDark</code>. For the average website, this won't affect your processing time, but it is something to think about.</p>
<p>Instead a classic if/else statement would allow you to run more code off a single evaluation.</p>
<p>You will notice this isn't as <code>sleek looking</code> as ternary and is even more lines of code, but gives more capabilities when you need it.</p>
<pre><code>if (isDark) {
  toggleIcon.children[1].classList.replace('fa-sun', 'fa-moon')
  imageMode(darkLightTheme[0])
} else {
  toggleIcon.children[1].classList.replace('fa-moon', 'fa-sun')
  imageMode(darkLightTheme[1])
}
</code></pre>

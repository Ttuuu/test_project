<p>I don't use C# but took this as a chance to learn some of it... Tested it first on Progress 4GL and then made the C# version (quite ugly one). </p>

<p>My idea was to use modulo to find out if it's needed to increase the difficulty:</p>

<pre><code>score % thresholds[x] &lt; score
</code></pre>

<p>That way there's no need to hardcode the IF-clauses (only need to hardcode the thresholds).</p>

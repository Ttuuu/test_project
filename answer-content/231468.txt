<p>There's a typo in this line:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>}else if(arr[1]+arr[4]+arr[7]==3*10||arr[1]+arr[7]+arr[7]==3*11){  //win condition  outputs the winner player's name for all
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that the second <code>7</code> was intended to be <code>4</code>.</p>

<p>That's the kind of thing that tends to happen when you repeat large blocks of similar code.  And most readers won't spot that.</p>

<p>What you should do is identify the patterns in your groups:</p>

<ul>
<li>Horizontal lines start at 0, 3 or 6, with step size of 1</li>
<li>Vertical lines start at 0, 1 or 2, with step size of 3</li>
<li>Leading diagonal starts at 0, with step size of 4</li>
<li>Trailing diagonal starts at 2, with step size of 2</li>
</ul>

<p>With that observation, it should be easy to replace those lines with simple function calls.  That will make your code easier to write and to review.</p>

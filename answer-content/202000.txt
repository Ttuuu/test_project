<p>If the request <em>is</em> already being served over HTTPS, then it would be a good idea to add a <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security_Cheat_Sheet" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Strict-Transport-Security</code></a> header to the response. <code>Strict-Transport-Security</code> tells the browser that, as a matter of policy, your site wants all requests to your domain to be made over HTTPS.</p>

<p>Be aware that redirecting an HTTP POST request would cause the browser to make an HTTP GET request. To cause the second request to also be made as a POST, you would need to respond with a a <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/99966/51698">307 status code</a>.  Of course, the benefit of a 307 redirect of a POST is questionable, as any sensitive POST data will have already been transmitted unencrypted already.</p>

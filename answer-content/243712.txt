<p>First of all, let me mention that if you want to build a production quality, maintainable, and scalable transpiler you should not do it using regular expressions.  That is regardless of the language in which the regular expressions are written, even if perl.  Without going into much detail, regular expressions work on plain text, and you need more than that to do anything non-trivial.   You can look into compiler theory if you want to learn more about that.</p>
<p>For your use, namely converting something you have full control over into something else you also have full control over in a simple line-by-line conversion, and that <em>only you will use</em> this is fine.  Others have discussed the quality of your current code, I won't go into that.</p>
<p>I will, however, mention that undocumented regular expressions are <em>very</em> hard to maintain.  You should at least document each well - Perl has a verbose form well suited for this.  You should have test cases that ensures that if you put in a known source file, you get exactly what you expect out in the other end.  If not, something broke.</p>
<p>You may also want to consider peer review.  Have a colleague or fellow student to look at your code and listen to what baffles them.  If it confuses them now, it will confuse you too later when you have forgotten the tiny details, which happens to each and every programmer at some point, and THAT is when important projects get rewritten.  At the current state you will probably have a hard time convincing anybody to inherit maintainership of your code.</p>
<p>Good luck - this is a very good exercise.</p>

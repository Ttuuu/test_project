<p>"But let's assume that the entered three numbers have to be summed up and that one has to use xor in some way." Read the instructions again. You're explicitly not allowed to actually sum the numbers. This <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/sum2003/cmsc311/Notes/BitOp/xor.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">can be done using XOR</a> as suggested. Your first part of the solution uses <code>add</code>, disqualifying your code.</p>

<p>The keyword to the actual solution would be checking for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(mathematics)" rel="nofollow noreferrer">parity</a>.</p>

<p>Keep in mind you don't have to add the numbers to know whether the result of a sum would be odd or even:</p>

<ul>
<li>Odd + odd = even</li>
<li>Odd + even = odd</li>
<li>Even + even = even</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether you do this for 2, 3 or 100 numbers is quite irrelevant, just as the actual value of the result.</p>

<p>I don't see anything wrong with the way you are testing.</p>

<p>You may want to include negative numbers in your test cases. </p>

<p>I prefer to have test cases broken up. It's easier to track down failing tests:</p>

<pre><code>@Test
public void testIsSortedSingleNode()
{
    int[] C = { 32 };
    assertEquals(true, SortedOrNot.isSorted(C));
}
</code></pre>

<p>Even in tests you should follow naming standards. Names such as <code>A</code>, <code>B</code> <code>C</code> are not very descriptive. Also they should start with a lower-case letter. <code>result</code> would be a better name. You use the same variable throughout.</p>

<p>Use <code>assertTrue</code> and <code>assertFalse</code> instead of <code>assertEquals(true/false, x)</code>.</p>

<p>IMO <code>arrayLength</code> would be a better name then <code>n</code>. Or you could use <code>arr.length</code>.</p>

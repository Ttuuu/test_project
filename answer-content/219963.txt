<p>Your code looks quite good already. However there are a few details to improve:</p>

<p>1) There is <code>Array.includes</code> which will abstract away the <code>for</code> loop, making the code more concise.</p>

<p>2) You use <code>bmiTotal</code> and <code>BMI</code>, although both mean the same.</p>

<pre><code> const countriesWithLowerBIP = ["Chad", "Sierra Leone", "Mali", "Gambia", "Uganda", "Ghana", "Senegal", "Somalia", "Ivory Coast", "Isreal"];

 const computeBMI = (weight /*in kg*/, height /*in feet*/, country) =&gt; {
   const heightInMeters = height * 0.3048;
   let BMI = weight / (heightInMeters ** 2);

   if (countriesWithLowerBIP.includes(country)) 
     BMI *= 0.82;

   return Math.round(BMI, 2);
 };
</code></pre>

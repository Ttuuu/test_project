<p>I don't think it's a bad practice at all. What you did is called encapsulation. It enables you to exchange the underlying configuration provider (currently the <code>Properties.Settings</code>) to something else without breaking your application because it doesn't rely directly on it. </p>

<p>It's also called the <em>Dependency Inversion Principle</em> the higher module (your application) relies on an abstraction (your <code>Settings</code>) and not on the low level module (<code>Properties.Settings</code>). Usually it's build upon abstract types (or interfaces) but a <em>lite</em> version of this could be your settings layer.</p>

<p>At first I had a little trouble figuring out what VBA environment to load this in (Access, Excel, WSCRIPT, etc.).  I'm making a note here for other users that <code>SpaceInvadersRefactored.xlsm</code> is the Excel file to launch (at the time of this writing).</p>

<p>To start the game, run the <code>RunGame</code> sub in the <code>GameLogic</code> module. It would be helpful to have a button on Sheet1 that will call the RunGame sub.</p>

<p>A user needs to update the hard coded paths. They aren't found in the modules as described in the readme. I suggest doing a Find for <code>"C:\Users\evanm\OneDrive\Desktop\Excel\SpaceInvader</code> and Replace with <code>ActiveWorkbook.Path &amp; "</code> Then it will work for anyone.</p>

<p>A file in this release has a typo. Rename <code>Missle.jpg</code> to <code>Missile.jpg</code></p>

<p>After making those changes I was able to run the game. After my second game ended, Excel crashed. Maybe a class didn't release properly. That's a tough one to find due to the number of classes you're using.</p>

<p>As far as code indentation, I recommend using the free VBA add-in <a href="http://www.oaltd.co.uk/indenter/indentpage.asp" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Smart Indenter</a>.  I'm happy with 98% of how it indents and it's great when you inherit someone else's code.  You can right-click and run it on a procedure, module, or entire project.</p>

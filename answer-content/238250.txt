<p>If this were a real program (i.e. not simply something you are playing and learning with), it would need a lot more error checking.</p>

<p>E.g. If this happens:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would you like to add it?  Press Y or N<br>
  yes<br>
  Alrighty Then</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The program's ambiguous response will mislead the user into thinking that his answer has been accepted, and then the user will get confused about what happens next.</p>

<p>It would be better to have a function that prompts the user and indicates whether a positive or negative response was entered.  E.g.</p>

<pre><code>if positive_response("I don't have that person's name. Would you like to add it?"):
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>positive_response(prompt)</code> can have long lists of possible positive and negative responses and can loop until it gets a definite hit.
The function can be reused later in other parts of the program that need a confirmation.</p>

<p>Similarly nothing checks the entered birthday (e.g. "<em>today</em>" or "<em>last Wednesday</em>").
Again, a self-contained function that loops until it gets a date that it can understand would be appropriate:</p>

<pre><code>birthdays[name] = get_date("Please enter their birthday")
</code></pre>

<p>The function should also convert the date into a standard format.
And again, the function can be reused elsewhere if a date is required from input.</p>

<p>This code is simpler, easier to read, and far less likely to contain bugs:</p>

<pre><code>if positive_response("I don't have that person's name. Would you like to add it?"):
    birthdays[name] = get_date("Please enter their birthday")
    display_birthdays("Updated list of birthdays")
</code></pre>

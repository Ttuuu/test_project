<p>Is your mock ATM class literally named <code>_atm</code>?!  Or is it a non-static class that you have assigned to an instance named <code>_atm</code>?  Either way, I don't like it and find the <code>_atm</code> class to be useless in your limited example.</p>
<p>The <code>BankAccount</code> class, which you do not share, should have a <code>Deposit</code> and <code>Withdraw</code> method, both accepting a <code>BankTransaction</code> as a input argument.  You should include validation of a particular transaction within each method, i.e. do not accept a deposit of negative amount.  You also do not share <code>BankTransaction</code> with us.</p>
<p><code>CheckBalance</code> is not needed, as you would just as easily show the <code>BankAccount.AccountBalance</code> property.  Also the property name could be shortened to <code>Balance</code> since it is the balance of the bank account.</p>

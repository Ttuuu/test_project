<p>I guess you are aware more or less of this (given your PS), but comments have to be there just when they are useful. Some of them that you should remove:</p>

<pre><code># Empty dictionary to store info later on.
# List of seats the user can choose from.
# All prompts.
# Runs until it reaches a break statement.
# Find out how many times to run the while loop.
# Convert the string representation of the number to an integer representation.
# If the user has asked for more seats than the number of seats
        # available execute this block.
# Ask for the users name.
</code></pre>

<p>And you get the idea. Comments don't have to be redundant with the code, and they don't explain always what the code does, but they explain something that is not obvious reading the code. Also, in this case, they make more difficult reading the script, given the extension of them. </p>

<p>Also, do you even need a function at all? It is only used once, so unless you are going to extend the code in the future, you could just place those lines of code where the call of the function is. </p>

<p>Instead of having several prints in a row, you could use triple quote string, as follows:</p>

<pre><code>print(f"""\n--I'm sorry, we only have {len(available_seats)} 
                seats available--
                --Please try again--""")
</code></pre>
    </div>

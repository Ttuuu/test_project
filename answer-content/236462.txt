<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>Probably the biggest issue I see here is naming. In particular, <code>isTrue</code> is very vague - perhaps is <code>isHovered</code> would be better? And conventionally you use <code>set...</code> rather than <code>handle...</code> with <code>useState</code> so this should be <code>setIsHovered</code>. Similarly, I think you should rename <code>setArg</code> to <code>setIconType</code>.</p>

<p>Also, I don't think you can pass 2 seperate functions as a prop. You maybe want to instead do this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div 
  onMouseEnter={() =&gt; {
    setIsHovered(true)
    setIconType('careers')
  }}
&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Other than that, it looks fine to me.</p>
    </div>

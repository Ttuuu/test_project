<p>Why return <code>this</code> at the end of the constructor? I understand the point of doing it in other methods (e.g. to support chaining) but don't believe it is necessary to do so from a constructor.</p>

<p>It is advisable to use <code>const</code> for any value that doesn't need to be re-assigned - this avoid accidental re-assignment later. For example, in <code>getNextChar()</code>, <code>seq</code> and <code>index</code> are never re-assigned so they could be declared with <code>const</code>. And some people may argue that declaring those variables to only be used once or twice right before a <code>return</code> statement uses excess memory, which is perhaps why the suggested code in <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/160776/120114">r10y's answer</a> has them eliminated.</p>

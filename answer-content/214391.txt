<p>The generation of the table was moved to compile time due to very slow startup of the program.  But evidently that problem is no longer present:</p>

<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>$ time ./corrections &gt;/dev/null
real    0m0.001s
user    0m0.001s
sys     0m0.000s
</code></pre>

<p>So the table generator can be inlined into <code>synchronizer.cc</code> just as in the single-file version in the question (using an immediately-invoked lambda to give us a constant).</p>

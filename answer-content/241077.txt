<p>I am bit short on time so I apologize for not doing a more comprehensive review of your code. But I think one area where you can improve is utilization of BeautifulSoup.</p>

<p>The selection method is clusmy, and you are addressing tags that are of no use to you. You can go straight to the DOM elements that matter to you and ignore the rest.</p>

<p>The only trick is finding the right selectors for the page. Here is some code to parse the main table:</p>

<pre><code>stock_table = soup.find("tbody", {"class":"tv-data-table__tbody"})
rows = stock_table.findAll(lambda tag: tag.name=='tr')
for row in rows:
    symbol_tag = row.find("a", {"class": "tv-screener__symbol"})
    if symbol_tag is None:
        symbol = "Not found"
    else:
        symbol = symbol_tag.get_text().strip()

    company_tag = row.find("span", {"class": "tv-screener__description"})
    if company_tag is None:
        company_name = "Not found"
    else:
        company_name = company_tag.get_text().strip()

    print(f"symbol: {symbol}, company name: {company_name}")
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre>
symbol: MSFT, company name: Microsoft Corp.
symbol: AAPL, company name: Apple Inc
symbol: AMZN, company name: AMAZON COM INC
symbol: GOOG, company name: Alphabet Inc (Google) Class C
symbol: GOOGL, company name: Alphabet Inc (Google) Class A
symbol: BABA, company name: Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd.
symbol: FB, company name: FACEBOOK INC
symbol: BRK.A, company name: BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC
...
</pre>

<p>I think you can easily complete the rest. Note that in this code I am skipping the headers because I selected <code>tbody</code> instead of <code>table</code>. Otherwise the first row would return <code>None</code> upon <code>find</code>, but I am handling the case as you can see.</p>

<p>What would be good is handle exceptions, and also if a tag is not found don't ignore the error but investigate and fix your code to make it more reliable. The HTML of that page will certainly change at some point and you should watch out for changes.</p>

<p>Since you use both <code>find</code> and <code>find_all</code>, keep in mind that they behave differently:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If <code>find_all()</code> can’t find anything, it returns an empty list. If <code>find()</code>
  can’t find anything, it returns None</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>find</code> should be used when you are expecting to find only one matching element, not <code>find_all</code>.</p>

<p>FYI <strong>Pandas can also load HTML tables</strong>, just this line of code will give you something:</p>

<pre><code>pandas.read_html(url)
</code></pre>

<p>But since some cleanup is required (parsing a &amp; span tags) you might want to stick with BS (personally I would).</p>

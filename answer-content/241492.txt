<p>A1) Apart from efficiency issues, neither of these methods are <code>pythonic</code> from the Python point of view. But, If I had to choose one, I would choose the second one.
Because, First is not general way in python.</p>

<p>A2) I think it would be better to use <code>List comprehension</code> because it is the most efficient in terms of memory performance. You can check it out on <a href="https://nyu-cds.github.io/python-performance-tips/08-loops/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this site</a></p>

<p>In the case of me,</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code># Using list comprehension

In [1]: current_users = ['MrSplash', 'MrRobot', 'Peter1234', 'Steve', 'James']

In [2]: current_users_lower = [user.lower() for user in current_users]

In [3]: print(current_users_lower)
['mrsplash', 'mrrobot', 'peter1234', 'steve', 'james']
</code></pre>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code># Another way is to use map

In [5]: current_users_lower = list(map(str.lower, current_users))

In [6]: print(current_users_lower)
['mrsplash', 'mrrobot', 'peter1234', 'steve', 'james']

</code></pre>

<p>I think it would be written as above.</p>

<p>cc. python official convention about variable is <code>snake_case</code> not <code>camelCase</code> (I recommend to read PEP8 which is python official style guide)</p>

<p>Happy Coding~</p>

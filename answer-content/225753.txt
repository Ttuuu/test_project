<p>Ok, here my suggestions about your code, I noticed that you used <code>s.length()</code> in your code (two loops and leftpad function), better to store it in a variable and use this variable in your code rewriting loops and leftpad function.</p>

<pre><code>int length = s.length()
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of using <code>s.charAt(i)</code> inside the loops, you can use the String method <code>toCharArray()</code> and memorize the String s into a char array, iterating over it inside the loops. You can rewrite the first loop in this way and the second one with some modifies to the code above avoid consecutive calls of the s <code>charAt(i)</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>char[] arr =s.toCharArray();
int length = s.length();
for (int i = 0; i &lt; length; ++i) {
    binaryString.append(binMap.get(arr[i]));
}
</code></pre>

<p>My concern is about the second parameter you are passing to it because you are doing a division between double numbers and after you cast the result to int, if you already know the result of  <code>s.length() % 4</code> you know that you have to pad your string with <code>4 - s.length() % 4</code> 0 chars if I correctly interpreted the method you posted, so you would avoid the double division and the ceil method too.</p>

<p>Some things that caught my eye:</p>

<p>you don't seem to have any persistent storage just in memory.  I believe you would get more versatility by implementing external persistent storage. The storage can be in several different formats, physical file on disk, a database, cloud storage.</p>

<p>In line with that, it is usually not a very good idea to store passwords as literal strings.  This leaves you prone to hacking.  I would suggest looking at the Cryptography api.</p>

<p>Separate the vault from the GUI.  What happens if you decide to run the vault from a server in a webpage or as a console application?  You basically have to start over again.</p>

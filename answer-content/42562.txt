<li>You may want to be using <code>CancellationToken</code>s via the overload for the async methods of the <code>ClientWebSocket</code> class to properly cleanup tasks on exit.</li>
<li>1024 is usually the value I like to use for web connectivity, the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)1 for Ethernet is 1500 bytes, and I like to round that down to a near exponent of 2, in this case 2^10.</li>
<li>I'm not all sure about the <code>ClientWebSocket</code> class, but you will either get a <code>WebException</code> e.g. 404, I think in the StatusCode, or else it may be that <code>WebSocketStatus</code> you were talking about. Logging these exceptions may be the only thing you can do.</li>
<li>Unless you have access to the source code of the server on the otherside and are able to make changes to it, unless the server implements some way to tell how much data it is sending, there's no way to be sure. An example would be the first 4 bytes of the transmission is the length of the data.</li>

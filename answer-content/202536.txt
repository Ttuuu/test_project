<p>The biggest gain in readability here is to get rid of the duplication. Currently all your strings are hardcoded and you print each of them separately.</p>

<p>We can make life easier by putting the questions, answers and correct answers into some datastructure we can iterate over. In addition, we can bundle these three things together into one <code>Question</code> class (which is just a <code>collections.namedtuple</code> here, so we can give the fields nice names):</p>

<pre><code>from collections import namedtuple

Question = namedtuple("Question", ["question", "answers", "correct_answer"])

GREETING = """Hello {name}, welcome to Quiz night! 
You will be presented with {n} questions.
Enter the appropriate number to answer the question
Good luck!"""

<p>The time complexity of this solution is <code>O(n)</code>, i.e linear time complexity.</p>

<p>Explanation for time complexity to be linear : Here your loops are bounded by the variables <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> and one of them is always being incremented. So in worst case the loop can run only <code>2*len</code> times.</p>

<p>You are right in that most of your code is very similar, except for the file that you are checking. Since only a small part of the code changes, and the same actions are made at every step, this asks for a loop that iterates over the different files that you want to check:</p>

<pre><code>paths_to_check = [".\image_1_01.bmp", ".\image_1_01.raw", ".\image_1_01_hist.csv", ".\image_1_02.bmp", ".\image_1_02.raw", ".\image_1_02_hist.csv", ".\scan_stats.csv"]

for p in paths_to_check:
    if not os.path.exists(p):
        print(p + 'not generated\n' 'for mor info check the log file' )
        return 1
    else:
        shutil.move(p, output_directory)
</code></pre>

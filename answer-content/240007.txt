<p>If the objective is to avoid duplicating information in memory, the code you have given won't archive it.</p>

<p>The <code>new</code> keyword hides the original value. It doesn't replace it. You should try another approximations, like the Decorator pattern: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern</a></p>

<p>The MasterData inherits from the GlobalData class and stores internally the reference to that class. Whenever someone accesses to a property of the GlobalData class, you redirect the request to the instance stored internally.</p>

<p>The MasterData class stores only the values of the newly added properties.</p>

<p>The tricky part would be preventing other parts of your MasterApplication app calling to the GlobalData class and thus creating another instance.</p>

<p>Singletons are always a nightmare...</p>

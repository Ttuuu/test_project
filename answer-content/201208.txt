<p>Putting aside that this should be actually done in an init-list, here you create 100 objects yet claim you only have <code>n</code> of them. While being okay for simple types, this may not always be a good case (imagine an object that, by default, creates a TCP connection to a default address overseas.) It would probably make more sense to make <code>data</code> an uninitialized storage, storing objects in it as needed.</p>

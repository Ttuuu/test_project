<p><code>500</code> and <code>1000</code> should be constants.</p>

<p>Where you have them now you need to look through to find them in code when you want to change them. I know this is an example, but they're also meaningless. <code>500</code> doesn't tell you why half a second matters, but <code>TIMEOUT</code> tells you what the purpose of the number is. Declare your time values at the top of the function with clear names that denote what they're for.</p>

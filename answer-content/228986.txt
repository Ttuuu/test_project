<p>Limit globbing to directories only by appending a slash:  <code>for dir in */</code></p>

<p>If you <code>cd</code> into subdirectories, you don't need to construct a new path for each file.  If you <code>cd</code> inside a subshell with <code>( cd â€¦ )</code>, the original directory will be restored when subshell exits.  Make sure to increment <code>n</code> <em>outside</em> of the subshell, or the new value will be lost!</p>

<p>The <code>IFS=</code> is not needed; bash will split the filenames properly.  You just need to quote the variable when you refer to it.</p>

<pre><code>n=0
for d in */ ; do
    ( cd "$d" &amp;&amp; for f in * ; do mv  "$f" $n"_$f" ; done )
    (( n++ ))
done
</code></pre>

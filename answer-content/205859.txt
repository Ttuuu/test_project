<p>It would be a good idea for the <code>Queue</code> class to offer a <code>.size()</code> method, so that the caller can avoid popping an empty queue.</p>

<p>While your memory-management technique will work, it is not efficient.  If you repeatedly push and pop elements, you'll end up reallocating the array quite a bit.  Furthermore, when you call <code>.doubleSize()</code>, you end up copying <em>all</em> of the old array elements, including the ones before the <code>head</code> that have already been popped and are no longer relevant.</p>

<p>A better design would be to use the array as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">circular buffer</a>, growing it only when the capacity is exceeded.</p>

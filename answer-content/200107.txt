<p>It seems you're trying to turn Java into REST - i.e. you'd like to strip the types of your results so you can return anything.</p>

<p>If you do that, <code>Object</code> is the common base class unless you introduce a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marker_interface_pattern" rel="nofollow noreferrer">marker  interface</a>. </p>

<p>A marker interface would allow you to find out when your code suddenly tries to return something else (for example, when an attacker has found a way to access internal objects via REST).</p>

<p>That said, you should be master of your API. When doing REST, other people will talk to your app. If you're unable to tell which objects are returned, then debugging will become quite hard.</p>

<p>Also, people will not like using your API when you change result objects all the time, breaking their code.</p>

<p>Therefore, I suggest that you at least create classes of objects which all implement the same interfaces to make sure you always return a set of known attributes. That will allow you to supply those objects from different sources while being able to tell in advance when something is going to break.</p>

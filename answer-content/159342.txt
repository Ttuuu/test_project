<ul>
<li>Do you really want this function to use loose comparison <code>$array[$i] != 0</code>?  What should intended behavior be for other potentially falsey values at the end of the array (<code>false</code>, <code>""</code>, <code>[]</code>, etc.)?  If you truly only want to replace only trailing zeroes, then you <strong>must</strong> use exact comparison here <code>!==</code>.</li>
<li>Your function name seems unclear with regards to what the function does.  Perhaps <code>arrayPadOverTrailingZeroes</code>, <code>arrayPadOverTrailingEmptyValues</code> (depending on desired behavior).</li>
<li>PHP provides built-in array functions that may clean up this code a little bit (and perhaps perform slightly better since they are compiled).</li>
</ul>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>function arrayPadOverTrailingZeroes($array) {
    $length = count($array);
    while (($value = end($array)) === 0) {
        array_pop($array);
    }
    // This conditional to support case where you have all zeroes,
    // in which case, the while loop above would have discarded all array members
    // and $value would be set to false
    if (count($array) === 0) {
        $value = 0;
    }
    return array_pad($array, $length, $value);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Answered this before I saw your all-zeroes use case.  Added some additional logic above to handle this case.</p>

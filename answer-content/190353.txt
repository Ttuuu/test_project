<p>I see you want to use pointers and so maybe you should use pointer safe methods -</p>

<pre><code>Private Declare PtrSafe Sub CopyMemory Lib "kernel32.dll" Alias "RtlMoveMemory" (ByVal Destination As LongPtr, ByVal source As LongPtr, ByVal Length As LongPtr) 
</code></pre>

<p>All the <code>Long</code> should also be <code>LongPtr</code>.</p>

<p>That being said <code>StrPtr</code> is undocumented and the user will get a <em>type mismatch</em> (at least on 64bit) unless <code>bufferPointer as LongPtr</code> is declared.</p>

<p>Same goes for <code>Dim expressionPointer As LongPtr</code>.</p>

<p>Otherwise, I think this is pretty clever, kudos.</p>

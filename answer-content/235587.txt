<p>Neither C nor C++ are the friendliest languages to get acquainted with programming, and character I/O is not their forte either. Besides, these raw C arrays/pointers are both an eyesore and a headache.</p>

<pre><code>int temp,    letter   = 0;
</code></pre>

<p>I wouldn't mix uninitialized and initialized variables.
For an educational code, each variable should be on a separate line with a comment defining its role.</p>

<p>This tinkering with EOFs and newlines is painful to watch. Handling errors is certainly a part of a programmer's job, but I would rather start with a program that can be read without prior knowledge of circa 1970 technicalities and introduce the gritty details only later.</p>

<p>I'd rather use <code>getline()</code> on <code>stdin</code> (letting the runtime handle this messy string allocation and terminators business) and <code>atoi()</code> to handle wrong input as simply as possible.<br>
Or possibly use <code>argc</code>, <code>argv</code> to get rid of the I/O scan altogether, though the notion of command line arguments might not be terribly intuitive either at first glance.</p>

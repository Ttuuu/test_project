<p>Andrew, it looks good. I use XP and JDK6.07 and haven't had any problems when browsing or using New/Delete/Rename functionality.</p>

<p>A couple of comments:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The Icon header and all the check box headers are truncated and show "...". The following fixed it for me:</p>

<pre><code>//            width = (int)preferred.getWidth()+10;  
              width = (int)preferred.getWidth()+14;
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>I found the reading the text of a selected node difficult. It is black text on a dark blue background. The JTable was much easier to read with white text on a dark blue background. I see the default tree renderer also supports text selection/non-selection colours.</p></li>
<li><p>If you really want to give users a bang for their buck, then maybe when deleting a directory you can prompt the user to see if they want to delete all the files first before deleting the directory.</p></li>
</ol>

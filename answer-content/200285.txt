<p>Another approach is to sort your list what is O(n log n) complexity and then compare only two adjacent elements which is O(n). Combined O(n log n). If there are duplicate they will be next to each other in a sorted list. Just pass a list with number to this function and it will give you a list with numbers that are duplicate. Or an empty list if there are no duplicate.</p>

<pre><code>#nums is a list with numbers

def find_duplicate(nums):
    dublicates = []
    nums.sort()
    for i in range(len(nums)-1):
       if nums[i] == nums[i+1]:
          dublicates.append(nums[i])
    return dublicates

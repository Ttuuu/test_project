<p>The suggested code might be considered better because it has less duplicate code. In this case most of the HTML strings are duplicated in your first example. Code with less duplication is less work and less error prone to change. For example, if the classes for the outer div needed to be changed, then in your example you would have to change two places instead of one, and you might forget to change one of the two places, causing a bug. </p>

<p>For a case like this, where there are only two cases, and the two pieces of code are nearby the benefits are smaller than if there were more cases than true or false. Say there was a partially-completed state that needed to be added. Whether it makes sense to reduce duplication in this particular case is a matter of opinion, I would argue, since it does make the code a little more complicated. It might be fine or even better to just wait until the next time the requirements change, since then you will know more about how the code should be at that point. If there were 10 different cases, then the duplication and therefore the chances of making a mistake go up, so it would be clearer what the right choice is. </p>

<p>According to PEP 526, the initializer isn't needed.  Have you tried:</p>
<pre><code>class Window:
    def __init__(self):
        self.image: Optional[Image]    # &lt;== this is just a type hint, no initialization

    def build(self, path):
        self.image = Image(path)
</code></pre>
<p>I don't use PyCharm, so I don't know if it would still complain.</p>
    </div>

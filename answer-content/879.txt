<p>Why not divide the number of unique characters in the given string by the total number of characters in that string. That would give a more accurate measure of entropy.</p>

<p>For example, going by your formula, an entropy of 3 for a string of 5 characters should be fine but an entropy of 3 for a string of 8 characters is poor. But, your formula wouldn't be able to differentiate between the two results. Whereas, the above given formula would do so to give a more accurate measure.</p>

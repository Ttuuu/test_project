<h2><code>main()</code></h2>

<ol>
<li><p>it is considered bad practice for the <code>main()</code> method. at the very least, it is customary to catch all exceptions and print the stack trace to allow debugging. </p></li>
<li><p>All IO resources (files, network sockets, DB connetions, etc) should be closed <em>before</em> the program exits. Java 7 has introduced the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/tryResourceClose.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">try-with-resources Statement</a> where the compiler ensures proper closure of resources in all control flows (including exceptions)</p></li>
</ol>

<h2><code>reverseWords()</code></h2>

<p>I do not see any branch where <code>endIndex</code> is not advanced. so why is this performed separately for each branch? it can, and should, be done in one place.</p>

<h2>Unit tests</h2>

<p>the unit tests are missing cases of null input, empty string input, string with one word, string with multiple spaces between words: <code>"multi    space   between    words"</code>, string with tab character instead of space between words.</p>

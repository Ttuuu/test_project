<ul>
<li><p>I recommend writing <code>session_start();</code> first and unconditionally.</p></li>
<li><p><code>!empty()</code> performs two checks: if the variable <code>isset()</code> AND contains a non-falsey value.  This means <code>$obj != null</code> is not necessary.  That said, your <code>while()</code> loop will halt if <code>$obj</code> is falsey.</p></li>
<li><p>There's nothing wrong with using prepared statements, but for the record your first query will be just as stable/secure without it.</p></li>
<li><p>I noticed <code>mysqli_close($db);</code>. You should keep all of your query syntax object-oriented.</p></li>
<li><p>Rather than declaring new variables to feed to <code>$stmt-&gt;bind_param()</code> (single-use variables), just write the original variables as parameters.  There isn't much benefit in adding more variables to global scope.</p></li>
<li><p>It looks like all roads lead to: </p>

<pre><code>header("Location: ../");
</code></pre>

<p>If this is true for you actual project script, write a single <code>if</code> block, then whether its contents are executed or not, after the condition block execute your redirect.</p></li>
</ul>

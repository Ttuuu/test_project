<p>You are discarding the return values of the <code>fread()</code> calls, blindly assuming that they both successfully read 16 bytes.</p>

<p>It is unclear what the return value of <code>compare_two_binary_files(…, …)</code> means.  In fact, you sometimes don't return a value at all.  Your compiler should have warned you about that problem.</p>

<p>File I/O should be done a block at a time: 512 bytes, 1024 bytes, or 2048 bytes would be a more reasonable chunk size than 16.</p>

<p>Technically, most of the time is spent waiting for I/O.  <code>cpu_time_taken</code> is a misnomer: what you're measuring is called "wall clock time".</p>

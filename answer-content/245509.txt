<p>The only obvious thing I see is that your <code>realloc</code> machinery is too complicated given the task at hand. Your entire word file is only 530 KB. You could easily iterate over the entire file to count newlines and get the exact array length you need, and this would be done quite quickly.</p>
<p>If alignment of the resulting strings is crucial, you'd want to keep your current method of <code>malloc</code>ing a copy of every single line. If not, there is a much simpler solution: read the entire file into memory in one big blob, null out the newlines, and then form a secondary array of pointers into that blob.</p>

<p>Maybe try a two step process:</p>

<p>First, convert the Json to XML. Various libraries can do the conversion.
Second, use LINQ to query the XML. LINQ documentation has examples.</p>

<p>Expanding upon this answer. The original poster wanted less cumbersome code. Well, why reinvent the wheel?  Converting the Json to XML can be done with one line of code (assuming a library function). LINQ is an query language for accessing data stored in enumerable objects like XML.  All the "name" elements can be extracted in one (or more, depending on code formatting style) line of code. That is less cumbersome than the original posters code.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I'm not sure of any way of being more concise.</p>

<p>There are a few changes you could make, but they're mostly optional.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Check the return value of <code>CreateToolhelp32Snapshot()</code>. The documentation says the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Includes all modules of the process specified in th32ProcessID in the
  snapshot. To enumerate the modules, see Module32First. <strong>If the function
  fails with ERROR_BAD_LENGTH, retry the function until it succeeds.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I use <code>CreateToolhelp32Snapshot()</code> in an application that runs 24/7 and I know for a fact that I get the <code>ERROR_BAD_LENGTH</code> error here and there. In my case, I cannot afford false negatives, so I have to put this function in a loop. If you are okay with having false-negatives occasionally, then I wouldn't worry too much about it.</p></li>
<li><p>I don't know if you're showing us the full code for this function, but you have a memory leak here:</p>

<p><code>ModuleNameChar = new WCHAR[Chars];</code></p>

<p>I don't see where you are deleting this buffer. I personally would use an <code>std::vector&lt;WCHAR&gt;</code> as a buffer, give it the correct size, and pass the address of the first element to <code>MultiByteToWideChar()</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>If you use <code>HANDLE</code>s a lot, consider wrapping them in an RAII container. That way, you don't have to worry about closing them manually. This will also make your code exception-safe if you ever add any functions that can throw (you actually already have one that can throw, the <code>new</code> call).</p></li>
<li><p>I noticed you're not calling <code>::Module32First()</code>. You probably don't need it, but I always have it anyway.</p></li>
<li><p>This is a personal preference, but I think your upper-case variable names look absolutely horrendous. Please use snake-case or camel-case for variable names.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There's really nothing helpful to say unfortunately, the Windows API can be quite cumbersome.</p>

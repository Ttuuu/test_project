<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>Just a quick note about naming:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>bool Increased100500 = false;
bool Increased5001500 = false;
bool Increased15003000 = false;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Please, don't do that. I mean, yeah, <em>private fields should be <code>camelCase</code></em> in the first place, but that chunk of numbers is fairly annoying, and it <strong>encodes your game logic into an identifier</strong>.</p>

<p>If you wanted to change your levels, let alone making them configurable, then what's <code>100500</code> going to tell the maintainer?</p>

<p>Consider using names like this instead:</p>

<pre><code>var increasedLevel1 = false;
var increasedLevel2 = false;
var increasedLevel3 = false;
</code></pre>

<p>That's still encoding 3 difficulty levels into the identifiers, but at least the thresholds aren't part of the variables' names, so it's a start.</p>

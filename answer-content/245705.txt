<p>Time complexity of Orignal Solution u made : O(i)--only using a for loop.
Time complexity of your new solution Containing enum:  as you are using enum it takes time O(n) and then u are running a for loop O(i),which you can see in your run time.some overhead from enum can be seen.
Note:there comes time with using function (everything is not ultra fast or optimal).</p>

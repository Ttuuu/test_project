<p>Let's break-down your existing code:</p>

<pre><code>if os.path.isfile("file.gz"):
    with gzip.GzipFile("file.gz", 'r') as fin:   
        for line in fin:
</code></pre>

<p>The above code would work faster if you made this into a separate function and loaded the file fully first (perform all the I/O in a single operation, loading the data into the memory (much faster), rather than keeping the loop as incrementing the file pointer to read the next line). I/O is slow, always try to get files into a memory structure before doing anything.</p>

<pre><code>            if get_new_user is True:
</code></pre>

<p>This line would be evaluated every single time the loop runs. We should avoid that.</p>

<pre><code>                if datetime.strptime(json.loads(line).get('UpdatedAt'), '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ').date() == (datetime.today()-timedelta(1)).date():
</code></pre>

<p>This line executes datetime.today() every single time the loop hits this line. Again, something to avoid by placing the operation result into a variable, before the loop runs.</p>

<pre><code>                    users.append(json.loads(line))
            else:
                users.append(json.loads(line))    
</code></pre>

<p>This is the same line - both sides of the if statement run this exact statement regardless of the result of the date check - meaning the date check is kind of useless - <strong>AND</strong> the load operation is duplicated/can be separated, right? Perhaps you are missing a line of code? perhaps this is a logic error? It would be helpful to get a comment regarding this.</p>

<pre><code>    os.remove("file.gz")
    return users
</code></pre>

<p>you miss the initial declaration of the users data type. This statement will return either <code>None</code> or (I'm guessing) a list (because you use <code>.append()</code>).</p>

<p>With these comments, you should be able to make a piece of code that does something like (<strong>this is pseudocode</strong>):</p>

<pre><code>function return_file_data(filename)
  if file_exists(filename)
   data = filename.read_all() #including gunzip
   remove(filename)

  return data or None

function process_data(data)
  users = []
  for line in data
    users.append(json.loads(line))

  return users

function main(filename)
  data = return_file_data(filename)
  if data
    users = process_data(data)
    # do something with the users data

if __name__ == "__main__":
  filename = get_filename() # I'm sure you do that somewhere?
  main(filename)
</code></pre>

<p>You'll notice I dropped the datetime comparison <strong>AND</strong> the get_new_user flag comparison - for reasons mentioned earlier. If you improve your code (as per codereview guidelines), create a new post (with your new code) and reference this post for historical purposes.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

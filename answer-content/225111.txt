<p>I think it would be better to generate the 漢字 versions of the numbers, as it's  more useful in general. Make a separate class responsible for romanization (or phonetic conversion in general so it can support kana).</p>

<p>Using kanji also allows for somewhat trivially adding support for formal numbers (大字), which is kind of cool/useful.</p>

<p>I would also recommend adding support for breaking up the romaji sequences as reading very large numbers in romaji with no spaces is not at all fun. It could be an optional flag. A natural place to add spaces would be between magnitudes at least, or maybe between all of the various groupings you've already put together (ones, tens, hundreds, etc.).</p>

<p>As for using romaji to avoid encoding issues, I recommending biting the bullet and learning how to support Unicode correctly as it will be extremely useful.</p>

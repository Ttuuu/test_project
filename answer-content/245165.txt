<p>As we do not know the task given we cannot fully review. While the code itself looks reasonable there is some smell.</p>
<h1>date</h1>
<p>To me it is very smelly, that a function named <code>id()</code> returns a date</p>
<pre><code>start_date = ids('DIR', '348')
</code></pre>
<p>This is also requiring a switch inside your function, so most probably there are two functions intermingled that should not be.</p>
<h1>data structure</h1>
<p><code>list()</code> is a bad structure to search in. While this may be the data format you read or get passed, you most probably should convert it to a structure allowing direct lookup (converting once). The description of the current structure is missing, also we do not know if there are other functions accessing the data.</p>

<p>Don't do <code>using namespace std</code> in global scope, instead use it inside the functions or even better only on the things you are using:</p>

<pre><code>int main()
{
  using std::cout;
  ...
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>In your main, you have <code>exit(0)</code>, instead you should do a return statement.</p>

<pre><code>return EXIT_SUCCESS;
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>You don't have a default case in your <code>switch</code> statements, so if a user enters the wrong number nothing happens and the program ends without notice. It is better to have some kind of error handling. You should also do a function that shows a number of options and lets the user enter a value that is returned if correct, that way you save some typing.</p>

<p>e.g.</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * show a number choices and lets the user choose one
 * @returns 1-n
 */
int promptUser( const std::vector&lt;std::string&gt;&amp; options );
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Your program has the structure of a C program, you should use classes to encapsulate functionality. Identify the objects in the story and create appropriate classes.</p>

<p>e.g. Aragorn, Thief, Player have some common traits</p>

<hr>

<pre><code>system("pause"); 
</code></pre>

<p>Calling external programs like that is not a good thing, it opens up a security hole in your application instead use std::getline or similar.</p>

<hr>

<p>You forgot to initialize some variables e.g.</p>

<pre><code>int gold;   &lt;---
int sword;

gold = gold + 20;
</code></pre>

<p>Always make it a habit to initialize variables when you declare them.</p>

<hr>

<p>Don't call <code>main()</code>. It makes the program flow difficult to follow, instead have a loop in <code>main()</code> if you want to allow restart of the game.</p>

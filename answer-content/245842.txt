<p>Something smells funny here:</p>
<pre><code>    self.head = 'HEAD'
    self.tail = 'TAIL'
    self.connect(self.head, self.tail)

def connect(self, node_a: int, node_b: int) -&gt; None:
</code></pre>
<p>Those are strings, not integers. Briefly looking through your code, there's nothing requiring that your node keys be integers; they only need to be <em>hashable</em>. This is probably what you want to use for your type hints:</p>

<p>Beyond that, though, I question using those strings for HEAD and TAIL. It would be safer to make sentinel objects <code>self.head = object(); self.tail = object()</code> that will not match anything the user provides.</p>

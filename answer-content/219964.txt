<p>Your passwords will be biased, with more letters appearing towards the front of the password and more digits towards the end.</p>

<p>A better approach would be to determine how many digits you will have in the password. Then, for each character, determine if it should be a digit based on the number of digits you want to have and the number of characters left to fill by checking if (random(characters_left) &lt; digits_left).  Then select either a random digit or letter for that position.</p>

<p>When you declare <code>pass</code>, you don't need to pass it an empty string.  It is default constructed as empty.</p>

<pre><code>std::string pass;
</code></pre>

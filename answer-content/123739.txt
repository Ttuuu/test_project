<p>Overall very nice programming. I am glad that you correctly declared and implemented <code>ApproximateStringMatcher</code>.</p>

<p>In your <code>Miscellanea.min</code> method you could have used <code>min = Math.min(min, ints[i])</code> instead of that <code>if</code>.</p>

<p>I would consider to think about the <code>Miscellanea.delta</code> method. 
The only thing he is doing is to do a ternary, I wonder if I preferred to have that code in place so I didn't have the need to navigate the method to see what it does.
Aside of this what you definitely want to do is to have a variable to store the result so you shorten the <code>g[i][j]</code> assignment.</p>

<pre><code>public List&lt;Integer&gt; match(String text, String pattern, int maximumEditDistance) {
   //...
    for (int j = 1; j &lt;= n; ++j) {
        for (int i = 1; i &lt;= top; ++i) {
            //consider to do the ternary here instead
            int delta = delta(pattern.charAt(i - 1), text.charAt(j - 1)); 
            g[i][j] = min(g[i - 1][j - 1] + delta, g[i - 1][j] + 1, g[i][j - 1] + 1);
        }
        //...
    }
    //...
}
</code></pre>

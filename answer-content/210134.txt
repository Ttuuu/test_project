<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>Based on your stated use case:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I would like to rerun the function if the new list contains more than one element.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>you don't even need to return a list; just return the highest element's roll and name, which can be unpacked by the caller as a 2-tuple:</p>

<pre><code>def comp(rolls):
    return max(rolls)
</code></pre>

<p>That said, you haven't explicitly stated how to resolve ties with rolls of the same value. That will affect this solution.</p>

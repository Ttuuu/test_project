<p>I am not a pro coder but to my eye your try/catch block seems very correct. You did covered all types of error that may occur during the execution of the code if given an incorrect input. 
I would say that the exception handling is implemented correctly.<br>
For the second question, most coders would agree that it is a good practice to drop everything that is not required in the code and removing stuff that would not effect the functionality a tiny bit. These pieces of code may increase the execution and compile time which is a judging factor in many coding competitions. 
In your case, removing the header files that are not required in the code is a good practice.</p>

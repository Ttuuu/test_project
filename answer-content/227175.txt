<p><strong>There are dragons in your code</strong> I must say you beat me with this API. I usually build strange things but the way you misuse the <code>ValidationResult</code> here is remarkable. Every single method returns a <code>ValidationResult&lt;T&gt;</code> or some kind. I needed a while to figure out that you aren't actually validating anything.</p>

<p><strong>Use a true monad</strong> If you want this kind of monad for results that may fail or not then you should use something that is built for this purpose and doesn't confuse the user. Like the <code>Task</code> that you are already using. In this case you wrapped one of them in another one. You can however create your own like the <a href="https://medium.com/@dimpapadim3/either-is-a-common-type-in-functional-languages-94b86eea325c" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Either Monad</a>.</p>

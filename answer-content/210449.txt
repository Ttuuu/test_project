<h1>Docstrings</h1>

<p>You should really consider switching to <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Docstrings</a> instead of using your current documentation method. (Note that using Docstrings will give the function a <code>.__doc__</code> property which can be used for a variety including documentation generation). So for instance:</p>

<pre><code># Wrapper function around syslog to allow default priority of INFO, but
# has the ability to change the priority if wished for a given message.
def _syslog(message: AnyStr, priority: int = syslog.LOG_INFO) -&gt; None:
    syslog.syslog(priority, message)
</code></pre>

<p>Would (well, almost) become:</p>

<pre><code>def _syslog(message: AnyStr, priority: int = syslog.LOG_INFO) -&gt; None:
    """
    Wrapper function around syslog to allow default priority of INFO, but
    has the ability to change the priority if wished for a given message.
    """
    syslog.syslog(priority, message)
</code></pre>

<p>However, there are couple remarks to make:</p>

<ol>
<li>The Docstring comment I have linked tends to have the summary on the same line as the <code>"""</code>, but <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/24385103/667648">many conventions disregard this</a>.</li>
<li>You should probably mention the arguments and return values (when applicable of course.)</li>
</ol>

<h1>Wrap it in a class?</h1>

<p>Admittedly, I don't know too much about the domain you are working with, and similarly, I don't really like promoting OOP since I find often too overused, but here is my rational:</p>

<ol>
<li>You have a lot of globals like <code>DNS_NAMESERVER</code>, <code>ZONE</code>, <code>DOMAIN</code> etc, these could be given default values in your class and made private variables. (On the other hand, you might actually want these constant, in which case ignore this.)</li>
<li>A lot of your functions have default values which could be instead omitted and placed as class variables.</li>
</ol>

<p>On the other hand, I may not know enough about what you're doing. If you disagree with this assessment, just look at the first critique.</p>

<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>Your code has an error in the definition of father.
In ruby, there is no need to add self as a parameter.
In addition you return an array with the mother. This may be correct under some legal systems, but I think you didn't want to implement this..</p>
<p>It is fine, if you use:</p>
<pre><code>def father()
  return self.mother.spouse
end
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can use it as <code>son.father</code>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Ruby defines instance variables as <code>@varname</code>, you can use them inside the class.</p>
<p>If you want to have access from outside, you must define accessors (setter, getter or both). From outside you don't see a difference between accessors and "normal" methods. You call a method and get a result.</p>
<p>Inside a class I recommend to use the accessor if it is defined. If you ever replace the standard accessor with a programm logic, then you don't need to adapt the code.</p>

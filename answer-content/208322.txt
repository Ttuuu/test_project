<p>Some suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Run the code through at least one linter such as flake8 or pycodestyle to produce more idiomatic code.</li>
<li>Don't read all the lines into a variable before starting processing - this will slow things down and use much more memory than necessary for large files. Instead you can use <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/1478697/96588"><code>for line in file.readlines()</code></a>.</li>
<li>You are doing ten calculations in order to run a single print statement. Either get rid of them or do something simpler like <code>print("{}/{} complete".format(k, long))</code>.</li>
<li>If you <em>know</em> <code>y</code> has exactly one newline at the end you can do <code>y[:-1]</code> instead of <code>y.rstrip('\n')</code>.</li>
<li>Capitalizing each word is expensive. Avoid it if at all possible.</li>
<li>If you don't need a bunch of the fields in an input file add a limit to your <code>split()</code> and mark the last stuff as discarded by using the <code>_</code> variable. For example: <code>usr, hshd, _ = x.split(':', 3)</code></li>
<li>Rather than keeping track of <code>k</code> manually you can just do <code>for k, y in enumerate(grupo1)</code>.</li>
<li>Rather than having a list of usernames and a list of their hashed passwords, a <code>Dict[str, str]</code> of username to hash should be easier to keep track of.</li>
</ul>

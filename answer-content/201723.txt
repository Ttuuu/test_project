<p><code>Start()</code> is spawning an infinite number of new tasks without waiting for them to complete. It's also a bit weird that <code>Start()</code> is blocking the calling thread.</p>

<p>Make <code>Start()</code> async and await the <code>Task</code> returned by <code>Task.Run</code>.</p>

<p><code>Start()</code>, a blocking method, being called at the end of the constructor is an absolute no-go. The constructor is not done, the object initialization is never completed.</p>

<p>Unless you're living on UTC <code>(DateTime.Now - lastProcessed).TotalSeconds</code> is going to be inconsistent around daylight saving transitions.</p>

<p>Having a single test case is by far not enough. Here are some more test cases that you should try.</p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>""
"\t"
"word"
" word "
"don't do that"
"what about hyphen-ated words?"
"and these â€” how many are these?"
"naÃ¯ve"
"naiÌˆve"
"ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€"
</code></pre>
<p>If your code handles all of these correctly (that is: exactly as you would expect), it's good.</p>
<p>You should declare the method <code>countWords</code> as <code>public static int</code>. The <code>static</code> keyword means that you don't have to create an unnecessary <code>WordCount</code> object just to call this method. Instead, you can call that method as <code>WordCount.countWords("word")</code>.</p>
<p>In your <code>countWords</code> method, you have a bit of code duplication:</p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>str.charAt(i) == ' ' || str.charAt(i) == '\n' || str.charAt(i) == '\t'
</code></pre>
<p>In the above code, the expression <code>str.charAt(i)</code> appears 3 times. The code becomes easier understandable if you create a separate method for this purpose:</p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>private static boolean isSpace(char c) {
    return c == ' ' || c == '\n' || c == '\t';
}
</code></pre>
<p>And since it is a common task to test whether a character is a space, there's a predefined method for this. It is called <code>Character.isWhitespace</code>. You should probably use that instead of defining your own.</p>
<p>By the way, it is not easy to define what exactly a "word" is and how to split a text into words. Similar to defining what a "character" is. If you want to dig deeper into this topic, have a look at <a href="https://unicode.org/reports/tr29/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Unicode Text Segmentation</a>, which contains way more details and edge cases than you ever wanted to know.</p>

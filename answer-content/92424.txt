<p>You should not need a special class for this. Method references can be cast to functional interfaces. In this particular case, however, remember that the stream returned by <code>Files::lines</code> needs to be closed to prevent leaks:</p>

<pre><code>try (Stream s = Files.lines(...)) {
  for (String v : (Iterable&lt;String&gt;) s::iterator) {
      ...
  }
}
</code></pre>
    </div>

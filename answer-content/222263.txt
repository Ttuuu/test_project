<p>One thing I would add would be to describe what your inputs should be, and to check if they are indeed the correct input type. For small scripts it's not that pressing, but in my experience it can make debugging much easier in the future.</p>

<p>I've also copied @Peilonrayz suggestion because I agree with it.</p>

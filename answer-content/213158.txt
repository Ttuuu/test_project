<li><p>The comment</p>

<pre><code>In each iteration, two weakest countries are selected, after which the two battle.
</code></pre>

<p>seems misleading. Correct me if I am wrong, but the algorithm select two <em>strongest</em> countries.</p></li>
<li><p>It doesn't seem right to pass <code>expectedWinner</code> to <code>WarScheduler</code>. The expected winner is not scheduled for any battle, and the only thing the scheduler does with it is removing it from the queue. I recommend to prune it in <code>main</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>A battle creating new country is an interesting geopolitical concept. In this case, however, making countries mutable seems more reasonable.</p>

<p>In particular, since the scheduler already knows which country is stronger, consider a </p>

<pre><code>Battle Country::defeat(Country other)
</code></pre>

<p>method, which adjusts the winner's potential. Notice that the <code>Battle</code> itself is now reduced purely to a historical record, and doesn't need to know intimate details of <code>Country</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>An opportunistic optimization is to keep the running tally of the remaining potentials. Once it becomes less than the potential of the expected winner, the order of remaining battles does not matter.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>A 2x2x2 Cube has 6 faces each composed of 4 smaller faces (which we can call facelets) for a total of 24 facelets.</p>

<p>However, you do not need to model them all individually as the cube is composed of two 2x2 layers of smaller cubes (cubelets) and the orientation of the facelets 
is fixed on each cubelet.</p>

<p>The 8 cubelets can be in <code>8!</code> permutations of positions and 7-of-the-8 cubelets can be independently rotated to any one of 3 orientations (the orientation of the last is dependent on the the orientation of the others) so there are <code>3^7</code> different orientations of cubelets. There are 6 ways of picking the top face and then 4 ways of picking the front face so there are 24 different orientations of the cube which have the same permutation and orientation of cubelets - if you fix the orientation of the faces then you can eliminate this factor of 24. So there are:</p>

<p>$$\frac{8!\cdot{}3^7}{24}=3,674,160$$</p>

<p>Possible permutations of the cube.</p>

<p>You can then pick several different approaches:</p>

<ol>
<li>Brute force - the problem size is not particularly big and you can pack the orientation of the cube into a single 32-bit integer (3,674,160 will fit in 22 bits leaving 10 bits to encode the optimal move towards solving the cube) so with ~14Mb memory you can represent the entire problem. You then just need to enumerate all the different permutations of the cube and then start with the solved cube and perform a breadth-first search of the problem space scrambling it until you have reached all permutations. This will then give you the optimal solution for every cube (but will take a long time to generate the initial result).</li>
<li>Use a depth-first (with a maximum iteration depth) or breadth-first search to <a href="http://www.rubiksplace.com/cubes/2x2/" rel="noreferrer">solve the cube in small incremental steps</a>. Start by solving a 2x1x1 section of the cube then build on this so a 2x2x1 layer is solved then solve the opposite facelets (ignoring the orientation of the sides) then finally orientate the sides correctly to solve the entire cube. This is likely to generate sub-optimal solutions but it will generate each incremental step fairly quickly.</li>
</ol>

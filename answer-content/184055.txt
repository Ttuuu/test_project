<p>It seems like assigning a value like in the answer from @austin-hastings doesn't work. I fiddled a bit more and found that just using his conditionals in a mask does work (the boolean is a little different, but that is besides the point):</p>

<pre><code>mask = ((greens &lt; 35) | (reds &gt;= greens) | (blues &gt;= greens)) * 255
</code></pre>

<p>this creates a single layer (one color) mask that I can write out to a file:</p>

<pre><code>cv2.imwrite("result.jpg", mmask)
</code></pre>

<p>I guess using it as a blue colour is not hard, but not relevant for my application. (In fact, a white mask is even better)</p>

<p>I don't have enough reputation to leave a comment, but I highly recommend checking out NexusForever : <a href="https://github.com/NexusForever/NexusForever/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/NexusForever/NexusForever/</a></p>

<p>It is also a game server emulator, and their implementation seems close to yours. It has been a great resource for me, and I hope it can help you too.</p>

<p>I think your packets should only read the incoming data. 
Processing can be done in a handler, which takes a Packet and a NetworkClient, so that your packets simply read data. The logic is then processed in another class/method. I say this because I see you pass NetworkClient in "Process". I have had the same type of system before, and it can become very unmaintainable.</p>

<p>Your packet reader class seems fine, in most emulators I've seen, it is always implemented this way.</p>

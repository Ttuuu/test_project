<p>I am also self-taught and do it much the same as you.</p>

<p>For a different reason (wanted to periodically run functions) I was looking for "time until execute" logging, anyway, I codged this together after reading several examples (including this page).</p>

<pre><code>def secs_to_dhms(seconds):
    from datetime import datetime, timedelta    
    d = datetime(1,1,1) + timedelta(seconds=int(seconds))
    output = "{:02}:{:02}:{:02}:{:02}" .format(d.day-1, d.hour, d.minute, d.second)
    return output
</code></pre>

<p>Not exactly what you wanted, but maybe of use to you, anyway.</p>

<p>Your code is overall pretty clean!</p>

<p>I'd change the name of the method <code>check_size</code> to maybe <code>filter_by_size</code>. The reason behind this is that I'd expect a function that starts with <code>check</code> to return a <code>boolean</code>, not a <code>list</code>, which makes a line like this : <code>photos = check_size(all_images, min_dimension)</code> kind of weird. In the <code>check_size</code> method, there's another weird thing : </p>

<p>You  check if the smallest dimension of your image is bigger than your min dimension. I feel like that's a weird requirement, but if that's what you want, I'd consider making it very clear that's what's happening in this method by adding a docstring to your method. Otherwise, if I have an image of <code>1000x100</code> and <code>min_dim = 200</code>, by reading the method's name I don't know what would happen.</p>

<p>In the <code>photo_search</code> method, you have this comment : <code>get a list of all photos present in folder</code>, but that's not what's happening in the line below. Which brings me to my point, you should only have comments when it's a certainty that someone reading your code wouldn't understand what the code's supposed to do, otherwise you end up having deprecated comments (that's the hard reality of development). To conclude this point, I think that all of your comments shouldn't be there, your code is clear as it is.</p>

<p>In the <code>save_data</code> method, I think you should have a method argument to decide what format to save your output into, because I'd be inclined to believe you most of the time don't use both of the outputs (but I might be wrong).</p>

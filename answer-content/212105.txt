<p>In reply to "Are there any other possible significant optimizations that could help the algorithm?"</p>

<p>I don't know, and it may have no effect at all, or even reduce performance, but I would like to know if reducing the apparent number of array operations improves performance, for example change</p>

<pre><code>    if (arr[m1] == search) return m1;
    if (arr[m2] == search) return m2;

    if (arr[m1] &lt; search) {
        if (arr[m2] &lt; search) {
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>    Type am1 = arr[m1], am2 = arr[m2];
    if (am1 == search) return m1;
    if (am2 == search) return m2;

    if (am1 &lt; search) {
        if (am2 &lt; search) {
</code></pre>

<p>Apart from that, with regard to "Are there any other comments about my code?" could I suggest using say <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> instead of <code>l</code> and <code>r</code> as variable names. <code>l</code> is very easy to mistake for <code>1</code>!</p>

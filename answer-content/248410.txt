<p>The <code>parseInt(eggWeight);</code> calls are not doing anything, because you are not using its return value. And since you aren't using the return value, the comparisons are all comparing a string against a number, which are only working by luck because the strings are automatically converted to numbers. Its always better to explicitly convert the strings to numbers by using <code>parseInt</code> properly and using its return value.</p>
<p>Another thing: Always use braces with <code>if</code> in order to avoid errors:</p>
<pre><code>if (eggWeight &gt; 69) {
    alert('Jumbo');
} else if (eggWeight &gt; 63 &amp;&amp; eggWeight &lt;= 69) {
   /// etc...
</code></pre>
    </div>

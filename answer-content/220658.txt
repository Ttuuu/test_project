<p>Generating all permutations is computationally expensive.  For substrings of length <em>n</em>, there would be <em>n</em>! permutations.  Note that 9! (which is 362880) likely exceeds the number of words in an English dictionary.  Since you say that the input to your program may be of arbitrary length, checking the letter counts of each word in the dictionary would be a better strategy than generating all possible permutations, since it avoids pathological running times for large inputs.</p>

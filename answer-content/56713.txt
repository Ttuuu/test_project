<ul>
<li>Some parts of your code are extremely repetitive.</li>
<li>I also wonder about reloading the page upon switching units, since you could surely just convert them in-place.</li>
<li>In your first block, what if (somehow) the value in your <code>localStorage</code> is set, but not to <code>"metric"</code> or <code>"imperial"</code>? Your application probably (didn't look too deeply) won't load.</li>
<li>Your unit conversions don't actually work. (Does this qualify for a flag for off-topic?)</li>
<li>You're missing a quote in your <code>meta charset</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/y120/xTAbw/">I wrote a fiddle.</a> You can see <a href="http://fiddle.jshell.net/y120/xTAbw/show/">the full version here</a>. Here's a summary of changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>I made <code>inactive</code> the default styling, instead of a class.</li>
<li>I DRYed up the system selection.</li>
<li>I changed <code>localStorage</code> to use the API instead of direct assignment.</li>
<li>I moved the event handlers into the script to separate them from the structure.</li>
<li>I made temperatures auto-convert when changing units.</li>
<li>I got rid of the <code>&amp;nbsp;</code>s and replaced it with some styling.</li>
</ul>

<p>There may have been some changes that I left out.</p>

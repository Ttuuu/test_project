<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>You only need <code>daysDiff</code> if it is false that <code>currentTime.getYear() != msgDate.getYear()</code>, so I would put everything with <code>daysDiff</code> in a code block in the <code>else</code>.  You should only define variables where you need them.</p>

<p>If it is today, you trigger the <code>else</code> of the first if-clause:</p>

<pre><code>   } else {
        format.append("dd.MM.yyyy");
        Timber.e("Unexpected time diff: %d", daysDiff);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>but I guess this is a mistake.</p>

<p>I have not tried it, but instead of a flag <code>alwaysShowTime</code> it might be cleaner to write two separate methods.  They might share a third method that does some common work.  It looks confusing as it is, and as I wrote above it seems there is a bug too.</p>

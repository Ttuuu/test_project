<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>I would split the if to 3 variables and give each a name : out of image,  isVisited and isOriginalColor or something similar.</p>

<p>I don't know what sr means, I would use row and col. </p>

<p>FloodFill return image  but dfs change the original image, It can confuse the user of the class. </p>
    </div>

<p>Welcome to code review.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now my question is, is this code efficient ? or did I use the "long way".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You used the long way.</p>
<p>The solution you provide is not portable to systems that don't use ASCII. Use '0' to '9' instead.</p>
<p>Rather than iterating through each of the ASCII characters do a range check:</p>
<pre><code>    if (a &gt;= '0' &amp;&amp; a &lt;= '9')
    {
        return a - '0';
    }
</code></pre>
<p>Prefer variable and function names that are longer and more meaningful.</p>
<p>The function <code>scanf()</code> returns a value that is the number of items read, you can use this for error checking input.</p>
<p>A little less vertical spacing would be good. Formatters can also help with keeping consistent code style unlike:</p>
<pre><code>int i=0;
int l = 0;
</code></pre>

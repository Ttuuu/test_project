<p>I don't think it is correct to write to the output parameter <code>result</code> when you return false. Maybe you should return the result or null instead.</p>

<p>Apart from that I would yet make @alexyorke 's solution more compact (assuming <code>Bounds</code> have constructor from min/max) by getting rid of all the intermediate variables:</p>

<pre><code>public static Bounds GetOverlap(this Bounds a, Bounds bounds)
{
    if (!a.Intersects(bounds)) return null;

    return new Bounds(
        new Vector3(
            Math.Max(a.min.x, bounds.min.x),
            0,
            Math.Max(a.min.z, bounds.min.z)
        ),
        new Vector3(
            Math.Min(a.max.x, bounds.max.x),
            0,
            Math.Min(a.max.z, bounds.max.z)
        )
    );
}
</code></pre>

<p>You may still define the shorthand, but I would suggest omitting the output parameter in which case it becomes alias of <code>Intersects</code> anyway, so maybe it is useless:</p>

<pre><code>public static bool Overlaps(this Bounds a, Bounds bounds)
{
    return a.Intersects(bounds);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And btw if you want to speed it up a little bit, you may look into the <code>Intersects</code> function and you are likely to see that some things that you do in the <code>Overlaps</code> function are done there too. Reimplementing <code>Overlaps</code> without calling <code>Intersects</code> may then be faster, but since you haven't provided the <code>Intersects</code> function, I cannot help here.</p>

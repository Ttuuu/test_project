<h3>Review</h3>

<ul>
<li>Since you are building the array yourself, as opposed to you get a source array from a consumer of your method, I don't think you should create a new array, but rather just adapt the source array. This way, you could avoid <code>slice</code> and <code>concat</code> altogether.</li>
<li>The number of <code>rotations</code> is an integer. However, reading the description behind the link tells use it's clamped between <code>1</code> &lt;= <code>rotations</code> &lt;= <code>nd</code>. There is a slight optimization here. If <code>rotations</code> = <code>nd</code> you don't have to do anything, since a rotation is circular. An elegant way to check this is to normalize <code>rotations</code> as <code>rotations = rotations % nd;</code> assuming you have already checked <code>rotations</code> againsts the clamped range. if <code>rotations = 0</code>, don't rotate.</li>
<li>There's another optimization if <code>nd</code> &lt; <code>2</code>, then any rotation is the source itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>One more thing, which nobody seems to have touched on. This is a somewhat stylistic matter, but it's also style that helps convey <em>intent.</em> Remember that programming is 1% for the compiler and 99% for your fellow programmers, including a later-time yourself.</p>

<p>Normally, if you assign a value on declaration, it's because the initial value of the variable is somehow special or important. Maybe it's a reference counter, or a pointer that needs to point someplace special, or whatever. In C++, if you don't explicitly assign a value on declaration, then the initial value of the variable is <em>indeterminate</em>. This <strong>is</strong> important if you do something with the value before any further assignment. So, for example, in a class,</p>

<pre><code>int some_value = 0;
</code></pre>

<p>is <em>potentially</em> very different from:</p>

<pre><code>int some_value;
</code></pre>

<p>if before you make any explicit assignment you perform some operation that reads the value of it, like perhaps:</p>

<pre><code>some_value++;
</code></pre>

<p>More generally, in principle</p>

<pre><code>int x = y;
</code></pre>

<p>should be equally valid and not look any more odd when written on the longer form of:</p>

<pre><code>int x;
x = y;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>In your case,</strong> there is nothing special about the initial value of 0. The initial value of the variable is thrown away before you make any comparison involving the variable, or even more generally, read the value of the variable.</p>

<p>When I read your code, <strong>it looks like the initial value 0 should be somehow special or important.</strong></p>

<p>You wouldn't write, for some values of <code>x</code> and <code>0</code></p>

<pre><code>int x;
x = 0;
cout &lt;&lt; "Give me a number: ";
cin &gt;&gt; x;
</code></pre>

<p>so based on this line of reasoning, there is equally little reason to write:</p>

<pre><code>int x = 0;
cout &lt;&lt; "Give me a number: ";
cin &gt;&gt; x;
</code></pre>

<p>which does exactly the same thing (and which is pretty much what you are doing).</p>

<p>Since the initial value isn't in any way important, I would suggest that you just remove the assignment entirely, keeping only the variable declaration:</p>

<pre><code>int UserNumber;
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>I would also suggest using a different name for that variable. Perhaps <code>UserInput</code> capitalized to your liking? <em>To me,</em> <code>UserNumber</code> sounds more like some sort of ID number for the user, than a number which the user inputs.</p>

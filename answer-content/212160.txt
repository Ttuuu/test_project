<p>Why do you think that your version in "very bad" ?</p>

<p>There are of course some little improvements that you can do. Like declaring <code>List&lt;M&gt;</code> instead of <code>ArrayList&lt;M&gt;</code> as the return type. Also you can pass <code>Class&lt;M&gt; cls</code> instead of an empty instance of your model.</p>

<p>Another think to improve the readability of your code is to split your main method into many little methods. Like one for the mapping of a class. </p>

<p>Many dislike the <code>switch</code> and specially for a long one like that. If you want you can replace it with a <code>Map&lt;String, BiConsumer&lt;Cursor, Field&gt;&gt;</code> that associate a type and a consumer to set the value to a field. It is usually a wrong parctive to silently ignore an edge case. You may consider to throw an exception or at least log something instead of continuing in the <code>default</code> case.</p>

<p>Instead of testing the name of the type, you can compare the types and add the support for the wrapper types.</p>

<p>Finally for the exception. I am not sure that <code>IOException</code> is the best type, you can also use a logger instead of <code>e.printStackTrace()</code> because this one will pollute your output without any means to control it.</p>

<pre><code>if ( Integer.class.equals(type) || Integer.TYPE.equals(type) ) {
  // ...
} else if ( .. ) {
  // ...  
} else {
  throw new UnsupportedTypeException("Type "+type.getName()+" cannot be mapped.");
}
</code></pre>

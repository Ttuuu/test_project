<h2>Nothing wrong with using the HashMap, but…</h2>

<p>… all you actually need to store is the overall change for each year. Not even total births or deaths, just the total change. You can iterate at the end, and (keeping a high water mark) to find the maximum you only need to check when your change for the year is positive.</p>

<h2>Things that <em>might</em> help</h2>

<ul>
<li>Sort by birth, and keep a priority queue of deaths.</li>
<li>Separate the birth and death, sort both lists.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Plenty wrong with the question, though</h2>

<p>(the interviewer’s, not your posting here).</p>

<ul>
<li>Should changes be considered to happen at the start of the year?</li>
<li>The end?</li>
<li>When do you measure?</li>
<li>Is it the average number for the year, or the maximum possible? Do any of the births happen before any of the deaths?</li>
</ul>

<p>.. and so on. The problem is a little under-specified.</p>

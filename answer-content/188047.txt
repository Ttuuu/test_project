<p>You are assigning <code>c = i</code> in both cases, which means you could pull this out and do this once unconditionally. This also will give you an idea of <code>c</code>s purpose and might give you ideas for how to name your variables in a better way. So trying to stay as close to your code as possible but with the suggested changes, your code could look something along the lines:</p>

<pre><code>inputString = 'azcbobobegghakl'

prevChar = ""
currentString = ""
longestString = ""

for char in inputString:
    if prevChar &lt;= char:
        currentString += char
        if len(currentString) &gt; len(longestString):
            longestString = currentString
    else:
        currentString = char
    prevChar = char
print('Longest substring in alphabetical order is: ' + longestString )
</code></pre>

<p>Also I suggest you think about edgecases and treat these cases or at very least you make it clear (at least in a comment) what happens in those cases. As an idea of what I mean: what happens if there are several longest-strings of the same length? Which one should be printed? All? The first? The last? Just any one? What happens if the inputString is empty - your message will look a bit funny. You could output a different message in such a case.</p>

<p>You might think I‘m a bit pedantic, but I seriously recommend to think about your code in this way.</p>

<p>Other than that, I must admit I don‘t know python well enough to give you „the pythonic“ answer - I‘m not even sure if they use camelCase for python - still I hope you get the idea of the type of improvements I‘m recommending. Other than that your code looks ok to me.</p>

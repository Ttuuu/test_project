<p>I'd just like to point out, that the code IMHO has far too many "length optimizations". Just take the first line:</p>

<pre><code>if (!s.length) return +(!t.length);
</code></pre>

<p>I've been a JS developer for over 20 years and I couldn't say off the top of my head what <code>+</code> does to a boolean. It would be much more readable as:</p>

<pre><code>if (s.length === 0) {
  return (t.length === 0) ? 1 : 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also a comment why these are the correct return values would be very helpful.</p>
    </div>

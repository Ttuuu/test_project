<p>In addition to Himanshu's answer.</p>

<p><strong>Move the instantiation of Random to the class level.</strong></p>

<pre><code>    private static void setRandomNumber()
    {
        Random random = new Random();
        int low = 0;
        int high = 100;
        randomNumber = random.nextInt(high - low) + low;
    } 
</code></pre>

<p>You are creating new instance of Random every time you call the method. Move the instantiation to the class level and only call it from the method, otherwise you are creating objects that are used only once.</p>

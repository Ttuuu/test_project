<p>I am surprised nobody has noted that all the conversion to/from int is superfluous.</p>

<p>Although I see that in SO Python answers to the same question always do that, contrary to eg. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9302681/c-how-to-break-apart-a-multi-digit-number-into-separate-variables">C answer</a>. Is it intentional, is converting to str and doing string operations really preferrable to plain old math?</p>

<pre><code>def count_div_digits(number):
    divisor_digits=set()
    number_copy = number
    while (number_copy &gt; 0):
        digit = number_copy % 10
        if digit !=0 and number % digit == 0:
            divisor_digits.add(digit)
        number_copy /= 10
    return divisor_digits
</code></pre>
    </div>

<p>A Class is for persistent state, here some top level functions would work as well with less code bloat.</p>

<hr>

<p>When you write:</p>

<pre><code>number_list = [] 
for number in range(1, end_number+1):
     number_list.append(self.parse_number(number))
return number_list
</code></pre>

<p>You are just mapping parse_number over a range, so just use map (or a generator expression).</p>

<p>I managed to make your script a bit faster. See the comments in the

<p>I have wrapped all your code in a <code>main</code> function. It is good practice
to do so, even for small scripts, but it makes it easy to see if
there's any dependencies on global variables.</p>

<p>The script runs about four times faster. Most of the speedup comes
from replacing your explicit loop with vector functions. So instead of</p>

<pre><code>for i, a in enumerate(A):
    EE = []
    for b in A:
        e = E_ab(a, b, positions, w_beam, k0)
        EE.append(e)
    E.append(EE)
</code></pre>

<p>those lines now read</p>

<pre><code>coeff = np.exp(-Rsq/w_beam**2)
E = np.sum(A_stuff * coeff, axis = (2, 3)) / w_beam**2
answers.append(E)
</code></pre>

<p>To get the data in a format that vector functions can handle I've
added a lot of
<a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.broadcasting.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">broadcasting</a>. It
can be used to compute, for example, the <a href="https://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/10748/cartesian-products-in-numpy">cartesian
product</a>
of arbitrary numpy arrays.</p>

<p>I think someone who understands the math (which I don't) could
optimize your script even more. Some of the calculations seem
redundant to me, but I have no idea how to factor them out.</p>

<p>I strongly feel that you should separate the logic of the graphics and the algorithm of solving the sudoku. The algorithm is just some operation defined on some data structure of your choosing (actually a good way to regard solving sudokus is as extending a colouring of a graph). </p>

<p>I would write this algorithm to act on whatever data structure is most convenient and makes the algorithm as evident as possible. </p>

<p>Then have functions to adapt between the algorithm representation and the board internal representation.</p>

<p>Then have functions which take you from the boards internal representation to the GUI representation.</p>

<p><code>&lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;</code> (like everything in your compiler's <code>bits/</code> subtree) is not a standard header and therefore not portable.  Even if you're willing to sacrifice portability, it's a poor choice, as it will slow compilation down compared to simply including what you use.</p>

<p><code>using namespace std;</code> is poor practice.  It makes your code less clear, and it may even silently change its meaning.</p>

<p>Don't use the preprocessor to name constants.  Use a properly scoped, strongly typed C++ constant:</p>

<pre><code>constexpr std::size_t max = 100000;
</code></pre>

<p>When using input streams, always check that operations succeed before using their results.</p>

<p>Variable names should be more descriptive.  I have no idea what <code>n</code>, <code>q</code>, and <code>k</code> are supposed to be storing.  In fact, these names are so useless that I gave up reading at this point - it's not at all clear what this is supposed to be doing.</p>

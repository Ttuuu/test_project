<p>If you want to get rid of a for-loop just for code clarity, you could use a <code>Stream</code> and the <code>max()</code> function. (Assuming you're using Java 8+). You could also use Streams for the second for-loop.</p>

<p>Note however, it's not logically possible to avoid iterating through the list twice. You have to check every element to get the largest value, and again to set values on every item in the list.</p>

<p>I don't see you using <code>highestQuantity</code>, it's not really necessary since you have a pointer to <code>recordHighestQuantity</code> already.</p>

<p>Note that Python raises a keyError whenever you access a dictionary key that is not defined. The way to avoid that error is to <code>get()</code> the key which will return <code>None</code> if the key was not set.</p>

<p>For the Environment in particular, there's the <code>os.getenv(...)</code> call which does essentially the same, but simpler.</p>

<p>As a result, your try/catch could just be:</p>

<pre><code>verbose = args.verbose or bool(os.getenv('VERBOSE'))
</code></pre>

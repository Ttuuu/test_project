<p>We need to be more defensive in these areas:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>malloc()</code> and family can return a null pointer.</li>
<li><code>scanf()</code> and family can return fewer than requested conversions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, there's no need to cast the result of <code>malloc()</code> - if you've correctly included <code>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</code>, then it returns a <code>void*</code>, which is assignable to any pointer type.</p>

<p>Writing the unnecessary cast makes the code harder to review, because all casts indicate areas that need close attention by the reviewer.</p>

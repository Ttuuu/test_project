<p>As a general rule, if the only thing your getters and setters do is contain a single statement, a return or assignment respectively, there is no need to make the variable private and it should be declared public.</p>

<p>Specifically to your question: <em>Neither</em> of your approaches are considered "best" nor "proper" practice. You should be using an initializer list before the constructor's body:</p>

<p>Note: There is no indication of what order the variables were declared in the class declaration. I've made a guess here, but they are initialized in the order they are declared regardless of what order you put them in the list so if I've got it backwards and <code>fitness</code> is declared first things will silently break at run-time.</p>

<pre><code>Particle::Particle(std::array&lt;double, 30&gt; p, std::array&lt;double, 30&gt; v)
: bestPosition(p)
, position(p)
, velocity(v)
, bestFitness(rastriginEvaluation(p))
, fitness(bestFitness)
{
    /* DO NOTHING */
}
</code></pre>

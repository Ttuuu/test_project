<p>Quick comments:</p>

<ol>
<li>unsigned long =&gt; size_t everywhere ... it's the same, but that's the alias for this job</li>
<li>check for _xDim, _yDim, _xDim &lt; 0 ... underflow is also undefined behvaiour ;-)</li>
<li>implement operator[] for those who are confident about their bounds, or for faster release builds. It's not trivial for multiple dims, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/6969904/1087626">check here</a>. </li>
<li>free data is flawed. You need to look into unique_pointer or shared pointer which will do this stuff for you. </li>
<li>Resize? It is actually required? Can you not auto-resize during at()? unless you want that as a code check during development. </li>
<li>Consider <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page" rel="nofollow noreferrer">a library</a></li>

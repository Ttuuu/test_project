<p><strong>Simplicity</strong></p>

<p>I think that, for an easy task like this, the <strong>first version</strong> is better as it is considerably simpler while accomplishing the same goal.</p>

<p>It can still be improved though:</p>

<p><strong>Cleaner deletion of file extension</strong></p>

<p><code>infile[:-4]</code> is probably used to remove the extension from the file, but it is not obvious, I suggest <code>infile.replace(".txt","")</code>( 
where the extension may be different from <code>txt</code> but you get the idea).</p>

<p><strong>Context managing</strong></p>

<p>It is so easy to forget to close a file, it is better to use <code>with</code> that will close it automatically every time:</p>

<pre><code>with open(outfile, encoding='utf-8-sig', mode='w') as fp:
fp.write('KMC|freq\n')  
for tag, count in cnt.items():  
    fp.write('{}|{}\n'.format(tag, count))  
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Naming</strong></p>

<p><code>cnt</code> is a mysterious name, I have no idea what kind of data it may contain, I suggest coming up with a better name.</p>

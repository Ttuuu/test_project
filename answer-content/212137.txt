<p>First, on your premises.</p>

<ul>
<li>First of all, <strong>no pattern</strong> would prevent PHP from making a connection to MySQL database on every web api call. Because PHP will die between different API calls, along with all its singletons, connections and any other stuff. So all you can prevent is reconnecting the MySQL database on every call to a database connection class.</li>
<li>No, it is frowned upon using singleton pattern to prevent reconnecting the MySQL database on every call to a database connection class. A more accepted approach is Dependency Injection. </li>
<li>Funny enough, due to a typo, this class <strong>would not</strong> prevent reconnecting the mysql. Had you <code>error_reporting</code> set to <code>E_ALL</code>, PHP would have signaled that you are trying to use a non-existent variable <code>$connection</code> every time <code>getInstance()</code> is called. Surely you wanted to call it as <code>$this-&gt;connection</code> instead.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now to the code.   </p>

<p>The intention is very good, especially I like <code>getResult()</code> and <code>execute()</code> methods that allow you to avoid that bind param hassle. However, there is evidently a duplicated code. Why not to make execute to return $statement? It will let you make <code>getResult()</code> as simple as</p>

<pre><code>public function getResult(string $sql, iterable $params) : mysqli_result
{
    return $this-&gt;execute($sql, $params)-&gt;get_result();
}
</code></pre>

<p>And finally. I just noticed, halfway the review process, that your code is off topic, as it simply doesn't work. Mysqli is not PDO, you cannot bind your parameters in a loop. So you need to rework it. In order to help, here are two my articles:</p>

<p>Recursion comes with overheads. You need to push to the call stack and create a new context for your code to execute in.</p>
<p>I would convert this to an iterative solution.</p>
<p>You also don't need to allocate so much memory. Think closely about what information you actually need. HINT: If you could only go long on the stock, you would only need to store 2 ints as you iterate over the list to get your maximum profit.</p>
<p>Furthermore leetcode has the option of viewing code from the fastest solutions. Check that out and if you don't understand why their solution is so much faster, post on stack overflow.</p>

<p>I've two recommendations that probably have more to do with design rather than with code. The first one is to change the API path to <code>players</code>:</p>

<pre><code>@RequestMapping("/players")
</code></pre>

<p>I personally like to pluralize resource path names even if <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6845772/rest-uri-convention-singular-or-plural-name-of-resource-while-creating-it">it's widely discussed</a>.</p>

<p>The other one is to modify your <em>PUT</em> endpoint in order to also accept resources to be created. That way you would have a single endpoint which accepts a list of players, where players might be new or already have an id. For the first case, the system must create them, for the second, update them. That's also a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/630453/put-vs-post-in-rest">mather of disussion</a> in the net.</p>

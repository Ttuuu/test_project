<p>One thing that I don't like is code such as the following whenever you deal with an empty container:</p>

<pre><code>std::cout &lt;&lt; std::endl &lt;&lt; std::endl;
std::cout &lt;&lt; "\t" &lt;&lt; "LL-&gt; Node (" &lt;&lt; location &lt;&lt; ") Not Found In The List.";
std::cout &lt;&lt; std::endl &lt;&lt; std::endl;
</code></pre>

<p>When you move your code into a class, as @πάντα ῥεῖ said, then you should probably <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/throw" rel="nofollow noreferrer">throw</a> an exception (You can make your own class and inherit it from <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/error/exception" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>std::exception</code></a>) instead of <code>cout</code>ing something. Otherwise, your function is given too many responsibilites, and not all applications for a linked list have a console to output to.</p>

<p>The other thing I don't like is this conditional:</p>

<pre><code>if (head == temp1 &amp;&amp; tail == temp1) {
  head = nullptr;
  delete temp1;
} else if (temp1 == head) {
  head = head-&gt;next;
  delete temp1;
} else if (temp1 == tail) {
  temp2-&gt;next = nullptr;
  tail = temp2;
  delete temp1;
} else {
  temp2-&gt;next = temp1-&gt;next;
  delete temp1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how there is a <code>delete temp1</code> at the end of every one of those conditionals. That breaks the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" rel="nofollow noreferrer">D.R.Y</a> principle. Make the <code>delete temp1</code> unconditional.</p>

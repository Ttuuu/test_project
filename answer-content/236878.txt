<p>Some good points have been said, I'm not going over those again. Just wanted to say that your code is probably meant to be used by someone else. Even if it's not, your API should reflect what your code will be working on.
I would not take 2 arrays for input, but an array of 2d coordinates. Then, if for your computation it's easier to split those coordinates in 2 arrays, do this inside your code.</p>

<p>My 2 cents.</p>

<p>There is a very famous quote in software engineering: The only fixed thing in software is change.</p>

<p>So if it doesn't seem to you face any change in the future, that not means that you won't face any change in the future.</p>

<p>But there is something in your code. The instances of your class have no property for themselves. All values are <code>static</code>. This doesn't seem good. If you have a real object in your code that represents a project, so that object should has its own values. </p>

<p>So I think you should remove that <code>static</code> notations from your code and make those properties owned by instance. If it's applicable for you, then inheritance for creating different kinds of <code>Project</code>s are a really good thing to do.</p>

<p>But If you think you should not remove those <code>static</code> values, inheriting is still a good idea. Because you can pass different types of Projects in your code without modifying it.</p>

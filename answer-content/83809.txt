<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>One minor nitpick, really:</p>

<pre><code>// where s = (a + b + c) / 2, or 1/2 of the perimeter of the triangle 
double s = (a + b + c) / 2;
</code></pre>

<p>In the comment you refer to the perimeter of the triangle, but in your code you don't use the actual perimeter. This is very small code duplication. Your code would be a bit more self-documenting if you would do:</p>

<pre><code>double s = perimeter() / 2;
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>I personally have nothing against the a, b, c names in this case. The sides are often named that in Mathematics, I don't think it's horribly wrong to name them that here as well.</p>

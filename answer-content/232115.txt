<p>First of all, it is very good you decided to ask.<br>
Also, it is also very good you are using count(*) to get the count. </p>

<p>For the rest follow the review.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There must be a single table with comments where the comment type is distinguished by means a dedicated field. Which makes your code would be</p>

<pre><code>function countComments($ID, $type){
    $st = $this-&gt;conn-&gt;prepare("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM comments WHERE ID=? and type=?");
    $st-&gt;execute([$ID, $type]);
    return $st-&gt;fetchColumn();
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The code to get <code>$total</code> variable a good example of a cargo cult code.</p>

<ul>
<li>why define $total if it gets assigned the line below? </li>
<li>why loop over a result that contains only one row? </li>
<li>I don't really get why do you need <code>$all</code> variable</li>
<li><p>Finally, <a href="https://phpdelusions.net/pdo#fetchcolumn" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PDO supports different fetch types</a>, there is no point in using fetchAll() in <code>countComments</code>().  So the code should be just</p>

<pre><code>$total = $comments-&gt;countComments($ID, $type);
</code></pre></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>I don't really get what does your counting the number of pages do, but all examples I've seen are doing it in a single move, </p>

<pre><code>$all_pages = ceil($total/$per_page);
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The code in Defining the links is essentially duplicated. Why not to define only different parts and then have a single block of code</p>

<pre><code>$type = isset($_GET['songid']) ? 'song' : 'singer';
$id   = $_GET[$type.'id'];
$base_link = "/comments/$type/$id/";

$next_link      = $base_link.($_GET['page']+1);
$prev_link      = $base_link.($_GET['page']-1);
$next_next_link = $base_link.($_GET['page']+2);
$prev_prev_link = $base_link.($_GET['page']-2);
$last_link      = $base_link.$page;
$first_link     = $base_link."1";
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>That's for starter, hope someone will cover the rest</p>

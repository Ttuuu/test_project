<p>Hellow got most of the good parts, but, I'd also recommend figuring out how you might want to signal the user so that an invalid input isn't accepted, since -1 is a temperature someone might want to convert.</p>

<p>In this case I would do something like replacing</p>

<pre><code>let temp: i32 = match temp.trim().parse() {
    Ok(temp) =&gt; temp,
    Err(_e) =&gt; {
        -1
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>with</p>

<pre><code>let temp= match temp.trim().parse() {
    Err(_e) =&gt;{
        panic!("That wasn't valid input! Temperatures can only be integers!");
    }
    Ok(i)=&gt;i
};
</code></pre>

<p>If I knew this program were to be used solely interactively, then I'd consider adding a loop to give the user another attempt should their input fail.</p>

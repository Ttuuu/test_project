<p>The most time consuming part of the code is sieving prime numbers. And it is  important to realize that each time you sieve, you'd arrive to the same set. In other words, you may compute it once - for the largest <code>n</code> - and reuse the result for all the tests.</p>

<p>There is at most 10 test cases. Read them, find the largest <code>n</code>, sieve the relevant primes, and then loop over the cases.</p>

<p>The sieve code is correct. The results are correct.</p>

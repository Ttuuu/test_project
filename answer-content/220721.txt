<p>Instead of a char array you can use <code>std::aligned_storage</code>.</p>

<p>You aren't consistent with your macros you have both <code>constexpr</code> and <code>_CONSTEXPR17</code>. Pick one and stick to it.</p>

<p><code>destroy_at</code> is standard only from C++17 onward. The equivalent syntax is <code>location-&gt;~_Ty();</code> However it may be worth to put this and the placement new into a helper function to move the ugly syntax elsewhere and clarify the function.</p>

<p>You don't have a move variant of push or a bulk add/remove using iterators.</p>

<p>The debate around recursive vs iterative code is endless. Some say that recursive code is more "compact" and simpler to understand.. In both cases (recursion or iteration) there will be some 'load' on the system when the value of n i.e. fib(n) grows large.Thus fib(5) will be calculated instantly but fib(40) will show up after a slight delay. Of course your data type must also be large enough to hold the result.In C I think unsigned long long int on a 64-bit system is the largest that you can get.Beyond that you might want to try to hold the intermediate results in an array.Then the only constraint will be memory.</p>

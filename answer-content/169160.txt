<p>Couple of things I noticed about your code.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Nothing happens if you enter any of the numbers 3,4,5,6,7,8 due to the else if statement checking for below 2 or above 9 instead of anything other than 2 or 9. To resolve this you should use an else instead of an else if as it will catch anything that is not 2 or 9 which is caught in the if statement.</p></li>
<li><p>You have created a manual infinite loop in your else if, the for loop will keep looping as long as the user enters a number below 2 or above 9 this is dangerous, if the number is not matched then it should reset the user back to a prompt and back to first if statement in theory.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>How does the below catch your fancy?</p>

<pre><code>let value = prompt("Enter Value between 2 or 9");

let loopAndOutput = function(value){
  if(value == 2 || value == 9){
    for(let i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++){
      console.log(`${i} times ${value} is:${value * i}`);
    }
  } else {
    let value = prompt("Enter Value between 2 or 9");
    loopAndOutput(value);
  }
}

loopAndOutput(value);
</code></pre>

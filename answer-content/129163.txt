<p>This may go against the intent of the OP question but I need to take into account what is being trying to get cached.</p>

<p>What you are trying to cache here is just a multiplication.
This is equivalent to two <code>Mov</code> and a arithmetic operation (<code>Mul</code>) in <code>assembly</code>. </p>

<p>Even the processor's from the 90's wouldn't have trouble doing 3 assembly operations and all what you are doing is waste memory, nothing else.</p>

<p>My point is: don't cache the values at all.</p>

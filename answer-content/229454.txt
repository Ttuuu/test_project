<p>We need only 5 maximum elements, for that we don't need to sort whole array. We can use alternative approach</p>

<p><strong>Approach 1</strong>: Use 5 local variables and keep track of minimum element in it.</p>

<p><strong>Approach 2</strong>: Use Min-heap and insert first 5 elements of array in min-heap, then iterate on array from index = 5, if heap-root is smaller than number in array then extract that number from min-heap, and insert new.</p>

<p>I don't see much wrong, but then again, I don't have much C# knowledge. One thing I do spot however, is the following:</p>

<p><code>archiveDefinitions.Count() &gt; 0</code> might be replacable with <code>archiveDefinitions.Any()</code>.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb337697(v=vs.90).aspx?cs-save-lang=1&amp;cs-lang=csharp#code-snippet-2" rel="nofollow">this code snippet in MSDN documentation</a> for usage:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;int&gt; numbers = new List&lt;int&gt; { 1, 2 };
bool hasElements = numbers.Any();

Console.WriteLine("The list {0} empty.",
    hasElements ? "is not" : "is");

// This code produces the following output: 
// 
// The list is not empty. 
</code></pre>

<p>By using the <code>Any()</code> method, you prevent counting ALL the elements. This should increase performance, which is an improvement of the code. I don't know whether use of <code>Any()</code> for such a thing is common in C#, though. If it isn't, you might want to add a comment.</p>

<p>Additionally, in <code>RemoveRootArchiveDefinitions</code>, you name the return variable <code>newEntries</code>. Shouldn't it be <code>removedEntries</code>? If not, shouldn't the method name be changed?</p>

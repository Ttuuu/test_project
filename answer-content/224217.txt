<p>I'm sorry, this is not an answer to your question, but it is a partial review of your code.</p>

<p>It seems you've got a serious problem with choosing your names. They don't actually tell me what the purpose of the methods is, or the content of the variables. </p>

<p>Your method <code>getDocument()</code> can do two things: Return the path or the folder of the document. The name doesn't tell me that. It should be something like <code>getDocumentPathOrFolder()</code>. The argument <code>$documentName</code> doesn't contain a document name. It's a boolean. The only way to find out, what really is contained in this argument, is to read the code in the method. It seems to decide whether a path or folder should be returned. A better name would have been <code>$addNameToFolder</code>. Still not ideal.</p>

<p>To make matters worse you have a method called <code>getPath()</code> which, you've guessed it, doesn't return a path. By now I no idea what is actually returned by this method. </p>

<p>If I'm allowed to completely rewrite your code, with a better structure and better names, it would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Document 
{

    public function getDocumentName()
    {
        return $this-&gt;documentName;
    }

    public function getDocumentFolder()
    {
        return storage_path("app/{$this-&gt;stream-&gt;token}/{$this-&gt;unique_id}/"); 
    }

    public function getDocumentPath()
    { 
        return $this-&gt;getDocumentFolder() . $this-&gt;getDocumentName();
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>I assume that <code>storage_path()</code> is part of Laravel, and cannot be changed. The long argument to <code>storage_path()</code> should probably be split into its seperate parts, especially if you also use it elsewhere, but please, spent some time to choose good names.</p>

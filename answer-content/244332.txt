<p>I have one comment about for loops. According to standard, for loop condition is evaluated on every iteration. In function <code>is_prime</code> expression <code>floor(sqrt((double)x))</code> will be evaluated several times which will cause performance penalty. It is better rewrite this loop. For example:</p>
<pre><code>int condition = floor(sqrt((double)x));
for (int i = 3; i &lt;= condition; i += 2)
{
    if ((x % i) == 0)
    {
        return 0;
    }
}
</code></pre>
    </div>

<p>Well I would not recommend doing an abstraction layer over your logging, and also by setting the Logger thru DI, you are not allowing the GetCurrentClassLogger to work the right way.</p>

<p>This is HUGELY important because that way you can say that this class X should output the log thru email, and this other class Y can output the log to file. All thru just configuration.</p>

<p>Therefore just use the logger in each class and write messages to it. That is the best approach and it should be the only pattern you SHOULD use.</p>

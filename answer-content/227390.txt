<p>Variables don't interpolate inside single quotes.  You need double quotes.</p>

<p>No need to capture the old version that we're throwing away. The <code>/g</code> is redundant since the pattern can never match more than once per line (being anchored to start-of-line).</p>

<p>What happens with <code>Version: 0.9a</code>?  <code>Version:1</code>?  <code>Version:</code>?  Better to take the whole line, possibly excluding comments, and relax the space requirement.  </p>

<pre><code>sed -ri "s/^(Version:\s*)[^#]*/\1$version/" SPECS/*.spec
</code></pre>

<p>It's possible for the description or another section to contain the trigger text, and we probably don't want to change that.  Use sed's <code>start,stop</code> addressing to limit replacement to the top block only, stopping at the first <code>%whatever</code> header:</p>

<pre><code>sed -ri "1,/^\s*%/s/^(Version:\s*)[^#]*/\1$version/" SPECS/*.spec
</code></pre>

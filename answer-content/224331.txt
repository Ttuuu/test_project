<p>There is a lot of code duplication between <code>job_read</code> and <code>job_write</code>, and all the work is being done from a lot of threads inside a big mutex that will only allow one thread ever to actually do something. Servicing all clients from a single thread using <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/select.2.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>select(2)</code></a> would be more efficient.</p>

<p>The most annoying failure mode for this setup is that if one of the clients does not acknowledge data and the write buffer gets full, the writer thread will be stuck while holding the mutex, so all other threads that need to access the global data will get stuck as well.</p>

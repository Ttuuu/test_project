<li>I really don't like this svg code in javascript string. Why don't you put in html instead? It's presentation detail of your <code>X</code> and <code>O</code> has no meaning in your code. Edit: or even separate .svg file</li>
<li>Extract your data from HTML. Your "data" are in html elements and <code>innerHTML</code>. That's just too tight.</li>
<li>Your code is mix of different responsibilities (game itself, UI). Try to make tic tac toe game, which is completely independent of HTML. Good practice is to get it working using developer console. For example by adding function <code>move(x,y)</code>. Then you add another piece of code, that will handle only your game HTML interface - for example <code>move</code> function will be called from event fired by click on element. That way your code doesn't mix too many things at once and is a lot more clear. Make more functions, make them return value, use that value (ex: <code>checkWin</code> should return maybe boolean or maybe player who won or undefined, some other function should update UI based on the result). You can also very simply unit test that kind of code.</li>

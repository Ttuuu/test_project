<p>One thing that you could try is moving the null-check for <code>peek</code> and <code>pop</code> to its own method.
In this way you can eliminate the if/else blocks and reduce indentation which is better for reading. Also the name gives you a quick indication what is going to happen on the error without the need to analyse the whole statement in the if.
For this code it's a very small improvement, but if the code blocks get larger, it's rather significant.</p>

<pre><code>public Object peek() {
    breakIfTopisNull();

    return top.item;
}

public Object pop() {
    Node currentNode = top;

    breakIfTopIsNull()

    Node nextNode = top.next;
    top = null;
    top = nextNode;

    count--;
    return currentNode.item;
}

private void breakIfTopIsNull() {
    if(top == null) 
        throw new NoSuchElementException("Underflow Exception");
}
</code></pre>

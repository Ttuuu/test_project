<p>I don't think it's really readable, as it conveys a lot of logic, which is simply unneeded.</p>

<p>Also you should, according to most of the common Java coding standards, not be placing <code>{</code> on its newline, also there should be no blank space between <code>result</code> and <code>;</code> in <code>return result ;</code></p>

<p>I would suggest following, though it needs Java 8:</p>

<pre><code>public static int min(final int first, final int... others) {
    return IntStream.concat(IntStream.of(first), IntStream.of(others))
        .min()
        .getAsInt();
}
</code></pre>

<p>This way you cover the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>You allow an arbitrary amount of integers to be passed to the method.</li>
<li>You get the <code>min()</code> in a clear way, using Java 8 streams, it checks the minimum somehow.</li>
<li>Because you know you have at least one result, you can safety get the value from the <code>OptionalInt</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>One minor nitpick is that the <code>IntStream.concat(IntStream.of(first), IntStream.of(others))</code> to construct an <code>IntStream</code> is rather ugly.</p>

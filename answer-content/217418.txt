<p>I have a few suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>\n\t\t\t\t</code> is everywhere, move it into a function which takes and returns a string, and prepends whatever string it is given with this format - the benefit of this is that if you change your formatting in the future, you only need to do it in one place.</li>
<li>Getting the user to enter their ID is a common operation, so put this logic all in one place. i.e. 

<pre><code>std::cout &lt;&lt; "\n\t\t\t\t--&gt; Please enter your ID: ";
getInput(id);
account = findAccount(id);
</code></pre>

Should be lopped out into its own function, again for the same reason - if the way you want to do it changes, you only need to do it in one place!</li>
<li>Move the code within each case block into its own function, e.g for <code>case 2</code>, just make a function called <code>checkBalance</code> which does exactly that. Call it from the case block (similar to how you have done for <code>case 1</code>). The comments already hint at what each block does, but the whole of the switch/case statement is quite a lot of code!</li>
<li>The way you look up accounts is a little confusing and potentially inefficient for large numbers of accounts, I would use a map (<a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/map/map/" rel="noreferrer">http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/map/map/</a>) with the key being the ID.</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope this is enough to get you on your way, if you give this another stab then I'm happy to take another look!</p>

<p>A first step could be to add <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/" rel="nofollow">docstrings</a> to your methods: it helps your readers understand the goal of your methods and it help yourself know what those methods should and should not do.</p>

<p>Then you should check the user input: I suppose, that the <code>key</code> variable is a string. You should enforce it and raise a <code>TypeError</code> when it is not the case (for example a list of strings should not be accepted).</p>

<p>I would rename the <code>get_value</code> method to <code>get_hash</code>, to show that it computes a hash between 0 and 255.</p>

<p>You currently store the actual values either directly or in a list. I think you should stick to one data structure: a list, or even better a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=set#set" rel="nofollow"><strong>set</strong></a> (it has <code>add</code> and <code>remove</code> method just as you need).</p>

<p>You could also use the same conventions as the set for your public method naming: <code>add</code>, <code>remove</code> (and I would suggest <code>has</code> instead of <code>lookup</code>).</p>

<p>You could also implement some of the python <a href="http://www.rafekettler.com/magicmethods.html" rel="nofollow">magic methods</a> like <code>__contains__(self, item)</code> and <code>__delitem__(self, key)</code></p>

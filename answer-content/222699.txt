<p>So far what I see is you aren't either casting nor sanitizing your <code>$_POST</code> variables but simply placing them into your SQL statement - it's better you perform some sort of filtering on those arguments (e.g. remove whitespaces, fixing invalid characters like <code>'\'</code> to <code>'\\'</code>, etc.) and ensure you are passing numbers (according to your example you'd maybe use <code>intval()</code>), not a string or <code>NULL</code> value (unless that's intended, which I doubt).</p>

<p>In addition, the server-end should separate the database calls from parsing and filtering content - either as separate functions, files and/or both; if you were going the OOP route, then you'd set up a class(es) for either activity and use a layering system like MVC, N-Tier, MVVC.</p>

<p>All of this goes into making your code more reusable and easier to manage plus adds a layer of security via "Abstraction".</p>

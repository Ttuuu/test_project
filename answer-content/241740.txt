<p>Adding to Maarten Bodewes' answer, checking if a user ID exists by loading all user identifiers from database and checking if the ID exists in the result set is extremely inefficient and as Maarten mentioned, limiting the result set to 100 makes the implementation incorrect.</p>

<p>The correct way for this particular implmentation is to create a method <code>private boolean userIdExists(long userId)</code> and check if the query "<code>SELECT userId from USERS where userId = :id</code>" returns zero or more rows.</p>

<p>And make note, all this user ID generation code needs to be run inside a database transaction to prevent concurrent execution from inserting two identical identifiers.</p>

<p>But still, use an UUID or a database generated numeric identifier that is automatically generated when a row is inserted to the user table.</p>

<p>This problem is related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory" rel="nofollow noreferrer">graph theory</a>, and you're looking for an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulerian_path" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><em>Eulerian cycle</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In graph theory, an Eulerian trail (or Eulerian path) is a trail in a
  finite graph which visits every edge exactly once. Similarly, an
  Eulerian circuit or Eulerian cycle is an Eulerian trail which starts
  and ends on the same vertex.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can find a Eulerian cycle if and only if every airport is connected to an even number of airports. To find the cycle in linear time, you can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulerian_path#Hierholzer's_algorithm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Hierholzer's algorithm</a>.</p>

<p>You could use a graph library for Javascript, e.g. <a href="http://js.cytoscape.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Cytoscape</a>.</p>

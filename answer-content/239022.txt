<p>The code looks OK. You may want to move the query outside of the <code>foreach</code> loop and group the results afterwards. But the <code>foreach</code> loop is limited to the number of days in a month, so I don't think that will do very much. That may cause the application to use more memory.</p>

<p>Therefore, I advise testing if the performance is indeed an issue. If so you might want to delegate creating the export to a queue. Queues in Laravel are not hard to implement (surprise!) </p>

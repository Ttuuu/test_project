<p>It's looking good and it's an interesting project. I'm not familiar with selenium, but since you create a Class for each anime show sharing most of the code, you could implement a parent anime show Class and inherit the methods to each child Class. Or maybe have each anime show as an instance of the same Class, just changing the anime show title or the necessary attributes.</p>
<p>EDIT: You could use the same class for both anime shows as follows. Instead of two classes, you create a new class <code>AnimeShow</code> with the same attributes and methods. You add the parameter <code>anime_show</code> to the <code>__init__</code> function so that you can initialize anime shows with different titles . You would also need to change your code to use the new attribute <code>self.title</code> where necessary.</p>
<pre><code>class AnimeShow():
    
    # Adding anime_show parameter
    def __init__(self, anime_show):
        # Same attributes as you had before
        # ...
        self.title = anime_show

    # Rest of class methods
    # ...

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Creating different anime shows with the same class
    clover = AnimeShow("Black Clover (TV) (Dub)")
    fire = AnimeShow("Enen no Shouboutai: Ni no Shou (Dub)")
    clover.checker()
    fire.checker()

</code></pre>

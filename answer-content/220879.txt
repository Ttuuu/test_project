<p>I rejigged your code a little to make it tidier. I don't have PowerBI, so I haven't tested it, and I can't guarantee that I haven't done anything dumb.</p>

<p>I got rid of the nested loop. Note the <code>-PipelineVariable ws</code>. What that does is put the output of that stage of the pipeline into a variable called <code>$ws</code>, which we can refer to later. It means that we don't need to do <code>$ws = $_</code>.</p>

<p><code>-PipelineVariable</code> is one of the "Common Parameters", and is available on many or most cmdlets. You can abbreviate it to <code>-PV</code>, by the way.</p>

<p>I also got rid of the intermediate array <code>$myArray</code> since it wasn't needed.</p>

<pre><code>Install-Module -Name MicrosoftPowerBIMgmt

    ForEach-Object {
            [pscustomobject]@{
                workspaceId   = $ws.Id
                workspaceName = $ws.Name
                reportId      = $_.id
                reportName    = $_.Name
                reportUrl     = $_.WebUrl

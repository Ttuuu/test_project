<p>You are discarding most of the random bits from the random numbers that you generated.  All you need is a random integer between 0x000000 and 0xffffff, inclusive.</p>

<p>I would use a very similar solution to @holroy's.  Also, I suggest dropping "get" from the function name, since it's generating rather than retrieving something.</p>

<pre><code>function randomColor() {
    var color = Math.floor(0x1000000 * Math.random()).toString(16);
    return '#' + ('000000' + color).slice(-6);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that picking a color uniformly from the RGB color space might not be the best approach, depending on what you are using the color for.  If you want to pick colors that are uniformly distributed according to human color perception, use the <a href="http://tools.medialab.sciences-po.fr/iwanthue/theory.php">L-a-b color space</a> instead, then convert the result to RGB.</p>

<p>This solution is equivalent to the one in the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/42535/641955">accepted answer</a> of the question you linked. The expression you used is the 1D-array equivalent of how that answer derived the appropriate <code>(row, col)</code> indexes in a 2D-array. The time complexity is \$O(N^2)\$, because in an NxN matrix there are \$N^2\$ cells, and your main operation visits all of them. You have some extra costs due to <code>.rstrip()</code> and <code>.replace()</code> but those don't change the asymptotic complexity.</p>

<p>In terms of Python coding,
you forgot to close the file you opened after reading.
You should wrap the loop inside a <code>with open(...) as fh:</code>,
iterate over <code>fh</code>, and it will be automatically closed when leaving the <code>with</code> block.</p>

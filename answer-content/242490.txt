<p>The code does not produce permutations. It produces the subsets of <span class="math-container">\$M * N\$</span>-strong set. Below assumes that <em>it</em> is the goal of the code.</p>

<p>Recursive solution is correct, but may take too much memory (there are exponentially many subsets, namely <span class="math-container">\$2^{N*M}\$</span> of them). I strongly recommend to switch to an iterative approach:</p>

<pre><code>    bool next_subset(int [] subset) {
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; subset.size(); i++) {
            if subset[i] == 1) {
                subset[i] == 0;
            } else {
                subset[i] = 1;
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>which takes the same time, linear memory, and can be used to stream the subsets one-by-one.</p>

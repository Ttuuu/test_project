<p>I wonder why are you getting the <code>Graphics</code> object like this? To redraw something you should actually handle the <code>Paint</code> event or override the <code>OnPaint</code> method where you get a ready to use <code>Graphics</code> object from the system. And of course like <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/151875/using-graphics-to-draw-on-form-in-c#comment286587_151877">@Cody Gray</a> said, you need to dispose a graphics object acquired this way.</p>

<p>Those <code>try/catch</code> blocks are suspicious too. There is nothing that could throw an exception. If this runs every 100ms there is no room for exception handling. This would be very bad for the performance.</p>

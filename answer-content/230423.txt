<p>The answer is the <code>Unit Of Work</code> pattern. You are right that <code>using</code> is modern only it can not be used if you have a <code>Unit Of Work</code> in your repository that has lets say 3 write actions in it that are part of ONE transaction, but can be split in 3 writing methods. For those 3 write actions you will need the same context from the same repository. Most of those times there will be a <code>Commit</code> method in that repository to "Commit" that atomary transaction. You can then also Implement a "Rollback" method if one of those 3 write actions will fail.</p>

<p>You can store your numbers in a list after taking them as input as a string separated by spaces, then splitting them into a list using the list.split() function and finally converting each of them to integers.</p>
<pre><code>input_string = input('Enter the numbers separated by space: ')
list_of_numbers = []
for character in input_string.split():
    list_of_numbers.append(int(character))
nums = len(list_of_numbers)
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, you have your variable nums, and all the numbers you took as input are in the list list_of_numbers. This can also be written in the following way -</p>
<pre><code>list_of_numbers = [int(number) for number in input('Enter all the numbers you want to calculate: ').split()]
nums = len(list_of_numbers)
</code></pre>
    </div>

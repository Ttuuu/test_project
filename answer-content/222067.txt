<p>Everything must be done on the <em>database level</em>.
It is incomparably resource-friendly. Instead of fetching all the data from database and looping over many rows most of which do not even meet the condition, we must set this condition right in the query, to fetch the only rows we need. </p>

<p>Better yet, instead of deleting and updating rows one by one, we must delete and update based on the condition as well.</p>

<p>The logic with information messages is also a bit flawed so I fixed it as well. You cannot tell "All ok, 0 deleted" if <em>only one</em> row is OK.</p>

<p>And as a last stroke, lets make the <a href="https://phpdelusions.net/mysqli/mysqli_connect" rel="nofollow noreferrer">mysqli connection</a> more robust and also put it in a separate file.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
include 'mysqli.php';

$time = time();
$res = $mysqli-&gt;query("SELECT Steam FROM trial WHERE Stop &lt;= $time");
$expired = $res-&gt;fetch_all();

if ($expired) {
    $mysqli-&gt;query("UPDATE trial SET `Expired` = 'True' WHERE Stop &lt;= $time");
    $mysqli-&gt;query("DELETE FROM sm_admins a, trial t 
                  WHERE t.Expired='True' AND a.identity = t.Steam");
    foreach ($expired as $row) {
        echo "Deleted $row[0] From trial Reason: Expired\n"; 
    }
} else { 
    echo "All ok, 0 deleted"; 
}
</code></pre>

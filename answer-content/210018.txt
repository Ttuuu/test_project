<p>One of the big draws of an Observable class are the operators like <code>map</code>, <code>flatMap</code>, and <code>scan</code>. At minimum you should implement those three functions. </p>

<p>That said, chaining your Observables together with map, &amp; al. would be a bit problematic since they all would maintain a copy of the last element emitted (in the <code>value</code> parameter.)</p>

<p>I would rather see the Observable class do away with that parameter so I can chain several together without wasting a bunch of memory.</p>

<ul>
<li>Most importantly algorithm: Since the shortest path from top-left to any point on the grid is dependent on the points above and to the left of that point, <strong>dynamic programming</strong> can be used to calculate the path. It's O(MN) so it should give an answer in reasonable time for 1000*1000 grid. space complexity is O(MN) too. memory consumption will be about 2MB.</li>
<li>Dont do IO in the constructor. </li>

 - Use plain arrays when the size is known. as in this case. use new[] operator. std::vector does bounds checking. arrays are faster.</strike></p>

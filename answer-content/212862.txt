<p>I think a key point that is still missing is the idea of separating logic from data.  The stat values should be stored in some sort of text file so that they can be changed separately from compiling the game.  (Maybe a CSV?)</p>

<p>Consider a point where you have a hundred different enemies.  You don't want to have all 1400 attributes stored in code (14 attributes per enemy).</p>

<p>Expanding on this, you could also offload the "configuration" of each enemy to this same file. (What they are strong/weak against, what they drop, the gold/XP they are worth, their rarity,...)</p>

<p>This is an excellent resource that expounds on this idea a bit further: <a href="http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/bytecode.html" rel="noreferrer">http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/bytecode.html</a></p>

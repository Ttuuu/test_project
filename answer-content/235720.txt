<p><code>Values</code> of the Base class should have <code>protected set;</code>.</p>

<p>In <code>Mesh</code> there is inconsistency with properties. Most are not <code>readonly</code> while some are.</p>

<p>Depending of whether or not those properties should be <code>readonly</code> you may remove <code>Values</code> initialization as well as <code>xn</code> and <code>yn</code> computation from <code>Compute</code>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, regardless of previous points, depending on whether or not <code>Compute</code> is called a lot in your application you might want to have a run context with array as a field so that a closure is not created.
And then you can even turn lambda in <code>Parallel.For</code> into a method pointer to a private method.
What this will allow you to do is allocate memory for 2 less object in <code>Compute</code>, which again based on frequency of usage can give you a performance boost.</p>

<p>Why? Firstly, allocation of memory is a slow operation. Secondly, garbage collection freezes all threads while is works. So less objects to collect - better.</p>

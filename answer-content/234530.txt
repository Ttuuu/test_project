<p>You are almost good. The reason of being slow and allocates a lot is that you create the map for score everytime <code>Score()</code> is called - it is a huge waste. The map never change, and hence only need to be created once at startup.</p>

<p>You can add a global variable <code>var scoreMap = countScore()</code> and re-use the variable in the scope: <code>score += scoreMap[char]</code>.</p>

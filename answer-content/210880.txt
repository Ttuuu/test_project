<h2>Consider using <code>restrict</code></h2>

<p>...on your pointer arguments. If you aren't familiar with this keyword, it requires more explanation than can reasonably go into this answer, so you'll have to do some reading, but - in short, it can help with performance.</p>

<h2>Use a <code>define</code> instead of a variable</h2>

<p>This:</p>

<pre><code>extern const uint16_t default_capacity;
</code></pre>

<p>isn't terrible, but it hinders the compiler's capability to optimize based on known constants. Advanced compilers with "whole program optimization" that have an optimization stage between object compilation and link can figure this out, but older or naively configured compilers won't. Using a <code>#define</code> in your header will fix this.</p>

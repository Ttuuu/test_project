<p>Your algorithm has a flaw - it's too greedy. Take this example:</p>
<pre><code>Foo(6, 2) // "AABBAAAA"
</code></pre>
<p>Alas, it should return "AABAABAA".</p>
<p>In terms of a review, your method shouldn't be called <code>Foo</code> - give it a descriptive name.</p>
<p>Great use of <code>StringBuilder</code>. You could initialize the length to a+b in the constructor as you know what size your finished string will be.</p>
<p>Expression bodied members can greatly improve readability in my opinion:</p>
<pre><code>static char SwapChar(char c) =&gt; 
    c == 'A' ? 'B' : 'A';
</code></pre>
<p>Try to avoid variables like <code>flag</code>. I had to read the whole loop before I knew what that variable meant. I'd call it something like <code>repeatCount</code>.</p>

<p>My computer theory classes have been a couple of decades ago, so I may be wrong, but you seem to be confusing the terms "node", "vertex", "edge" and some more. </p>

<p>Unless I'm mistaken "node" and "vertex" are the same thing, so I'd suggest to use one or the other, but not both. You also seem to sometimes call the value assigned to a vertex "node". Use a consistent term such as "value" instead.</p>

<p>Also nodes (usually) don't have weights, vertices do.</p>

<p>Then the method <code>addNode</code> actually adds an edge, so it should be named accordingly.</p>

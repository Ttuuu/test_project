<li><p>You should avoid the global vector variable and instead pass it by reference into the functions. I would remove all global variables and pass them through functions instead.</p></li>
<li><p>The input is a little weird. You could do it differently using getline. It should not be checking if you type "null." Also what if you just pass in one string, it would blow up I'm pretty sure. Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>string line;

while (getline(std::cin, line))
{
    // line contains entire line user entered
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Keep your for loop format and brackets consistent.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no reason to define different names for vector and string either, just confuses other developers. If you do not want to type std::vector, std::cout everytime you use it, you can declare at the top "using std::cout"</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Other than that it seems pretty straightforward. Good job :D</p>

<p>The main thing that is frowned upon is the global variables, not passing references through functions, and how you are getting user input.</p>

<p>Considering that PHP will always output both named and numeric indexes (also tried with <code>preg_match_all</code>), and considering that the next piece of code expects an array with named indexes only, there's no other way (that I could think of) than to go through all items in the array and unsetting the numeric-indexed items using <code>foreach</code> and <code>unset</code>.</p>

<p>Besides, considering that you're saying that the pattern and subject might be much more complex, the "clean-up" procedure time should be negligible compared to the execution time of <code>preg_match</code>.</p>

<p>If going through all items using <code>foreach</code>, testing and unseting them takes a significant time, I would suggest moving the tests into the code that will use the array, and if <code>!is_int($key)</code> then process the value  according to your requirements.</p>

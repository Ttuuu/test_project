<p>One thing that always comes to <em>my</em> mind when seeing code like that is one of the first principles in programming that everyone learns.</p>

<h2>Don't repeat yourself.</h2>

<p>In your code, the part that stands out is <code>mod year n == 0</code>; let's get away with it first:</p>

<pre><code>isLeapYear :: Int -&gt; Bool
isLeapYear year = divisibleBy 400 || (divisibleBy 4 &amp;&amp; not $ divisibleBy 100)
    where
        divisibleBy x = mod year x
</code></pre>

<p>Using such short helpers is <em>very</em> convenient in Haskell. In my opinion it's one of the most important reasons for the code staying readable (contrary to some newcomers' opinions who just pile up code in one giant expression).</p>

<p>Now, what I don't like here is the full name for the <code>year</code>; I know, I know, it's descriptive, but bear with me:</p>

<pre><code>type Year = Int

isLeapYear :: Year -&gt; Bool
isLeapYear y = divisibleBy 400 || (divisibleBy 4 &amp;&amp; not (divisibleBy 100))
    where
        divisibleBy x = mod y x == 0
</code></pre>

<p>Now, this is the point where I'd really, <em>really</em> leave it be.</p>

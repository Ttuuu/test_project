<p><code>check_a20</code> has two bugs in it.  First, you not comparing with the correct memory addresses.  The physical address for the real mode <code>FFFF:0500</code> address is</p>

<pre><code> FFFF0
  0500
 -----
1004F0
</code></pre>

<p>which, if A20 is off, will wrap around to 0000:04F0, not 0000:0510.  The correct addresses to use are <code>0000:0500</code> and <code>FFFF:0510</code>.</p>

<p>The second error is with how you get the result of the test back to the caller.  You have a comparison instruction, <code>cmpb $0xBE, %es:(%si)</code>, which will set the Z flag (among others).  You have several other instructions (pop, mov, pop, mov) then an <code>xor %ax, %ax</code>, which will set the Z flag.  The <code>je</code> on the next line will then always jump, so your <code>check_a20</code> will always return 0.</p>

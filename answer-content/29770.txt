<p>You could use a different quote style to reduce the number of escaping needed, in this case: single quote <code>'</code> or three quotes <code>'''</code> or <code>"""</code>.</p>

<pre><code>cur.execute('SELECT "b"."Disposals" AS "Disposals", \
                    "a"."ASSET NUMBER" AS "Record", \
[...]
ORDER BY "a"."ASSET NUMBER"',(sqlHunt, sqlHuntBoB))
</code></pre>

<p>If you use three quotes, you do not need to escape that quote character. Also, with three quotes, you can write a multi-line string directly (except the last quote must be escaped, but if we add a space before the three quotes, the escaping is not necessary).</p>

<pre><code>cur.execute("""SELECT "b"."Disposals" AS "Disposals", 
                    "a"."ASSET NUMBER" AS "Record",
[...]
ORDER BY "a"."ASSET NUMBER\"""",(sqlHunt, sqlHuntBoB))
</code></pre>

<p>Beware that this is not equal to the first example: the second example have newlines in the string.</p>

<p>Your expression looks just fine, maybe we would slightly modify that to:</p>
<pre><code>^[+-]?((\d+(\.\d+)?)|(\.\d+))$
</code></pre>
<p>for failing these samples, <code>3.</code>, <code>4.</code>, for instance, just in case maybe such samples might be undesired. Other than that, you have some capturing groups that I'm guessing you'd like to keep those.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Test the capturing groups with <code>re.finditer</code></h3>
<pre><code>import re

regex = r"^[+-]?((\d+(\.\d+)?)|(\.\d+))$"

test_str = ("0.00000\n"
    "0.00\n"
    "-200\n"
    "+200\n"
    "200\n"
    "200.2\n"
    "-200.2\n"
    "+200.2\n"
    ".000\n"
    ".1\n"
    ".2\n"
    "3.\n"
    ".")

matches = re.finditer(regex, test_str, re.MULTILINE)

for matchNum, match in enumerate(matches, start=1):
    
    print ("Match {matchNum} was found at {start}-{end}: {match}".format(matchNum = matchNum, start = match.start(), end = match.end(), match = match.group()))
    
    for groupNum in range(0, len(match.groups())):
        groupNum = groupNum + 1
        
        print ("Group {groupNum} found at {start}-{end}: {group}".format(groupNum = groupNum, start = match.start(groupNum), end = match.end(groupNum), group = match.group(groupNum)))

<h3>Test with <code>re.findall</code></h3>

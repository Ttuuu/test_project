<p>The minheap approach seems correct. The problem is in the <code>answers</code>. It may grow quite large (up to <span class="math-container">\$10^9\$</span>). All the reallocations due to its growth are very costly.</p>

<p>However you don't need it at all. You only care about the time of the most recent alarm. Just one value:</p>

<pre><code>    while k:
        v = heapq.heappop(times)
        heapq.heappush(times, v + x)

        if last_alarm != v:
            last_alarm = v
            k -= 1
</code></pre>

<p>That said, an idiomatic way to access the last element of the list is <code>answers[-1]</code>.</p>

<p>Using <code>ContainsKey()</code> together with the getter of the Item property of a <code>Dictionary&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;</code> should be replaced by a call to <code>TryGetValue()</code> which is faster because the check if the key exists is done by the Item getter too.  </p>

<p>Internally these three methods are calling the <a href="http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/collections/generic/dictionary.cs,bcd13bb775d408f1" rel="nofollow"><code>FindEntry()</code></a> method to check whether a given key exists. So calling this method only once through the <code>TryGetValue()</code> method should be the way to go for instance like so  </p>

<pre><code>public static void Send&lt;T&gt;(object key, T arguments)
{

    var fullKey = new ChannelKey(key, typeof(T));
    object value;
    if (!Listeners.TryGetValue(fullKey, out value))
    {
        return;
    }

    var actionList = (List&lt;MessageReaction&lt;T&gt;&gt;)value;
    foreach (var listener in actionList)
    {
        listener.Reaction(arguments);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Like you can see I have added braces for the <code>if</code> statement as well. Although they might be optional you should add them always to make your code less error prone.  </p>

<hr>

<p>If you are bothered by duplicated code due to the usage of the generic/non generic version you should maybe think about removing the non generic version. Without seeing the calling code and all the possibilities how the non generic version and the generic version is used its hard to tell if removing the code duplication is possible.</p>

<hr>

<p>In general your code looks good. You are using well named methods (except for <code>Reaction</code> IMO) and the documentation makes it easy to understand what the code is doing.  </p>

<p>I wouldn't have the <code>Listeners</code> as a <code>private</code> property but that's a matter of taste. I personally would prefer just a <code>private static readonly</code> field.  </p>

<p>I don't quite see why the <code>MessageReaction</code> should know to which <code>Subscriber</code> it belongs. If the <code>MessageReaction</code> would want to talk to its "parent"  it should use events so there is no need to couple this objects that much.  </p>

<p>A few minor things after a quick look.</p>

<p><em>Inconsistent use of spacing</em>.  The placement of the opening <code>{</code> is sometimes on the same line as the statement it belongs with, other times it is on a line by itself (which makes an almost blank-line gap in the code).  Pick one style and stick with it.</p>

<p>What is <code>glfwCB</code>?  That just seems like a bunch of random characters thrown together for a function name.  Pick something more meaningful, even if it came directly from the tutorial.</p>

<p><em>Inconsistent passing arrays to <code>glShaderSource</code></em>.  For the 'length' array you pass in a one element array, while for the array of strings you pass in the address of a variable as a one element array.  Both ways are valid, but the inconsistency makes it harder to understand what exactly is going on there.  Think about what you'll have to do when you alter this later to use two (or more) shaders.</p>

<p><em>Run on variable declarations</em>.  With <code>vertexShaderID</code> and <code>fragmentShaderID</code>, using two statements and repeating the type makes the code easier to read.  As it is you need to look carefully to see if it is two declarations or one declaration that spans two lines (see, for example, the <code>while</code> near the end of <code>main</code>, which has a very similar appearance but is one statement).</p>

<p><code>g_vertex_buffer_data</code> can be made <code>static</code>.</p>

<p>First of all, the variables aren't named properly. <code>rl</code> and <code>s</code> aren't intuitive at all. Don't hesitate to write longer variable names, it will be very helpful if you ever want to understand your code easily in the future. Same goes for your method name, <code>withoutString</code> isn't clear enough. Your method removes all occurence of a <code>String</code>  in another <code>String</code>. So you might want to consider <code>removeAllOccurences</code> or something like that as a method name. </p>

<p>Next, as @200_success pointed out, your code has flaws. Whenever you see that you wrote 2 (or more in this case) loops with the almost same code, you should wonder if there's another way you could do it.</p>

<p>I'm not sure my method is the most efficient, but I think it can lead you to a good path.</p>

<pre><code>private static String removeAllOccurences(String base, String remove){

    StringBuilder baseLowered = new StringBuilder(base.toLowerCase());
    String removeLowered = remove.toLowerCase();
    StringBuilder baseToModify = new StringBuilder(base);

    int removeLength = remove.length();
    int removeIndex = baseLowered.indexOf(removeLowered);

    while(removeIndex != -1){
        baseToModify = baseToModify.delete(removeIndex,removeIndex + removeLength);
        baseLowered = baseLowered.delete(removeIndex,removeIndex + removeLength);
        removeIndex = baseLowered.indexOf(removeLowered);
    }

    return baseToModify.toString();
}
</code></pre>

<p>I use <code>baseLowered</code> and <code>removeLowered</code> in order to find the indexes of the <code>remove</code> but I keep another <code>StringBuilder</code> named <code>baseToModify</code> to remove the words. The index to remove will be the same wether the <code>base</code> is lowered or not. You also need to remove from <code>baseLowered</code> in order not to find the same index again and again.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if I'm clear in my explanations, it's been awhile since I reviewed something ;) If you don't understand something, don't hesitate to comment and I will answer as fast as I can.</p>

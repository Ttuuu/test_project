<p>The other answer already mentions the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle" rel="noreferrer">Fisher-Yates Shuffle</a> which is definitely what you want to use. I thought I'd break down your Shuffle a bit to show you why it's flawed.</p>

<p>This is what I consider to be one of the best web pages on the entire internet, and it has a section on shuffling that you might find interesting: <a href="https://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/#shuffling" rel="noreferrer">Visualizing Algorithms by Mike Bostock</a></p>

<p>Mike has also created this resource: <a href="https://bost.ocks.org/mike/shuffle/compare.html" rel="noreferrer">Will it shuffle?</a> Go to this page and change the selection to "naïve swap (i ↦ random)" which is what you've implemented. It will show you that the shuffle is quite biased:</p>

<p>If that weren't bad enough, you have accidentally added an additional bias. I've translated your algorithm to JS and run it for you:</p>

<p>Do you see that very dark purple square at the bottom right? That shows a very negative bias for the last element. Let's look at why:</p>

<pre><code>public void Shuffle() 
{
    Card holder = new Card();
    int random;

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 52; i++)
    {
        random = rand.Next(0, 51); // !!!
        holder = CurrentlyInDeck[i];
        CurrentlyInDeck[i] = CurrentlyInDeck[random];
        CurrentlyInDeck[random] = holder;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The documentation for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.random.next?view=netframework-4.7.2#System_Random_Next_System_Int32_System_Int32_" rel="noreferrer">Random.Next</a> says (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A 32-bit signed integer greater than or equal to minValue and <strong>less than</strong> maxValue; that is, the range of return values includes minValue but not maxValue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That means you are only generating a random number between 0 and 50 inclusive. That means you can never end up with the last item in its original place as it is only swapped on the very last iteration of the loop. That's very bad for a Shuffle.</p>

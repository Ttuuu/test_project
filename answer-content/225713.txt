<p>I won't comment on the code itself, since I am not a Python person, but in terms of your <em>approach</em>, I will say this:</p>

<p>Using estimated table position seems like a poor predictor of performance, since it is has very low precision. It also does not allow for groupings of teams at a similar level. </p>

<p>Take for example last season's top 3:</p>

<pre><code>man_city = Team("Manchester City", 20)
liverpool = Team("Liverpool", 19)
tottenham = Team("Tottenham Hotspur", 18)
</code></pre>

<p>Was the difference in quality between Man City and Liverpool somewhat similar to the difference in quality between Liverpool and Spurs? The points tally would suggest that it was not even close - Liverpool got ~34% more points than Spurs, while City only clinched the title by a single point.</p>

<p>Similarly, six of last year's mid-table teams were separated by only 7 points.</p>

<pre><code>52  Leicester
52  West Ham
50  Watford
49  Crystal Palace
45  Newcastle
45  Bournemouth
</code></pre>

<p>Under your system, Leicester would be 5 "skill points" higher than Bournemouth - a seemingly huge gulf in class - while in reality the table would suggest that they're both at a similar level. Without a late equalizer in <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43178521" rel="noreferrer">this game</a>, these two would have even closer. When one goal has the potential to throw off your whole prediction, you know something's up. </p>

<p>I suspect that a much better predictor would be the points tally obtained in the previous season. Of course, for the 3 promoted teams you will not have this information. For these, you could look at the historic difference between a previous season's Championship points tally against their Premier League performance the following season. If there's a correlation then you could use this to estimate a points tally.</p>

<p>You could then start to factor in other factors such as net spend over the summer, number of arrivals and departures, etc. This may start to account for the fact that a team like Chelsea did well last season but have lost an expensive key player.</p>

<p>You could of course start to go much deeper and start to analyse previous results individually and use that to predict the outcome of each game more accurately. Maybe Arsenal do well at home and poorly away, or Burnley get better results against stronger opposition, or a derby game generally has fewer goals than a normal one.</p>

<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>The only thing I can spot here is in this line</p>

<pre><code> public class Lockable&lt;T&gt; where T : new()
</code></pre>

<p>The constraint is probably not bulletproof. What would happen if I did something like</p>

<pre><code> var foo = Lockable&lt;Lockable&lt;Foo&gt;&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>I would imagine this would make for an exciting explosion.</p>
    </div>

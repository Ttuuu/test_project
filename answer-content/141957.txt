<p>The only thing I can see is that you don't need to have the <code>return</code> on a separate line.  <code>return next((c for c in text if c.isalpha()), "")</code> works fine.  It works on both python 2 and python 3 from what I can see.</p>

<p>Also, you could use <code>filter</code> in this situation: <code>return next(iter(filter(unicode.isalpha, text)), "")</code>, although I am not sure that is any real improvement.  On python 3 this approach is a bit simpler: <code>return next(filter(str.isalpha, text), "")</code></p>

<p>You've got a solid start here, but consider a real world problem (and the common follow up question to Fizz Buzz):</p>

<p>The customer now wants your program to also print "Bang" when the number is a multiple of 7.</p>

<p>So, with your current process, you'd need a couple more <code>if</code> statements (for 7, 21 and 35). Not too hard to do, and you can just copy the code you already have for the most part, so this is doable.</p>

<p>But then a few years go by and the company gets bigger. Now, when the number is a multiple of 11, you need to print "Boom".</p>

<p>So are you going to write out a chain of 24 <code>if</code> statements? What if you mess up a number somewhere? Or put the <code>if</code> conditions in the wrong order, like having the check for 15 before the check for 165? You have an unmanageable mess.</p>

<p>The correct solution is to use a list, pairing each number requirement to its word, and build the "FizzBuzzBangBoom" string as you iterate over the list. The method to add a "word" to the string operates the same no matter what the number input is - it's just a modulo function - so you can cut down on a lot of repetition.</p>

<p>As a challenge, try to repeat your project with less repetition (the DRY principle) and SPECIFICALLY do not have the numbers 3, 5, 7 or 11, or any multiples of them, appear in your code more than once.</p>

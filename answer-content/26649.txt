<p><code>both Iterate a list and also check some condition/s</code> and then return true if the condition is met for any element in the collection, otherwise they return false.</p>

<p>It's exactly what you describe, lets write the code:</p>

<p>We have a list or collection to make it more generic. <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Then we have some conditions checked against T elements.
You can define an interface for a condition.</p>

<pre><code>interface Condition&lt;T&gt; {
    boolean check (t t);
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can create a new condition for whatever you want to check.</p>

<p>Now all you need is a method that iterates a collection of Ts and checks them all against a condition. Put that in a utility class and you're done&gt;</p>

<pre><code>static boolean checkAgainstCondition(Collection&lt;T&gt; collection, Condition&lt;T&gt; condition) {
    for (T t: collection) {
        if (condition.check(t) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly you can have utility methods like:</p>

<pre><code>static int countMatches(Collection&lt;T&gt; collection, Condition&lt;T&gt; condition) {
    //count how many elements meet the condition.
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>static boolean moreMatchesThan(Collection&lt;T&gt; collection, Condition&lt;T&gt; condition, count) {
    //return true if there are more than count elements in the collection that meet the condition.
</code></pre>

<p>You can do the same trick also in similar cases for example when you want to select an element from the collection that matches the condition, or if you want to remove from the collection elements that match to a condition etc. It's just the condition interface + utility class.</p>

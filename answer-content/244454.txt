<p>In regards to readability, I agree that there is room for improvement. It seems like you're trying to cram as much code in as you can in fewer lines.</p>
<p>Use the conventional style for Javascript class methods where you have `</p>
<pre><code>name_of_method(arg1, arg2) {
    return ... 
}
</code></pre>
<p>instead of setting them like you are now, like you would a local variable. Additionally, include a line of whitespace between each method definition.</p>
<p>Yes, you will have to write more this way because you're putting a <code>return</code> statement and curly braces for each method now, but this will make your code much cleaner.</p>
<hr>
<p>I like this idea you have going here, but I think you should take better advantage of the design that React tries to push. You've got several elements that are very similar: they display some sort of data, and when they are clicked, they become editable. There are about 5 instances of that here. Why not make a React component that does just that?</p>
<p>Create a new react component that has all that functionality built in, but just for a single element. Then, in this <code>My Profile</code> element, you could set it up something like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;Editable name="first_name"/&gt;
&lt;Editable name="last_name"/&gt;
...
</code></pre>
<p>(note: you don't have to use the name attribute; I'm just using it for the sake of example)</p>
<p>This approach would be much more idiomatic for React and would take better advantage of what the library has to offer.</p>

<p>First of all, microbenchmarks like these don't really tell the whole story. It may only be "fast" or "slow" in this case. In real-world scenarios, it may tell another story (like when you have to deal with stuff other than just arrays).</p>

<p>Another thing is, with such small numbers in the IE tests... you can't really say it's fast :D</p>

<p>Another thing is (and most likely this would be the cause of the great divide in Chrome) is that modern JS compilers tend to optimize "hot code". Other forms of code are internally faster as well due to the browser's implementation of operations.</p>

<p>So in this case, case 2 and case 4 in Chrome might have been optimized internally, whereas case 3 might have been faster for IE7.</p>

<p>I would modify your second version as follows:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdexcept&gt;
bool IsLeapYear(int year)
{
    if ( year &lt; 1583 ) {
    throw std::invalid_argument( "Year predates inception of Gregorian calendar" );
}
    if (year % 4 != 0)
    {
        return false;
    }

    if (year % 4 == 0 &amp;&amp; year % 100 == 0 &amp;&amp; year % 400 != 0)
    {
        return false;
    }

    return true;    
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>The modification</strong> throws an invalid_argument exception if the year is &lt; 1583. The algorithm in the original post only works for the Gregorian calendar, and that calendar was first used in 1582. One should be careful, however, since some countries switched from Julian to Gregorian calendars much later (Greece didn't switch until 1923).</p>

<p>Although the rules for the Gregorian calendars could be projected to years before the Gregorian calendar was adopted, historians usually don't; they usually use the calendar that was in force at the time and place they are writing about, if the calendar was Roman, Julian, or Gregorian.</p>

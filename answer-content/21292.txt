<p>Using classes/ids like <code>column_left</code> isn't a very semantic approach; HTML structure doesn't have any concept of "positioning" and, assuming you care about HTML readers other than a desktop browser (like screen readers or <a href="http://trends.e-strategyblog.com/2013/01/10/percentage-web-traffic-mobile-devices/7164" rel="nofollow">mobile devices</a>), the idea of "left" just doesn't apply.</p>

<p>Instead, try describing <strong>what</strong> the content is. Instead of <code>class="column_left"</code>, you could use <code>id="sub-content"</code> or <code>id="related"</code>. Just choose something that describes the "what" without referring to appearance or positioning.</p>

<p>In regards to your use of <code>article</code> elements, the <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/sections.html#the-article-element" rel="nofollow">HTML5 spec</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <code>article</code> element represents a complete, or <strong>self-contained</strong>,
  composition in a document, page, application, or site and that is, in
  principle, <strong>independently distributable or reusable</strong>, e.g. in
  syndication. This could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper
  article, a blog entry, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget
  or gadget, or any other independent item of content.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Key emphasis added to illustrate that <code>article</code> is meant to be used to say "this is some <em>real</em> content", distinguishing it from containers and markup added to "frame" the content (like sidebars).</p>

<p>Also, your use of <code>section</code> elements is not in-keeping with the specification. The <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/sections.html#the-article-element" rel="nofollow">HTML5 specification</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <code>section</code> element represents a generic section of a document or
  application. A section, in this context, is a thematic grouping of
  content, typically with a heading.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It specifically warns:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <code>section</code> element is not a generic container element. When an
  element is needed for styling purposes or as a convenience for
  scripting, authors are encouraged to use the <code>div</code> element instead. A
  general rule is that the section element is appropriate only if the
  element’s contents would be listed explicitly in the document’s
  outline.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, the idea of a "main" section probably isn't right. Sections are meant to be ways partition a large article into headed-sections, in very much the way a Wikipedia article is laid out. You could easily say you have a "main" article, but a "main" section doesn't make as much sense, and you'd be better off replacing yours with simple <code>div</code> elements.</p>

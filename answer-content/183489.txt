<p>The problem with the above code is for 12:00:00 AM and 12:00:00 PM it gives the answers as 12:00:00 and 24:00:00 respectively as it checks whether it is AM and returns the time as it is without "AM" and adds 12 in hour part if not.But the code below checks whether the hour is 12(AM or PM) and gives the answer accordingly.</p>

<p>Eg:"12:ab:cd AM" is converted to "00:ab:cd" and "12:ab:cd PM" is converted to "12:ab:cd".</p>

<p>The rest is same as the above code.</p>

<pre><code>def convert_to_24(time):
    if time[-2:] == "AM" and time[:2] == "12":
        return "00"+time[2:-2]
    elif time[-2:] == "AM":
        return time[:-2]
    elif time[-2:] == "PM" and time[:2] == "12":
        return time[:-2]
    else:
        return str(int(time[:2]) + 12) + time[2:8]
</code></pre>

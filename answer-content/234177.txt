<p><strong>Design improvements</strong></p>

<p>Even with the Builder pattern, the target class shall only provide constructors that allow creation of valid objects. You still need two different constructors: one for constructing the connector with an access key and one for OTP.</p>

<p>The Builder's responsibility is to provide setters and to check at build time that both access key and OTP are not set at the same time and then call the correct constructor. It should never pass itself to the target class. Just the parameters.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID" rel="nofollow noreferrer">SOLID</a></strong></p>

<p>Your Connector does a lot of things. Instead of having one concrete Connector class for both access key and OTP, you should implement the <code>Connector</code> as an interface or abstract class and have the builder create an <code>AccessKeyConnector</code> or <code>OtpConnector</code> depending on the parameters that were provided to it.</p>

<p><strong>Style</strong></p>

<p>The <code>setMandatoryParameters</code> is a bad name for a method. It should communicate what the parameter does, not if it is mandatory or not. Use <code>setAppUri</code> instead.</p>

<p>I would suggest creating a method for text so you don't have <code>System.out.println</code> every time, but instead have something like <code>text("Text here...");</code> or something similar.
This is done with the following:</p>

<pre><code>public static void text(String text) {
    System.out.println(text);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And to call the method, you type <code>text("Text here");</code>, like mentioned above.
This may make the file size a little smaller and make it much faster to type a text output.</p>

<p>Just more than two terms?  How about many terms and operands?  You're doing it the hard way, and as you're seeing, it's not easily extensible.  You need a different approach.</p>

<p>If you want to evaluate functions of arbitrary complexity, I would suggest the ANTLR4 framework for your expression evaluator.  Java is the "native language" of ANTLR4, and by using the Visitor pattern and a simple expression grammar, you can achieve a lot of capability with far less code than you show here.  </p>

<p>As an example, see Bart Kiers's <a href="https://github.com/bkiers/Mu" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Mu project</a> on github on how to do some very powerful things with little code in ANTLR4.</p>

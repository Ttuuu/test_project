<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p><strong>Suggestion for physical layout of members</strong></p>

<p>A user of the class is most interested in the <code>public</code> section of the class. They are least interested in the <code>private</code> section of the class. Ideally, we would like to hide the <code>private</code> section of a <code>class</code>.</p>

<p>Hence, it makes sense to me to move the <code>public</code> section of the class to the top of the class and move the <code>private</code> section of the class to the bottom.</p>

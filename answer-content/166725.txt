<p>As the exercise doesn't require result to be stored, each digit can be displayed immediately.</p>

<pre><code>    mov     ecx, eax      ; Copy dword to be displayed in reverse
@@: mov      al, cl       ; Move low nibble to AL
    and      al, 1        ; Isolate least significant bit
    or       al, '0'      ; Going to be either 0 or 1

   .....  Whatever is required here to display contents of AL

    shr     ecx, 1
    jnz     @b
</code></pre>

<p>The only difference with this algorithm is trailing zero's won't be displayed. Just a personal preference of mine, otherwise you could substitute ECX to be a counter of 32 and EDX the copy of EAX if the full 32 bits needs to be shown.</p>

<p>I think it's more suitable to use <code>filter</code> than <code>map</code> in this example, because we are basically filtering two arrays. Finally, we just merge them:</p>

<pre><code>filtered1 = arr1.filter(el =&gt; !arr2.includes(el))
filtered2 = arr2.filter(el =&gt; !arr1.includes(el))
merged = [...filtered1, filtered2]
</code></pre>

<p>The function could be a one-liner, although maybe not so readable:</p>

<pre><code>function diffArray(arr1, arr2) {
  return [...arr1.filter(el =&gt; !arr2.includes(el)), ...arr2.filter(el =&gt; !arr1.includes(el))]
}
</code></pre>
    </div>

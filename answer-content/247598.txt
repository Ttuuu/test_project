<p>The other reviewers have already explained how you should re-organize your classes, but I want to expand a bit on how you create them and how it can save you a lot of typing.</p>
<p>So we assume that you use the classes created by akozi.
Then we can put the creation of these classes inside a <a href="https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/list-comprehensions-in-python" rel="noreferrer">list comprehension</a>.</p>
<pre><code>nr_games=10
games=[GAME(GAMEID[i]) for i in range(nr_games)]
</code></pre>
<p>The notation might be new, but the result is just that you have a list containing your 10 games. If you don't like list comprehensions, then you can always replace them with for loops.</p>
<p>This is much easier to manage and manipulate. As a result your following steps become much easier as well.</p>
<pre><code>killsAvg= sum( game.kills for game in games ) / nr_games
assistsAvg= sum( game.assists for game in games ) / nr_games
...
</code></pre>
<p>It might seem like this mainly saves you a lot of typing, but it has some other advantages. It is for example a lot easier to adjust and maintain, for example when changing the nr_games or when adding a new score type.
Additionally, imagine that there is a typo somewhere in the code, then which version would you prefer to check?</p>
<hr>
<p>Generally speaking, whenever you find that you have to do a lot of repeated typing/copy-pasting, stop for a moment and think whether there is a cleaner way to do things.
Often times a lot of the typing can be solved by using data structures such as  lists and dictionaries.</p>

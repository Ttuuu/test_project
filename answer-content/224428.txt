<p>You wrote several <code>for</code> loops without any spaces.
Please don't do that, as it makes the code harder to read.</p>

<p>Instead of</p>

<pre><code>  for(;*colors;colors++) {
    blink(*colors);
  }
</code></pre>

<p>you might prefer</p>

<pre><code>  while (*colors) {
    blink(*colors++);
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Moving <code>loop()</code> to the bottom of the file would save you
some forward declarations.</p>

<p>Your <code>Serial.print()</code> statements might benefit from the addition
of a <code>debug</code> flag, so there's no need to comment them.</p>

<p>Things like counts and durations won't go negative.
I can't see the signatures for <code>delay()</code> and <code>digitalWrite()</code>,
but it seems like some of your <code>int</code>s might want to be <code>uint</code>.</p>

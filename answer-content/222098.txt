<p>You could declare a global variable, and then increment on it, but that clutters the module namespace. So the idiomatic workaround to avoid declaring a global variable is to point to a mutable object that contains the integer on which you wish to increment so that you're not attempting to reassign the variable name -</p>

<pre><code>def valid_boards(board, row, num):
    #rest of the code
    counter[0] += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    counter = [0]
    num = 5
    board = initialise_board(num)
    valid_boards(board, row = 0, num = num)
    print(counter[0], "solutions")
    print("Finished")
</code></pre>

<p><strong>OR</strong></p>

<p>Use an attribute on the function. Set a counter attribute on your function manually after creating it -</p>

<pre><code>def valid_boards(board, row, num):
    #rest of the code
    valid_boards.counter += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    valid_boards.counter = 0
    num = 5
    board = initialise_board(num)
    valid_boards(board, row = 0, num = num)
    print(valid_boards.counter, "solutions")
    print("Finished")
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

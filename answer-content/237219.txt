<p>To answer your specific question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To go with all unique pointers or should we use shared pointers in this case?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You're absolutely correct to return <code>std::unique_ptr</code> values.  This indicates that ownership of the pointed-to object is transferred to the caller.  If you were to return <code>std::shared_ptr</code>, then that would imply that the factory retained a share of the ownership (e.g. by retaining an object pool, or something).</p>

<p>Remember that once the caller has a unique pointer, it is able to convert it to a shared pointer if it needs to (but the opposite conversion is obviously not possible, except via the raw pointer).</p>

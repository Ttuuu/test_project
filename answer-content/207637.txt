<p>I see you have <code>using</code> declarations to bring names from the <code>std</code> namespace into your program.  However, you appear to have missed <code>std::size_t</code>, which you seem to assume is in the global namespace (it might be, with your compiler, but that's a non-portable assumption).</p>

<p>I didn't completely follow the logic of the implementation.  Every time I tried to read it, I just wondered why you're not using <code>std::next_permutation()</code> from the <code>&lt;algorithm&gt;</code> library.</p>

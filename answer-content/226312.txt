<p>In memmove you have the following:</p>

<pre><code>        cmp %rdi, %rsi
        jge 0f
</code></pre>

<p>(<code>cmp rsi, rdi</code> in Intel syntax I believe.) For rsi = 8000_0000_0000_0000h and rdi = 7FFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFFh (we want to jump to make a forward move here) the signed-comparison conditional branch "jump if greater or equal" evaluates rsi as being "less than" rdi (rsi being a negative number in 64-bit two's complement while rdi is positive), so it doesn't jump and will make a backwards move. This is incorrect. You should use the equivalent unsigned branch "jump if above or equal", <code>jae</code> instead.</p>

<p>First doesn't seem like any of this code is used.  I mean it gets called but nothing with the responses is used in the code following the calls.</p>

<pre><code>var abtDAL = new AboutDAL();
var orDetails = new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;
    {
      { "orgId",SISConst.LoggedInUser.LogInOrganizationID},
    };
var response = await SisApi.Get("Homework/GetOrganizationName", orDetails);
var jres = JArray.Parse(response);
var orgName = jres[0]["Title"].Value&lt;string&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>Async void methods are a code smell, it's not recommended.</p>

<p>Also on myPushDataFilterd you don't need to do ToList you can just leave them as IEnumerable.  You won't need the var myPushDataFilterd2.  </p>

<p>You have what seems like a bug in your task code.  You check for myPushData.Any() but are looping around the filtered pushdata. Also</p>

<pre><code>var row = myPushData[index];
</code></pre>

<p>would be wrong because again looping around the filtered data.  I assume you want the myPushDataFilterd2[index].</p>

<p>Also more bugs you are checking string.IsNullOrEmpty(sectionId) to fill myPushDataFilterd2.  If there is no sectionId passed in then myPushDataFilterd2 will be empty and your loop will just exit.  I assume that is not what you want. </p>

<p>HttpClient should be created once and then used for the entire loop and not created each time.  </p>

<p>I would move the entire task code into it's own method passing in parameters and making it async. I don't see the need to create a Task object and start it. </p>

<p>Also move the check for Any and IsSuccessful out of the task.  Why create an object that will not do anything? </p>

<p>UPDATE based on comment</p>

<pre><code>var pushTask = new Task(() =&gt;
{
    if (isSuccess &amp;&amp; myPushDataFilterd2.Any())
</code></pre>

<p>should be changed to this <em>if you leaving it to create a task object</em></p>

<pre><code>if (isSuccess &amp;&amp; myPushDataFilterd2.Any())
{
    var pushTask = new Task(() =&gt;
    {
</code></pre>

<p>As there is no processing done in the task if either of those are false.</p>

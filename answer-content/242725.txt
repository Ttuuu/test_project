<p>You're repeating <em>a lot</em> of code in this program. It seems like as the length of <code>acts</code> gets larger, you expand to analyzing acts. This is a perfect opportunity for a loop. What I did was get the length of <code>acts</code> at the very beginning, then base my loop of that. Since you always want the last element you find, this works great. I'll explain below what I did in places that seem confusing.</p>

<pre><code>from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as bs

site_file = open('samplePage.html')
soup = bs(site_file, 'html.parser')

acts = soup.select('#act_table td:nth-of-type(1)')
sections = soup.select('#act_table td:nth-of-type(2)')
dictionary = {}

ipc = 'indian penal code'
poa = 'prevention of atrocities'
pcso = 'protection of children from sexual'
pcr = 'protection of civil rights'

code_dict = {ipc: "IPC", poa: "PoA", pcso: "PCSO", pcr: "PCR"}

ACT_LENGTH = len(acts) if len(acts) &lt; 5 else 5

if len(acts) &gt; 0:
    collected_acts = [tuple(acts[i].contents) for i in range(ACT_LENGTH)]
    collected_sections = [tuple(sections[i].contents) for i in range(ACT_LENGTH)]
else:
    print("No Act Mentioned")

for i in range(ACT_LENGTH):
    act = str(collected_acts[i]).lower()
    accepted = [code_dict[code] for code in code_dict.keys() if code in act]
    for code in accepted:
        dictionary[code] = collected_sections[i]
print(dictionary)

site_file.close()
</code></pre>

<h1>ACT_LENGTH</h1>

<p>The reason <code>ACT_LENGTH</code> is written that way is because once the length of <code>acts</code> is bigger than <code>5</code>, you only go a set amount instead of the length. Because of this, we want to only loop up to <strong>four</strong> because of how range works. (<code>range(INCLUSIVE, EXCLUSIVE)</code>).</p>

<h1>Use lists!</h1>

<p>Instead of defining new variables based on how big <code>acts</code> is, we can simply use list comprehension to create a list of variables as big as <code>acts</code>.</p>

<h1>Shorten your code with loops</h1>

<p>Instead of checking each individual key with its own <code>if</code> statement, we can organize all the "accepted", meaning codes that are in <code>act</code>, into a list and loop through those to add to the dictionary.</p>

<h1>File handling</h1>

<p>It's always good practice to close a file once you're done using it.</p>

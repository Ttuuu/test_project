<p>Sometimes you might be surprised that your elements do not look the same when viewed in different browsers (eg. different line heights, weird box-sizing, etc.).</p>

<p>One neat trick to avoid this is to include small snippet of CSS called reset stylesheet. </p>

<p>Usual way to do that is to include it as a separate file - eg. <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="path/to/your/stylesheet.css"&gt;</code> or if it is small enough, to inline it - just wrap your code in <code>style</code> tags in your HTML document.</p>

<p>There are various reset stylesheets you can find online, but one of the best is <a href="https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">normalize.css</a>. I suggest you check it out.</p>

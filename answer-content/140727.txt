<p>Firstly, we can observe that the sum of Fibonacci numbers is simply offset from a Fibonacci number. I'll take the convention that \$F_0 = 0\$, \$F_1 = 1\$. Then $$\sum_{i=0}^n F_i = F_{n+2} - 1$$ Proof by induction is easy: \$\sum_{i=0}^{n+1} F_i = F_{n+1} + \sum_{i=0}^n F_i = F_{n+1} + F_{n+2} - 1 = F_{n+3}-1\$.</p>

<p>Secondly, we can observe that since the Fibonacci numbers go odd, odd, even, the sum of the first \$n\$ even Fibonacci numbers is the sum of the first \$2n\$ odd Fibonacci numbers, and half the sum of the first \$3n\$ Fibonacci numbers. I.e. $$\sum_{i=1}^n F_{3n} = \frac{F_{3n+2} - 1}2$$</p>

<p>So you can skip the sum provided that you can compute how many terms you need. And you can <a href="http://cheddarmonk.org/Fibonacci.html" rel="nofollow">compute the \$n\$<sup>th</sup> Fibonacci number in \$O(\lg n)\$ operations</a> using \$F_{m+n} = F_{m+1} F_n + F_m F_{n-1}\$.</p>

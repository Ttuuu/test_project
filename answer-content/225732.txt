<h3>Design Review</h3>

<p>I am not convinced wrapping business layer entity properties in presentation layer is a good pattern for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>It asserts the presentation view of data is strongly related to the business entities. This certainly isn't always the case. Many presentation layers introduce even further denormalized presentation classes than the business entities.</li>
<li>It is a breach of separation of concerns, in that user interaction can immediately adapt business entity state.</li>
<li>By keeping presentation and business entities completely separated, you can focus on client-side end-user validation without impacting the business validation and vice versa.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>Suggested Alternative</h3>

<p>Create custom presentation classes that have no relation to business entities, even if most properties would include 1-1 mappings. Use a factory, builder or mapper pattern to put boiler-plate mapping code between layers in.</p>

<p>You error on missing function pointers when you try and use them. You should error out when you create the list.</p>

<p>Don't printf in library functions, even to stderr. </p>

<p><code>uint16_t</code> only allows 65k elements, this is really tiny for a list.</p>

<p>You don't allow NULL elements. Sometimes you want NULL elements in your list, it's a big reason why one would use a list of pointers instead of a list by value.</p>

<p>There is no way to index into the list or iterate over it.</p>

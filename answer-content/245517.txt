<p>I agree with the previous answer, especially the remarks about using the <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/5.32.0/strict.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">strict</a> and <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/5.32.0/warnings.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">warnings</a> pragmas. I fixed so many Perl bugs which could be seen easily using these pragmas.</p>
<p>First of all you should know that Perl's split command uses regular expression as the delimiter, would you like to dare and write a regular expression based split_string?</p>
<p>Secondly, to make it look more as the Perl's split you could use <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlsub.html#Prototypes" rel="nofollow noreferrer">prototypes</a> (which will also check for correct parameter passing):</p>
<pre><code>sub split_string ($;$);
</code></pre>
<p>Than you can call the function as following (note that there is no need for parenthesis):</p>
<pre><code>my $test = split_string "This is a test to ensure this works correctly.";
</code></pre>
<p>I like to use prototypes when I write basic functions.</p>

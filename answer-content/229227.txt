<pre><code>def game_of_cups(zipcode, rules):
  for num, rule in enumerate(rules, 1):
    points = rule(zipcode)
    total_points += points
    ...

def rule1(zipcode):
  return 5 if (zipcode[0] == zipcode[-1]) else 0

def rule2(zipcode):
  a, b, c, d, e = map(int, zipcode)
  return 6 if (b == 2 * a and c &gt; min(b, d)) else 0

<p>As long as there aren't participation points awarded for any given rule, then this method works for testing to see if the is passed based on the fact that points were awarded.</p>

<p><code>rule_passes</code> was never really used aside from adding the points.</p>

<p>Finally, this allows for more robust point system (and is just as hard coded as the former answer).</p>

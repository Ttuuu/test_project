<p>There's two things I'd change to simplify your code:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use a two dimensional array. Sure you can do the conversion from a 2d position to 1d easily, but the compiler can do and <code>board[1][1]</code> is rather more obviously the middle of the board than <code>board[4]</code>. </li>
<li>Instead of hardcoding your logic for what positions you have to check, think about a programmatic approach using a loop. This not only avoids duplicating lots of code, but also makes it trivial to extend your tic-tac-toe game to a larger board.</li>
</ul>

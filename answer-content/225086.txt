<p>I know in that in English that each word would be separate where the program is printing the all of the numbers merged together. Is this the actual functionality in Japanese?</p>

<p>Since the code might be useful in many places it might be better of the translation code as in a class.</p>

<p><strong>Use of Vertical Space</strong><br>
Generally code is easier to read and maintain when only one value is on a line. This would apply to the initialization of the vectors and the switch statement in the function <code>is_vowel()</code>. For maintenance reasons it is much easier to insert a line where it needs to be than it is to add a value to a comma separated list.</p>

<p><strong>is_vowel function</strong><br>
There would be less code if the vowels were in a std::map rather than a switch statement. Here are discussions on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/931890/what-is-more-efficient-a-switch-case-or-an-stdmap">stack overflow</a> and <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/193786/map-of-functions-vs-switch-statement">software engineering</a>.</p>

<p><em>This portion of the answer has been modified to remove the statement that there might be a performance improvement using std::map. If map used a simple index into an array that might be true, however it is not a simple index into an array.</em></p>

<p><strong>Assert</strong><br>
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8114008/when-should-we-use-asserts-in-c">Assert statements are generally used for debugging purposes and terminate the program</a>. Assert statements may be removed when the code is compiled without debugging as well. I don't expect to see asserts in production level code because it implies that the code is not yet debugged.</p>

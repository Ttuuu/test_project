<p>The code is not entirely wrong but it's not appealing either. Here are a couple of thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In general I'd say this is ok and as far as <code>WinForms</code> are concerned not. Each of the abstract classes should be <code>UserControl</code> that you place in the specific location. This way it would be much easier to design them and I bet it's a pain to get all these indexes correctly.</p></li>
<li><p>You use magic-numbers a lot and many them are the same. Most of them should be constants, problably something like <em>padding</em>, <em>margin</em>, <em>gap</em> etc. It would be much easier to adjust them when they have meanings and do this for all occurances without having to search each one of them.</p></li>
<li><p>I must also say that your naming convention in great need of improvement. Current names are short an confusing. You use a lot of abbreviations that don't mean anything or you use a very unconventional class and method names. You should take a look at some <a href="https://www.dofactory.com/reference/csharp-coding-standards" rel="nofollow noreferrer">C# Coding Standards</a> and try to follow them as much as possible. If you make an exception then you should have a pretty good reason for doing so.</p></li>
</ul>

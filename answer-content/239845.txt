<p>Somebody on another website posted a good idea and I want to share it. They suggested that I make each webpage its own class. Then any private methods that support that webpage are grouped together in the same file, and other webpages and private methods get their own files and aren't cluttering things up.</p>

<p>I could use folders to keep similar pages grouped together.</p>

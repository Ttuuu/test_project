<p>You should definitely not be mixing procedural and object-oriented syntax.</p>
<p>Although it works with un-mixed syntax, the process is working harder than it needs to and delivering more result set data than you intend to use.</p>
<p>I would add <code>COUNT(1)</code> or <code>COUNT(*)</code> to the sql like this:</p>
<pre><code>$sql = "SELECT COUNT(1) FROM notifications WHERE viewed='0' AND user_to = ?";
$query = $this-&gt;con-&gt;prepare($sql);
$query-&gt;bind_param("s", $userLoggedIn);
$query-&gt;execute();
$query-&gt;bind_result($count);
$query-&gt;fetch();
return $count;
</code></pre>
<p>Assuming the sql is not broken due to syntax errors, this will always return a number.</p>

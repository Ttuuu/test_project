<p>Looks pretty good to me! I liked that you used type hints.</p>

<p>A few tips:</p>

<ul>
<li>The library <code>pathlib</code> is very good for path manipulation. You'll still need <code>os.walk</code> in this case, but you can use it to get the full filepath, just the filename, the stem (filename without extension) or the suffix (extension alone). I use it a lot.</li>
<li>You could use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#re.sub" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>re.sub</code></a> to take care of the separators and the removables. It might take some time to learn about regular expressions (short: regex), but it's worth the effort.</li>
<li>It's good practice to use <code>isinstance(object, type)</code> instead of <code>type(object) == type</code>.</li>
<li>It's also good practice to put the code in the bottom under <code>def(main)</code> and call <code>main()</code> under <code>if __name__ == "__main__"</code>.</li>
</ul>

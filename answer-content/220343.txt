<p>From a short review,</p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure that your database has an index: <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/indexes/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/indexes/</a></li>
<li>For the 404, since most countries have more than 1 city, I would return "Cities not found", I might even include the provided country and city in the return message so that the admin can be provided with an informative message</li>
<li>I would have 2 different messages when the input data is bad, one for City, and one for country. Furthermore, for bad input data, I would use return code 400.</li>
<li>It's very minor, but <code>CountryId</code> looks better than <code>countryid</code></li>
<li>Instead of <code>if (isValidCountryid &amp;&amp; isValidStateid) {</code> I would check for bad data, and exit immediately, it makes for a lower cyclomatic complexity</li>
</ul>

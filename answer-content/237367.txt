<p>It's an interesting approach...  Some cleanup to consider...</p>

<pre><code>int i = 0;
</code></pre>

<p><code>i</code> is never used...</p>

<pre><code>rnd.nextInt(52)
</code></pre>

<p>You might want to interrogate the size of <code>deck</code> at the start of the method, rather than using a fixed 'magic' number.  That would mean that you'd be able to use the method to shuffle decks of multiple packs of cards for example...</p>

<pre><code>deck.remove(bottomCard);
</code></pre>

<p>Although you're treating this as a unique case, it's still card 0, I'd consider defining a constant <code>FIRST_CARD_IN_DECK=0</code> to represent the card to remove.</p>

<p>It's unclear where <code>deck</code> comes from should it be passed into the shuffle function?</p>

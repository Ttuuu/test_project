<p>Your requirements could be summed up in a single regex.</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>import re

def is_fqdn(hostname):
    return re.match(r'^(?!.{255}|.{253}[^.])([a-z0-9](?:[-a-z-0-9]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?\.)*([a-z0-9](?:[-a-z0-9]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?[.]?$', re.IGNORECASE)
</code></pre>

<p>I don't particularly condone this very condensed formulation; but this does everything in your requirements.</p>

<p>Here's a rundown.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>^</code> beginning of line / expression</li>
<li><code>(?!.{255}|.{253}[^.])</code> negative lookahead: don't permit 255 or more characters, or 254 where the last is not a dot.</li>
<li><code>([a-z0-9](?:[-a-z-0-9]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?\.)*</code> zero or more labels where the first and last characters are not hyphen, and a max of 61 characters between them can also be a hyphen; all followed by a dot. The last 62 are optional so that we also permit a single-character label where the first character is also the last.</li>
<li><code>([a-z0-9](?:[-a-z0-9]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?</code> the final label does not have to be followed by a dot</li>
<li><code>[.]?</code> but it can be</li>
<li><code>$</code> end of line / expression</li>
</ul>

<p>When you only use a regex once, there is no acute reason to <code>compile</code> it. Python will do this under the hood anyway (and in fact keep a cache of recently used compiled regexes and often reuse them more quickly than if you explicitly recompile).</p>

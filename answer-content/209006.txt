  <p>Rubberduck advises against overwriting variables passed ByVal - e.g in
  the Init method - why?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's</p>

<ul>
<li>a) coding style; keeping the original value in the parameter is supposed to be cleaner code because you can spot all the places where the <em>exact</em> passed in value is used and know where it is not used (but instead a modified/derived/sanitized version of it) and</li>
<li>b) assigning to a by-value parameter may be an error because the programmer intended the value to be seen by the caller, mistakenly thinking it was a <code>ByRef</code>. Your code is "safe" in this respect because you clearly do not assume the parameter is <code>ByRef</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>For best maintainability you should introduce new local variables for your input parameters' sanitized values, and make sure you only use those variables in the function and not accidentally use the original parameter at one place or another.</p>

<p>For my taste, a few more comments would be helpful. Those which are there are ok, though very brief. A rule of thumb: If it's not really obvious, <em>why</em> something is done in a program, explain the <em>reason</em> in a comment. Good example of a comment: <code>'fake raise to grab description text</code> explains <em>why</em> we do a raise here.</p>

<p>In <code>MaskIsInvalid</code>, you don't need to use a pattern and <code>Split</code> to create the array of tokens. Just use <code>tokens = Array("{0}","{1}","{2}")</code>.</p>

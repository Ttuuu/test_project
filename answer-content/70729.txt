<p>Pretty shallow review :</p>

<p>You don't need to write a class for what you are doing (and I suggest you have a look at <a href="http://pyvideo.org/video/880/stop-writing-classes" rel="nofollow">this video</a>). Your class does not encapsulate any data and you just use it to have your functions in a the same entity. I guess things would easier to understand if you were to define <code>classmethod</code> to make it obvious that you won't really rely on any instance whatsoever. However, an even better option would be to just define functions in a <code>indicator</code> module.</p>

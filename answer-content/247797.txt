<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>One small thing I haven't noticed the others mention. You check and handle cases</p>
<pre><code>guess &lt; secret
secret &lt; guess &lt;= max
guess &gt; max
</code></pre>
<p>Yet</p>
<pre><code>min &gt; guess
</code></pre>
<p>seems oddly missing. Your guess is an <code>int</code>, so nothing is preventing me from putting in a negative number. And because your else doesn't check its assumption (<code>secret==guess</code>) I will instantly get the message about winning, yet the loop will continue, because it does its check separately.</p>

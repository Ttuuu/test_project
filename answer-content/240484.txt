<p><strong>What is OOP?</strong></p>

<p>There is more to OOP than just class inheritance and your example shows painfully clearly why class hierarchy is almost always completely unable to represent the real world. If a student is a specialized type of a person, then a person can not be a student and a teacher at the same time (e.g. an assistant to a teaching professor). Also, that person can no longer be a part time employee at the cafeteria either, because the person's status has been locked into being a student and student only. Clearly, class inheritance is the wrong tool here. The relation should be composition:</p>

<pre><code>public class Student {
    private final StudentId studentId;
    private final Person person;

    public Student(StudentId studentId, Person person) {
        this.studentId = studentId;
        this.person = person;
    }

    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Your code works, but is difficult to understand. Especially it is hard to understand what exactly is stored in <code>b</code>, this list contains both integers and strings. The name <code>b</code> also does not give a clue what it used for.</p>

<p>I would suggest a more straight forward method with more descriptive names for variables:</p>

<pre><code>s = "((a+b*d)*(x/2))*(1+(y+(x-2)/10))"

opening_bracket_pos = []
stack = []

for i in range(0, len(s)):
    if s[i] == '(':
        opening_bracket_pos.append(i)
    elif s[i] == ')':
        start_pos = opening_bracket_pos.pop()
        stack.append(s[start_pos: i+1])

print(s)
print(stack)
</code></pre>
    </div>

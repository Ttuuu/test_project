  <p>Is there a library function that could perform this operation? </p>

<p>No.</p>

  <p>Are there pythonic improvements that can be made to my code?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A few.</p>

<p>Sorry it seems boring, but there's not much better you can do.</p>

<p>The biggest change might be to make this into a generator function, which may be a tiny bit neater.  </p>

<pre><code>def chunk(xs, n):
    ys = list(xs)
    random.shuffle(ys)
    size = len(ys) // n
    leftovers= ys[size*n:]
    for c in xrange(n):
        if leftovers:
           extra= [ leftovers.pop() ] 
        else:
           extra= []
        yield ys[c*size:(c+1)*size] + extra
</code></pre>

<p>The use case changes, slightly, depending on what you're doing</p>

<pre><code>chunk_list= list( chunk(range(10),3) )
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>if</code> statement can be removed, also, since it's really two generators.  But that's being really fussy about performance.</p>

<pre><code>def chunk(xs, n):
    ys = list(xs)
    random.shuffle(ys)
    size = len(ys) // n
    leftovers= ys[size*n:]
    for c, xtra in enumerate(leftovers):
        yield ys[c*size:(c+1)*size] + [ xtra ]
    for c in xrange(c+1,n):
        yield ys[c*size:(c+1)*size]
</code></pre>

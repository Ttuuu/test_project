<p>I have a bias <em>toward</em> regex because I'm generally comfortable with most techniques, so I'll recommend condensing your array of delimiters into a single regex pattern and employ <code>preg_split()</code> to execute the explosion.</p>

<p>After splitting the search string into its separate artists, I am flipping the values &amp; keys to optimize the lookup for later use in the nested loop.</p>

<p>Then as you iterate the haystack of artist times, you can re-use the splitting pattern, then iterate each individual artist and store the desired data for qualifying rows.</p>

<p>Code: (<a href="https://3v4l.org/bRaJl" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Demo</a>)</p>

<pre><code>$fullArtistTimes = [
    ['time' =&gt; '18:31:00', 'artist' =&gt; 'LUIS RODRIGUEZ &amp; DEN HARROW'],
    ['time' =&gt; '18:32:00', 'artist' =&gt; 'J BALVIN'],
    ['time' =&gt; '18:33:00', 'artist' =&gt; 'THE BLACK EYED PEAS FT J BALVIN'],
    ['time' =&gt; '18:34:00', 'artist' =&gt; 'THE BLACK EYED PEAS FT J BALVIN'],
    ['time' =&gt; '18:35:00', 'artist' =&gt; 'J BALVIN']
];

$fullArtist = 'THE BLACK EYED PEAS FT J BALVIN';

$artistDelimiters = '~ (?:[+e,&amp;]|and|f(?:ea)?t\.?|vs\.?) ~i';

$artists = array_flip(preg_split($artistDelimiters, $fullArtist));

$result = [];
foreach ($fullArtistTimes as $row) {
    foreach (preg_split($artistDelimiters, $row['artist']) as $artist) {
        if (isset($artists[$artist])) {
            $result[] = "{$artist} is at {$row['time']}";
        }
    }
}

var_export($result);
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>array (
  0 =&gt; 'J BALVIN is at 18:32:00',
  1 =&gt; 'THE BLACK EYED PEAS is at 18:33:00',
  2 =&gt; 'J BALVIN is at 18:33:00',
  3 =&gt; 'THE BLACK EYED PEAS is at 18:34:00',
  4 =&gt; 'J BALVIN is at 18:34:00',
  5 =&gt; 'J BALVIN is at 18:35:00',
)
</code></pre>

<p>If this does not work for all of your cases, then I would need to see more test cases and your desired result before I could properly adjust my snippet.</p>

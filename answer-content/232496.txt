<p>On the whole the code is good, but I would look for three improvements:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Information-hiding:</strong> I would change <code>self.stack</code> to <code>self._stack</code> to indicate to readers of the code that this is an implementation detail that should not be accessed directly.  Reasons:

<ol>
<li>Mutating <code>self.stack</code> directly, for example <code>self.stack.insert(2, 42)</code> could break the expectations a client would have of the stack.</li>
<li>You might choose to use a different data structure in the future, so clients that depended on <code>self.stack</code> being a <code>list</code> would fail.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Error handling:</strong> popping or peeking on an empty stack will raise an <code>IndexError</code>.  It might be friendlier to raise a custom <code>EmptyStackError</code>, although a bare <code>IndexError</code> could still be ok, depending on ...</li>
<li><strong>Documentation:</strong> ideally the code would have docstrings in accordance with <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/" rel="noreferrer">PEP-257</a>.  Failing that, comments in the <code>pop</code> and <code>peek</code> methods explaining that an exception will occur on an empty stack are helpful to the reader, and document that the behaviour is intentional rather than a bug.</li>
</ol>

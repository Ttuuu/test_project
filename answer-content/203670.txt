<p>The code looks generally fine (though a little too sketchy for a good review).  It does look like you have <code>using namespace std;</code> somewhere, which I advise against.</p>

<p>If you know how many elements you'll be adding to your vector, it's always a good idea to reserve sufficient capacity.  This reduces the amount of reallocation it might do if it can only react to the additions, and may help avoid over-allocation:</p>

<pre><code>std::vector&lt;int&gt; ids;
ids.reserve(total_users);
// now, push_back() or transform()
</code></pre>

<p>A time to compute <code>sum(beauty_scores[k:k+muralLength])</code> is proportional to <code>muralLength</code>, which is <code>N/2</code>, and there are <code>N/2</code> iterations. Total time to execute the loop is <span class="math-container">\$O(N^2)\$</span>. TLE.</p>

<p>As a hint, once you've computed the sum for a <code>[0..m]</code> slice, the sum for next slice (<code>[1..m+1]</code>) can be computed much faster. I don't want to say more.</p>

<p><code>range(1, T+1)</code> is unconventional, considering that <code>i</code> is never used. Also, Pythonic style recommends to use <code>_</code> for a dummy loop variable:</p>

<pre><code>    for _ in range(T):
</code></pre>

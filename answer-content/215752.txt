<ul>
<li>My eye started twitching uncontrollably when I saw <code>.Where(x =&gt; x.SupplierID == supplier.ToUpper())</code>. To me, this indicates a major design flaw: something that's called an ID should not be compared to a string that needs to be uppercased.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Names are important. <code>string[] products = [...] .Select(x =&gt; x.ProductCode).ToArray();</code> suggests to me that this should be named <code>productCodes</code>, not <code>products</code>. See also <code>DataTable table</code>: "table" is about as undescriptive as you can get.</li>
</ul>

<li>The best solution would be to investigate if you couldn't replace all this code with a single query.</li>

<p>Obviously, every third Fibonacci number is even, and the rest of them are odd. Less obviously (but trivially follows from, say, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Philippe_Marie_Binet#cite_ref-2" rel="nofollow">Binet's formula</a>), they satisfy another linear recurrence:</p>

<p>\$F_{3(n+1)} = 4 F_{3n} + F_{3(n-1)}\$</p>

<p>Using this fact, you may cut the execution time threefold.</p>

<li><p>Instead of having three different lists, have a list of lists, one per 
week with the quiz questions. This would get rid of redundant code and
make it trivial to add a week.</p></li>
<li><p>keep your data in some kind of file, then load it into a list. This will get rid of all of those constructors in your main function, as well as making it easier to edit your data, or rewrite your program in a different language.</p></li>
<li><p>Abstract things into classes and methods. I can't really understand your code now because I need to keep remember every variable in the entire function and keep track of deeply nested blocks. At the very least abstract out: getting a random stem, asking a stem, and asking an arbitrary number of stems. In my opinion, <strong>decomposing a problem into smaller problems is the most important part of programming</strong>.</p></li>

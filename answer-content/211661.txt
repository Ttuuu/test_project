<p>This is <em>not</em> the standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort" rel="nofollow noreferrer">insertion sort algorithm</a>. Your algorithm has one feature in common with insertion sort, which is that it finds a small element and puts it at the front of the list. However, your algorithm does that by performing one swap, whereas the standard insertion sort does that by shifting all of the larger sorted elements over.</p>

<p>One result of this difference is that your algorithm does not have all of the properties of insertion sort. In particular, your sorting algorithm is not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Stability" rel="nofollow noreferrer">stable</a>. Stability is more of a concern when you are sorting objects rather than primitive ints, but still, this property is significant enough for me to consider your algorithm to fail to qualify as a variant of insertion sort.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>pthread_create</code> returns value which is needed to be checked too; if your system runs out of resources, the new thread might not start.</li>
<li>You are listening on all IPs available; considering that there is no visible authentication, this opens possibility for unauthorized access, impersonation etc. Consider listening on localhost only (enough within one server);</li>
<li>The <code>socket_ids</code> is modified in <code>delete_socket</code> while the mutex is not locked. This creates a race condition if for example a new connection is accepted and at the same time the existing one is closed. Access to <code>socket_ids</code> has to be guarded by mutex.</li>
<li>Same in access call - you're modifying <code>socket_ids</code> without holding mutex.</li>
<li>Unix terminals generally send CRLF (\r\n) as linefeed, so the check for "Bye\n" will not work for those.</li>
</ul>

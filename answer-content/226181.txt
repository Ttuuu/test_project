<p>I did some testing and research on this, AFAIK your script is safe.</p>

<p>However, you should also be aware of how you retrieve the input. For example, what if the String contained a <code>"</code>, followed by executing PHP code. This would be an even worse vulnerability than malicious client-side code.</p>

<p><a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/100769/is-using-htmlentities-or-htmlspecialchars-functions-enough-to-block-xss-attack">This post</a> states old versions of IE may be vulnerable if your char-set is UTF-7, which it probably isn't.</p>

<p>If <code>&lt;div style...&gt;</code> is entered, it will be escaped. Therefore <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> should be included.</p>

<p>I believe every tag can have an <code>onload=script</code>, (E.G <code>&lt;u onload="script"&gt;</code>), so only allowing tags by themselves is a good idea. (As you are already doing)</p>

<p>I suggest adding <code>div</code>, <code>span</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>br</code> and many other tags to the whitelist.</p>

<p>Edit: Since you mentioned you use PHP to <code>echo</code> the output, I also suggest testing using PHP functions or variables  in the input, such as <code>$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']</code>. </p>

<p>Will the output show the result of that variable, or the literal text?</p>

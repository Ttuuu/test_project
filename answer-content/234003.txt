<p>I think Martin’s answer (+1) checks most of the boxes.</p>

<p>First, that having been said, I wonder whether you’ve considered using this within non-countable ranges. For example, would you ever want to use it to generate a pair of floating point values (e.g. two angles whose values are between zero and 2π)? Is that part of what you might want to do? If so, a different pattern would be called for.</p>

<p>Second, I might advise against tuple return type. As soon as you start using a function designed to return two values within a range, someone is going to want to then return three values from the range. A tuple is just too constraining. I’d be inclined to use a set or an array, instead. And even if you wanted to never return more than two values, I’d still ask whether a <code>struct</code> might make more sense, where the functional intent of these two values is more clear (e.g. ordered values, unordered? etc.).</p>

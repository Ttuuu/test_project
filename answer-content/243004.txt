<p>A note on terminology,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>14 has factors [1, 2, 7, 14]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Usually these are called divisors, while the factors of 14 are taken to be only 2 and 7.</p>
<h1>The Algorithm</h1>
<p>While it is not entirely clear to me what you need the result to be, there is an alternative approach to finding the answer to the following question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the number have any factors that are not in the list?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which I hope is a fair re-wording of</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[the number] should not have any other factor as primes other than in the list</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To answer that question, a possible algorithm is:</p>
<p>For each <code>p</code> in <code>primes</code>, as long as <code>n</code> is divisible by <code>p</code>, divide <code>n</code> by <code>p</code>. The "leftover" <code>n</code> at the end is the product of all the factors of the original <code>n</code> that are not in <code>primes</code>.</p>
<p>For example in Python,</p>
<pre><code>def solve(n):
    primes = [2, 3, 5]
    for p in primes:
      while n % p == 0:
        n = n // p
    return n
</code></pre>
<p>Now the result will be 1 if the number <code>n</code> only had the <code>primes</code> as factors, or otherwise it will be whatever is left. In the original function, the leftover would also be essentially be factored (but slowly, and only the first factor is returned). An integer factorization algorithm (there are faster options for that than trial division) could be applied as an extra step to recreate that result, but that is not required to answer the question of whether the number has any other factors that were not in the list <code>primes</code>.</p>
<p>This algorithm would not deal very well with a much longer list of <code>primes</code> (say, millions of primes), but it does deal well with cases such as <code>1926576016</code> where the lowest prime factor which isn't in <code>primes</code> is high.</p>

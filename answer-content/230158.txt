<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>This code looks reasonably clean and seems to accomplish what it's intended to do.
Some minor nitpicks can still be improved here and there:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You're not consistent in visibility modifier ordering between class declaration and member declarations. It should either be <code>public final class</code> or <code>final private static int timeout</code>.<br>
Most Java conventions that I've seen default to the <code>public static final</code> ordering.</p></li>
<li><p><code>handler</code> and <code>logo</code> are currently package-private. It's very unusual for that visibility to be necessary and I think setting these to <code>private</code> if at all possible would be better. (I'm not recommending <code>protected</code>, because the class can not be extended.)</p></li>
<li><p><code>static final</code> members are usually named in <code>SNAKE_CAPS</code> (also known as shout-case).</p></li>
<li><p>the id <code>companylogo</code> might be better off named <code>companyLogo</code> to follow camel case conventions.</p></li>
<li><p><code>myanimation</code> doesn't tell us anything about the animation. A better name would be <code>splashScreenAnimation</code> or <code>logoAnimation</code> </p></li>
</ul>

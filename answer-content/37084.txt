<p>I would have solved it using a regular expression with a replace command. It might not be faster than a well written if-tree, but why write the if-tree yourself when the regex engine will do it for you?</p>

<pre><code>(?:(a)|[^a])
</code></pre>

<p>For instance matches any one character, but only captures the character if it is <code>a</code>. Build the rest of that regex and you have a clean one-liner solution.</p>

<p>Do remember the edge cases, as others have pointed out you forgot to handle the 1 character case in your code, and it is of course also something you need to think about with this method.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Shuffling an array</a> is very different from sorting it randomly. For the shuffling to be fair, you need a random number generator and you must ask it for exactly \$\log_2(n!)\$ bits of randomness, or a multiple thereof. Otherwise it cannot be fair. \$n\$ is the number of elements in the array.</p>

<p>Furthermore, a <em>comparison function</em> must be stable. That means, when I call the function multiple times with the same arguments, it must always return the same value. Your random function doesn't do this. Depending on the sorting algorithm, this can lead to endless loops, exceptions, or generally <em>undefined behavior</em>.</p>

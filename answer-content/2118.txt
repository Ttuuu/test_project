<p>I agree with jathanism - it does look pretty good. It's well organized and doesn't do too much.</p>

<p>You throw an error if an invalid option is selected. Have you considered looping until a correct value is selected?</p>

<pre><code>val = 0
while val &lt; 1 and val &gt; 3
   val = int(raw_input('Enter your choice Number: '))
</code></pre>

<p>Also, you shift the value down to compensate for the 0 relative array. I'd reccomend changing the array to be artificially 1-relative:</p>

<pre><code>l = ['dummy', 'rock', 'paper', 'scissors']
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively you could do the shifting inside <code>getValueFromList</code>. Don't make the caller do it though - they shouldn't have to worry about things like that. Also, you should do some bounds checking - what happens when someone calls <code>getValueFromList(5)</code>? That might be a valid place to throw a <code>ValueError</code>.</p>

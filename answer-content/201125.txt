<p>in your case I would try to avoid subscribing to events as this couples the projects and references and prevents the garbage collector to clean up the unused service. if you are creating new services per use (probably you do) you would have a list of services which stay in memory and GC cant collect them because of the event subscription. </p>

<p>Instead you can create an event service and subscribe through the event service. in the event service you would have a list of weak references to the subscribers. this would prevent objects being in the memory unnecessarily.</p>

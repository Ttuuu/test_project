<p>The <code>ContainsKey</code> way is cleaner I think so I prefer it in any way.</p>

<p>About performance, it's depend if your case, take in mind that check for contains key and then add key is do almost the same twice. So if all add operations result as success, the <code>try\catch</code> will be faster also if just some false occurred, but in the most case, the <code>ContainsKey</code> will be faster.</p>

<h2>Use a common protocol file</h2>

<p>Any common constants, such as</p>

<ul>
<li>9600</li>
<li><code>SYN</code>, <code>ACK</code>, etc. strings</li>
</ul>

<p>should be <code>#define</code>d in one place, in this case a <code>.h</code> file accessible to both Arduino projects.</p>

<h2>Indentation</h2>

<p>One-space indentation is essentially never used. Typically four is used instead.</p>

<h2>Globals</h2>

<p>In the master code, every single one of those globals should be moved to <code>loop()</code> and declared <code>static</code>. That way they will retain their value through multiple calls but will also have their scope reduced.</p>

<h2>Efficiency</h2>

<p>I realize a lot of these may fall outside of the constraints of your assignment; nevertheless:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't use software-serial; use a hardware serial port</li>
<li>Don't use Arduino; use smaller microcontrollers that are better-suited to your application</li>
<li>Don't use ASCII string signalling; use single-byte constants. If fidelity is a concern, add a checksum.</li>
</ul>

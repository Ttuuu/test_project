<p>In your current implementation you are caching the users in <code>users</code> field in <code>UserManager</code>, but this has a chance of data loss if there are multiple instances of the application is run and new user are created there.</p>

<p>Password should always be hashed. Though I understand it is an internal app, this is a good practice to ensure anyone's password is not accidentally exposed.</p>

<p><code>getUserNames</code> is a more appropiate/simpler name instead of <code>retainUserNames</code>.</p>

<p>In <code>UserManager.createUser</code> method, instead of returing exact error message return an enum or error code and then render the error message based on that in your CLI app. This makes handling/updating error messages or providing multilingual support easier later.</p>

<p>Though not a high priority for a simple program such as this, I would recommend using a cli library for parsing command line arguments.</p>

<p>There seems to be no way to update a user's password.</p>

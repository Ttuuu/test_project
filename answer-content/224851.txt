<p>This solution doesn't look correct to me. Where's <code>2</code>? Why's <code>7</code> in there twice? Why are <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> sometimes arrays and sometimes tree nodes?</p>

<p>I guess you meant to use <code>slice</code> instead of <code>splice</code> (which might explain the fate of that missing <code>2</code>), and probably want to exclude the node value in the <code>right</code> branch (which might explain the extra <code>7</code>).</p>

<p>If I were writing something like this, I'd probably drop that BinaryTreeNode class, since it's not really doing anything, and use a plain object. Bitwise right shift might be a little less noisy than divide and floor, and you could just do that once since you're gonna use it three times.</p>

<p>Maybe something like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>function makeBST(a) {
    let len = a.length
    let mid = len &gt;&gt; 1
    return len ? {
        value: a[mid],
        left: makeBST(a.slice(0, mid)),
        right: makeBST(a.slice(mid + 1, len)),
    } : null
}
</code></pre>

<p>Season to taste with semicolons.</p>

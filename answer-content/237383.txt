<p>To get a historically correct impression of programming in C, K&amp;R is probably the best book available. In addition to that book, you should also get a more modern book about C since K&amp;R doesn't teach you anything about function prototypes and buffer overflows (one of the main reasons that software written in C is often unreliable).</p>

<p>For example, <a href="https://clc-wiki.net/wiki/K%26R2_solutions:Chapter_1:Exercise_12" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the page you linked</a> has a solution containing <code>char buffer[1024];</code>. That solution will fail with unpredictable behavior as soon as you pass it a file containing very long words, as the buffer will overflow and the C program will not reliably crash but is free to do anything it wants, including crashing or making daemons fly out of your nose. This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_behavior" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><em>undefined behavior</em></a>.</p>

<p>There's not much to improve about your code. To make it modern, you simply have to replace one line:</p>

<pre><code>main()              // before
int main(void)      // after
</code></pre>

<p>After that, you should tell your editor to <em>format the source code</em>. This will indent the innermost line <code>c = getchar()</code> a bit more, so that it is clearly inside the <code>while</code> loop.</p>

<pre><code>// before:
while(c == ' '|| c == '\t' || c == '\n')
 c = getchar();

// after:
while (c == ' '|| c == '\t' || c == '\n')
    c = getchar();
</code></pre>

<p>Some other reviewers will say that you <em>must always use braces</em> in the <code>if</code> and <code>while</code> statements, but I disagree. It's enough to let your editor or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment" rel="nofollow noreferrer">IDE</a> format the source code automatically, this will make it obvious when your code is indented wrongly.</p>

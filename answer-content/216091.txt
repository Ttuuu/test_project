<p>A few things that stuck out to me:</p>

<p>You don't gain anything by having the <code>Node</code> class public.  The user of your linked list should only need to be concerned about the data.</p>

<p>It seems very illogical to me to have the <code>Node</code> class printing the <code>LinkedList</code>.  This should more properly be only part of the <code>LinkedList</code> itself.  It would probably be advantageous though for the <code>Node</code> class to override the <code>ToString()</code> method to make it easier to print the data.</p>

<p>From a quick perusal, I couldn't see any use for the <code>previous</code> property except in the <code>RemoveNode</code> method.  I would suggest keeping it local to that method.</p>

<p>A comment explaining the purpose of the <code>AddLastTwo</code> method.  To me it appears to iterate over the list to find the last node, instead of using the <code>last</code> property of the class, like the <code>AddLast</code>.</p>

<p>To me names like <code>AddLast</code> and <code>RemoveNode</code> are over complicated.  If a node isn't being added to the end then it would be an insert operation not an add.  It shouldn't be necessary to tell the user that it's being added to the end.  Likewise the user doesn't need to know that the data is stored in a node, they are simply concerned with removing the data.</p>

<p>When you are using default <code>get</code> and <code>set</code> methods it's much easier to use the default syntax:</p>

<pre><code>public Node&lt;T&gt; next{get;set;}
</code></pre>

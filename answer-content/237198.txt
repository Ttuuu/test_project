<p>Just looking at this one section:</p>

<pre><code>if (key.ToUpper() == "EXIT" || key == null)
    Environment.Exit(1);
else if (key[0] &gt; 71 || key[0] &lt; 65)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Invalid key, try again.");
    goto Start;
}
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Why <code>Environment.Exit(1)</code> and not simply <code>exit(1)</code>?</li>
<li>Given that the program has already exited for the true condition, there is no point in having the <code>else</code>.</li>
<li><p>Where do "71" and "65" come from?<br>
Other than "0", "1", and "many", raw numbers should never appear in code.<br>
In this case they are actually the ASCII values for "A" and "G".<br>
So why not simply say <code>'A'</code> and <code>'G'</code>?</p></li>
<li><p>"<em>Invalid key, try again.</em>" is a very frustrating error message.<br>
Don't tell me that it <em>is</em> invalid; tell me <em>why</em> it is invalid.<br>
And why is "Burble" considered valid?</p></li>
<li><p>There are times when <code>goto</code> is appropriate.<br>
But such times are few and far between, and definitely not in this program.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Similar comments apply to most of the rest of the program.</p>

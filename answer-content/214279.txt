<p>It would be better practice to separate your I/O from your game logic. Your Adventure Class should not create its own <code>Scanner</code>s and manually call <code>System.out.println</code>.</p>

<p>The game class should take an input stream of sorts and an output stream of sorts. Then, the class's methods would pull input from the input stream and then give output to the output stream. This allows for purely game logic to be in your game adventure class.</p>

<p>The <code>main</code> method could pass in a <code>Scanner</code> and <code>System.out</code> to the game class upon instantiation. Then, you could create unit testing classes and manually create and fill input streams so that you can control the behavior of the class automatically.</p>

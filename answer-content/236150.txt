<p>In this case I would clearly go with the more concise version 2.</p>

<p>In general it can improve readability to assign complex expressions to variables with meaningful names and I would always prefer this to adding a comment. However, in this case there is neither the necessity to add a comment nor is the variable name <code>array</code> very meaningful. Just the opposite: You have to decode the second line by looking up <code>array</code> one line above if you want to understand what's going on.</p>

<p>Personally I would shorten the code some more:</p>

<pre><code>function count(string) {
    return string.split("").filter(e =&gt; e === "a").length
}
</code></pre>

<p>In my opinion, the name <code>element</code> doesn't add much information here, so you might as well write <code>e</code> or <code>x</code>. When variable scope is very short, these short names are fine. When you read this code, you will never wonder where the hell this variable <code>e</code> is coming from and what it means. It literally refers to something defined on the same line.</p>

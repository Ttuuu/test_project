<li>Typo in method name as pointed out by <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/190395/find-all-pairs-in-an-array-that-sum-to-a-given-number-without-using-hashmap/190429#190429">@Stingy</a>. Should be <code>findAllPairs</code>.</li>
<li>Accessing wrong array: You are reading values from <code>input</code> instead of your sorted copy <code>numbers</code>. This is probably a typo. E.g. <code>int sum = input[low] + input[high];</code> should be <code>int sum = numbers[low] + numbers[high];</code></li>
<li><p>Your <code>for</code> loop has an empty update statement, this isn't wrong per-se but a bit unusual. Consider an alternative using <code>while</code> instead:</p>

<pre><code>int low = 0, high = numbers.length-1;
while (low &lt; high) {
    int sum = numbers[low] + numbers[high];
    //...
}
</code></pre></li>
<li>Insufficient test: As evidenced by its failure to catch the bug in 2. the test is too limited to be of much help. Consider checking more than one example (especially corner-cases like an empty input array) and checking against the expected output instead of just its size.</li>

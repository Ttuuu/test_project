<p>Other answers gave you great tips for the PEP8 compliance, implicit falseyness for empty lists and naming/style conventions.  These are the first things I would have said if I code reviewed this first.</p>
<p>I wanted to add, if you are going to stick with the <code>isinstance</code> approach, that you can keep it while making your function a generator by replacing <code>return</code> with <code>yield</code>.  You still have recursion, but now it will <code>yield from</code> itself instead of <code>return</code>ing itself.</p>
<p>Something like:</p>
<pre><code>def flatten(element):
    if isinstance(element, list):
        for item in element:
            yield from flatten(item)
    else:
        yield(element)
</code></pre>
<p>Just note that because it is a generator, you have to wrap it with <code>list()</code> to print output.</p>
<pre><code>list(flatten(['a','b',['c','d']])) 
--&gt; ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
</code></pre>

<p>A few random, disconnected thoughts:</p>

<h1>Reading Card Textures</h1>

<p>You say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are 2 aspects of this class that I don't like.</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><p>The Cards in the cardIdentifiers container must have a strict ordering that matches the one in the Textures folder (see it on GitHub). If one changes any card's place in that container, the textures won't be corresponding to the actual card anymore.</p></li>
  <li><p>I had to name all the textures in such a way that the folder will be traversed in alphabetical order. If one changes the name of a texture file, everything will be messed up.</p></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree this is less than ideal. Why not name the images based on their rank and suit? For example, instead of <code>11.png</code>, why not name it <code>2clubs.png</code> or something like that? Then you can match the rank with the image by parsing the name. If someone puts a new image in the directory, either it automatically gets matched up with the correct card, or you immediately know something's wrong and can display an error and bail (or whatever's appropriate).</p>

<h1>Rendering</h1>

<p>Your rendering code is sprinkled throughout your game logic. I think your architecture would be cleaner if instead you drew the current game state, then handled the user input and updated the game state. I'd have a function like <code>drawCurrentGameState()</code>, and call it at the start of the game loop. It would draw everything using the current state of the game. This would make it easier to change the drawing code in the future, since it would all be in one place.</p>

<h1>Naming</h1>

<p>I like most of your variable and function naming. However, these monstrosities have got to go:</p>

<pre><code>void printInformationAboutThePlayerAndTheTopCardFromPile(Player const&amp; player) noexcept;

void printInformationAboutThePlayerAndTheTopCardFromPile(Player const&amp; player, Rank rank) noexcept;
</code></pre>

<p>First, you're not printing anything. You're drawing now, so I'd rename them to <code>draw</code> . Second, the names are simply too verbose. You don't need to say "InformationAboutThe". Anything related to the player that you're going to draw or print is <em>information about the</em> player. So how about just <code>drawPlayerAndTopCard()</code> or <code>drawPlayerAndCardPile()</code>?</p>

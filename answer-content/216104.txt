<p>A few empty lines here and there would do wonders to the readability.</p>

<p>This will also relaunch the application if it was started from a terminal without arguments.</p>

<pre><code>String path = new File(Main.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation().toURI()).getAbsolutePath();

<p>Unfortunately that is a quite fragile way to detect the current operating system, but it will do.</p>

<hr>

<p>On nay other operating system, you simply start reading commands (or not), are you aware of that?</p>

<p>You should have the command reading in an <code>else</code> branch.</p>

<hr>

<pre><code>System.exit(0);
</code></pre>

<p>Please stop sprinkling your code with those. <code>System.exit</code> makes the JVM exit <strong><em>immediately</em></strong>, it is like a SIGKILL on UNIX. That means that not even <code>final</code> branches are being run when invoked.</p>

<hr>

<pre><code>while(true)
    nextCommand();
</code></pre>

<p>I assume that there is a "quit" command which calls <code>System.exit</code>, that might be a bad idea. A better idea would be to have something like this:</p>

<pre><code>while(commandExecutor.isActive()) {
    commandExecutor.readAndExecuteCommand());
}
</code></pre>

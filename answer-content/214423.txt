<p>Formatting - if the code looks the same in your editor as it does here, you could really do with an automatic indentation tool (many editors have that built-in, or you could use GNU Indent, for instance).</p>
<p>I'll assume that the inconsistent indentation is due to the way you've copied your code into the site; a good way to avoid problems is to consistently use either spaces or tabs for indentation, but never to mix the two.</p>
<hr>
<p>It's a good idea to specify that <code>main()</code> takes no arguments:</p>
<pre><code>int main(void)
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p>When we read input, we <em>must</em> check whether it was successful or not:</p>
<pre><code>int physics;
if (scanf("%d", &amp;physics) == 1) {
   // physics has been set, and we can safely use it
} else {
   // physics is still uninitialised
}
</code></pre>
<p>If input fails, then we might want to re-ask (but be careful about doing this if we reach end of the input stream, or we'll try and try again, indefinitely).</p>
<p>Output can also fail, but for this application, that's less of a concern.</p>
<hr>
<p>There's an unused argument to <code>printf()</code> here:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>printf(" MEAN OF :  %.2f\t",mean, round(mean) );
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>That suggests that you could enable more compiler warnings (e.g. <code>gcc -Wall -Wextra</code> - other compilers should have similar options).</p>
<hr>
<p>If <code>mean</code> is between (say) 59.0 and 60.0, then it will fall in between the grade boundaries, and no grade will be printed.  The easy way to avoid this is to use <code>else if</code>:</p>
<pre><code>if (mean &gt;= 70) {
    puts("AND THE  GRADE IS A");
} else if (mean &gt;= 60) {
    puts("AND THE  GRADE IS B");
} else if (mean &gt;= 50) {
    puts("AND THE  GRADE IS C");
} else if (mean &gt;= 40) {
    puts("AND THE  GRADE IS D");
} else {
    puts("AND THE  GRADE IS E");
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, exactly one of those blocks will be executed.</p>
<p>I also changed the <code>printf()</code> to <code>puts()</code> there - prefer the simpler function when you just need to print a single string and a newline.</p>
<hr>
<h1>More advanced ideas</h1>
<p>Should the grade thresholds be fixed in the code?  If they change, you need to re-compile the program.  Think about how you might read them from a configuration file.</p>
<p>Should the list of subjects be fixed?  How would you make the program more flexible for students of different courses?</p>

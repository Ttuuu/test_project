<ul>
<li>Firstly you need to look at the way your code is formatted, you
should increase the indent after every opening brace. </li>
<li>You have a number variables that are declared and not initialised.   </li>
<li>System ("pause") could be replaced with printf ("Press enter to continue\n"); fgetc(stdin); </li>
<li>GOTO there is almost never an excuse for using GOTO statements. </li>
<li>Try using functions to breakdown your code and eliminate repeated code, functions should be up to 20 lines long ideally, may be a hundred lines in exception circumstances.</li>
<li>Personally I don't like you Java style brace use.  IMO each brace should be on a separate line. </li>
<li>Namespaces are there to provide a way of resolving ambiguity, the using namespace std; line takes this function away. Personally I think that line should be removed and you should always prefix the calls with the namespace. In this case it will make no difference, but as you progress you might find your self calling a function in the wrong namespace because of this shortcut. Again it's just my opinion and I know people will disagree.</li>
</ul>

<p>Try recoding it and post it again and see what I can find wrong with it next time :)</p>

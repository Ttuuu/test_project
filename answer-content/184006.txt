<h3>Incorrect</h3>
<p>This code will return a loop where none exists, if the list contains two of the same integer.  For example, take this list without a loop:</p>
<pre><code>1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 2 -&gt; null
</code></pre>
<p>When your code reaches the 2nd <code>2</code>, it will think it detected a loop.</p>
<h3>Next not needed</h3>
<p>In your code you look ahead to "next" unnecessarily.  In fact, you are even skipping over the first element of the list, which could lead to returning the wrong node.  Your code could simplify to:</p>
<pre><code>HashSet&lt;Integer&gt; set = new HashSet&lt;Integer&gt;();
LinkedListNode current = head;
while (current != null &amp;&amp; !set.contains(current.data)) {
    set.add(current.data);
    current = current.next;
}
return current;
</code></pre>
<p>Although remember that this code has the bug mentioned above, so it merely checks for duplicate elements, not for the existence of a loop.</p>

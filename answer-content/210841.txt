<p>One problem with your code would be the distribution of values for some of the functions that might not match the expected distribution (usually linear) or might not even be inside the specified range.</p>

<p>One example would be <code>RandomDouble</code> with arguments 10 and 20. You would multiply a number between 0.0 and 1.0 with a number between 10 and 20. In that case, most of the returned number would be below 10.0 and you would have an higher probability to get a number between 10 and 11 than a number between 19 and 20.</p>

<p>For <code>RandomChar</code> often, you would probably want a mix of uppercase and lowercase with possibly numbers and punctuation (think a password) so as written, the function might often be almost useless.</p>

<p><code>RandowInt64</code> will also not properly respect the specified range. Some values would never be returned and you probably also could have some out of range values. In particular, you cannot simply join two 32 bit numbers like that if the range can include negative values.</p>

<p>Another thing that is strange is that for some types, you assume that you always want the whole range while for other types, you ask the user for the range.</p>

<p>It is also weird that the default range for an <code>Int64</code> is the range of an <code>Int32</code>.</p>

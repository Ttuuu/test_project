<p>Considering you are using the same numbers as their example, I assume you're already aware of the binary search <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/binary_search" rel="noreferrer">algorithm</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Regarding coding style I prefer a space between flow control statements and the parenthesis but that is purely subjective.</p></li>
<li><p>Don't compare to <code>nullptr</code>. Do <code>if (!data)</code> instead.</p></li>
<li><p>IMO Not much use in printing out <code>what()</code> if you don't provide (meaningful) messages along with your exception.<br>
Could also specialize it.<br>
e.g.: <code>std::invalid_argument("no input provided")</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Could use brace initialization if you want to use more modern C++ features (nitpick: <code>mid</code> is not initialized).</p></li>
<li><p>Why didn't you use <code>vector</code>? It's pretty much a drop-in replacment. You could then also use the range for loop.</p></li>
<li><p><code>return 0</code> is implicit in <code>main</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

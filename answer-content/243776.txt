<p>A good next step in your code would be to test edge cases and account for them. A couple things you could improve:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Your code does not handle division by zero. If someone puts in <code>1 / 0</code> your program will crash. You can check for this and give the user a nice error message</p>
</li>
<li><p>Your code does not handle integer overflow. You'll get interesting results if you try to do <code>2000000000 * 2000000000</code> because an <code>int</code> can only hold so large of a value.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Since we're playing code golf, this is passable - but please don't do it in production. It's too confusing. I've taken the liberty of using Python 3 despite the question being tagged for 2; if you really need it for 2 I can provide an alternative (that will be longer).</p>

<pre><code>h, w = (int(input(f'Enter EVEN {dim} of trellis: ')) for dim in ('height', 'width'))
arrow = r'\/'
print('{horz}\n{rows}{horz}'.format(horz='--'*(w + 1),
    rows=f'|{arrow[::-1] * w}|\n|{arrow * w}|\n' * h))

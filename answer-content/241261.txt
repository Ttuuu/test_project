<p>This is not a review, but an extended comment.</p>

<p>Project Euler problems are about math, not programming. To optimize, you need to do the math homework first:</p>

<ol>
<li>The <span class="math-container">\$n\$</span>'th triangular number is <span class="math-container">\$\dfrac{n (n+1)}{2}\$</span>. </li>
<li>A number of divisors, aka <span class="math-container">\$\sigma_0\$</span>, is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_function" rel="noreferrer">multiplicative function</a>. The link to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisor_function" rel="noreferrer">divisor function</a> may also be interesting.</li>
<li><span class="math-container">\$n\$</span> and <span class="math-container">\$n+1\$</span> are coprime.</li>
</ol>

<p>That should be enough to get you started with optimization.</p>

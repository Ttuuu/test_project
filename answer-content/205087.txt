<p>Looks good. I'm not sure what feedback you are looking for, but here's a little:</p>

<ul>
<li>use <code>const</code> where you can, instead of <code>let</code></li>
<li>the naming is a little confusing at times, hash vs. key. Maybe if you call the <code>hash</code> function <code>calcHash</code> then you can call the value it returns a <code>hash</code> and not have to call it a <code>bucketKey</code>... or maybe the function should be <code>calcBucketKey</code>.</li>
<li>it seems like the scoping of <code>arr</code> may be off... especially in <code>expandArr</code>. I believe the argument is going to override the global definition, so I don't think that the last line that re-assigns <code>arr</code> is going to change the global, but rather a local variable going out of scope.</li>
<li>consider using the modulo operator to loop around the array. It can save some checks against the array size.</li>
</ul>

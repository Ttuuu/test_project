<p>Also a beginner but one thing I would like to point out is naming function, <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#function-names" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Style Guide for Python Code</a> states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Function Names<br>
  Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.</p>
  
  <p>mixedCase is allowed only in contexts where that's already the prevailing style (e.g. threading.py), to retain backwards compatibility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, in your case write <code>bubble_sort</code> instead of <code>bubbleSort</code>.</p>

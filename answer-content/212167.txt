<h3>Lots of lists</h3>

<p>Every time you call <code>letters</code>, <code>upper_case</code>, <code>special_char</code> or <code>all_char</code>, you are creating a new list which will be no different from the other lists that were previously created.  You can make these variables that are assigned once and used everywhere.</p>

<h3>Repeated checks</h3>

<p>For every password you generate, you are checking its validity twice: once at the end of the loop, and the other on the <code>while</code> line.  The former serves no purpose, and should be removed.</p>

<h3>Unused assignment</h3>

<p>The assignment to <code>password = ''</code> inside your <code>while</code> loop is unused, and can be removed.</p>

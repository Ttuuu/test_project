<p>Return start is incorrect. That will only happen if the target is not in the array, so you'll just end up with effectively a random index. Instead, I would use the Iterator pattern to return an Iterator to the target within the array instead of its index. That way you can handle the "not found" case as well.</p>

<p>Another simpler approach to this would be to just return -1, but then the client has to check against a "magic number", which is generally not a good thing.</p>

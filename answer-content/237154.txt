<p>So, you want to count something and afterwards get the top <code>k</code>? That sounds like a job for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="noreferrer"><code>collections.Counter</code></a>!</p>

<pre><code>from collections import Counter

def leading_candidates(votes, timestamp, k):
    vote_counts = Counter(vote['candidate']
                          for vote in votes
                          if vote['timestamp'] &lt;= timestamp)
    return [candidate[0] for candidate in vote_counts.most_common(k)]


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(leading_candidates(votes, timestamp, 2))
</code></pre>

<p>This way you don't need to special case a candidate not yet having received a vote (something you could have also done with a <code>collections.defaultdict(int)</code>). And it is <span class="math-container">\$\mathcal{O}(n)\$</span>.</p>

<p>Also note that if <code>k</code> is large, the line <code>if candidates[candidate] in sorted_votes</code> will become slow, as it is a linear scan. At the same time, you can iterate over the keys and values of a dictionary at the same time with <code>candidates.items()</code>, so you don't need to do <code>candidates[candidate]</code>.</p>

<p>Python has an official style-guide, <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="noreferrer">PEP8</a>, which recommends using spaces after commas, which you forgot to do before <code>k</code> in the function signature.</p>

<p>You should always guard your code with an <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/419163/what-does-if-name-main-do"><code>if __name__ == "__main__":</code> guard</a> to allow importing from the script without running it.</p>

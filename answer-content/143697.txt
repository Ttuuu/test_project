<p>With the utmost respect to @alexwlchan i disagree: considerations as to implementations must consider the purpose of the program and how you expect to use it: if you are only entering 10 numbers in, then it may well be easier to stuff all the numbers in an array and call max/min on the array. Memory is not an issue. Fundamentally there is a great danger in over designing and in such cases, quick and dirty works best. personally i hate using while loops - please note that i've written it in ruby, but you should be able to quite easily understand what is going on.</p>

<pre><code># prompts user to enter numbers until 'done' is typed, max and min numbers are printed
numbers = []

while 
    puts "Enter a number (or type 'done' to finish)"
    input = gets.chomp.to_f

# adds input to numbers array (or exits from loop if required)

if input == 'done'
    break
else
    numbers &lt;&lt; input
end

end

puts "Max number is: #{numbers.max }"
puts "Min number is: #{numbers.min}"
</code></pre>

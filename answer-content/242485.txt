<p>I normally would agree with <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/242481">Graipher here</a>, however with your code I think there's a simpler and more readable solution.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The first number doesn't have to be larger than the second.</p>

<p>This is an artificial limitation that can be fixed by sorting the inputted values.</p></li>
<li><p>Not allowing the same value to be selected is an artificial limitation. <code>random.randint</code> includes both bounds, meaning <code>random.randint(n, n)</code> is valid input.</p></li>
<li><p>You can bundle the first two try statements together to simplify the code.</p>

<p>This makes the code DRY as the two loops are logically doing two different things.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Whilst longer it keeps the functionality to change the lower bound if you enter it incorrectly, without having to kill the process.</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>import random

while True:
    try:
        min_, max_ = sorted([
            int(input("Please enter one of the bounds: "))
            int(input("Please enter the other bound: "))
        ])
        break
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input")

while True:
    try:
        amount = int(input("How many times do you want to roll the dice: "))
        break
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input")

for _ in range(amount):
    print(random.randint(min_, max_))
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: You can move both the <code>while</code> <code>try</code> loops into a function, and pass a lambda, however I don't think that's as readable.</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>min_, max_ = while_try(lambda: sorted([
    int(input("Please enter one of the bounds: "))
    int(input("Please enter the other bound: "))
]))
</code></pre>

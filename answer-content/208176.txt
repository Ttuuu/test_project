<p>I don't see any obvious omissions or bugs.</p>

<p>The naming and inner struct are neatly expressive (and remind me of some testing frameworks' precondition/assertion chaining).  It's not something that's done by the standard library, but I don't think it should be hugely controversial.</p>

<p>I might go with a naming like <code>copy_const&lt;foo&gt;::from&lt;bar&gt;</code> - or perhaps even the other way around: <code>copy_const&lt;bar&gt;::to&lt;foo&gt;</code>.  Or even both!  (Actually, I now wish <code>std::is_assignable</code> worked like that - it would be easier to remember which parameter is which!)</p>

<p>None of the above is a concrete suggestion - intended merely as food for thought!</p>

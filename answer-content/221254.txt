<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>You could use this code for checking whether it has an uppercase/lowercase:</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>if s.lower() == s:
    # doesn't have any uppercase
if s.upper() == s:
    # doesn't have any lowercase
</code></pre>

<p>This way, you don't have to iterate through the entire string.</p>
    </div>

<p>Your code works. But can be improved.</p>

<p>Your current code allocates several objects on the heap even though it doesn't need to. Also, the Collections.max takes a lot of time.</p>

<p>I have a completely different approach here. So I will just post the code I wrote some time ago (maybe a couple of years ago). It looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public static int binaryGap(int n) {
    n &gt;&gt;&gt;= Integer.numberOfTrailingZeros(n);
    int steps = 0;
    while ((n &amp; (n + 1)) != 0) {
        n |= n &gt;&gt;&gt; 1;
        steps++;
    }
    return steps;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Try to understand the code by adding some print statements. Post a comment if you have any questions. </p>

<p>Some tests:</p>

<pre><code>Method "solution" Answer: 5
Time Taken: 393061 nanoseconds
Method "binaryGap" Answer: 5
Time Taken: 26053 nanoseconds
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see here, "solution" method is about 15 times slower than the "binaryGap" method because this code runs in O(gap), which is a bit better than O(bits).</p>

<p>Hope this helps. Good luck.</p>

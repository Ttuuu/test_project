<p>Im impressed that you used selection sort. The standard bubble sort method would be slower. Have a look at the bubble sort method anyway.</p>

<pre><code>int n = arr.length, r;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) 
{
    for (int (j = i + 1); j &lt; n; j++) 
    {
        if (arr[i] &gt; arr[j]) 
        {
            r = arr[i];
            arr[i] = arr[j];
            arr[j] = r;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You could also have used the default <code>Arrays.sort</code> method</p>

<pre><code>Arrays.sort(arr);
</code></pre>

<p>You are creating an applet. In this case, it would probably be good to declare the main method as <code>static</code></p>

<p>When you are importing the packages, why have you imported the individual classes <em>after</em> importing them by wildcard character '*'; There is no need for it.
That is redundant and the computer wastes time re-importing and garbage-collecting. Just do:</p>

<pre><code>import java.util.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*; 
import javax.swing.*;
</code></pre>

<p>Also, printing mistake here:</p>

<pre><code>String input_1 = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(frame, "How many numbers do you want to sort with SSSP ?");
</code></pre>

<p>Consider setting bounds to the buttons and text boxes in your mainframes, to make the locations more exact. That way, it will be easier to add a new GUI component to the window when you want to add it. 
The command goes:
<code>&lt;name of object&gt;.setBounds(//x-axis from left, //y-axis from top, //width, //height)</code>
For example:</p>

<pre><code>t2 = new JTextField("Here are your sorted numbers : " + Arrays.toString(arr2));
t2.setBounds(20, 40, 75, 10);
main_frame.add(t2);

JButton buttonEnd = new JButton("Close application");
t2.setBounds(95, 40, 75, 10);
main_frame.add(buttonEnd);

JButton buttonRetry = new JButton("Try again !");
t2.setBounds(180, 40, 75, 10);
main_frame.add(buttonRetry);
</code></pre>

<p>WHY have you named your class <code>AWTCounter</code>? That makes me think you are counting numbers with certain properties or words in a sentence. Won't <code>AWTSorter</code> be better?</p>

<p>Great program though, especially if it's your first!</p>

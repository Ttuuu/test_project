<p>There's too much code here to be able to quickly review it to find your performance bottlenecks.  I'd recommend running it under a performance profiler to see which specific functions your program spends the most time executing so you can focus your optimization on those functions:</p>

<p>This did jump out at me, though:</p>

<pre><code>time.sleep(0.001)
</code></pre>

<p>because it's executed in the <code>update</code> function of each individual object, and since this program is single-threaded, everything else is going to be paused while that sleep is happening, so the more objects you have in the game, the slower each update cycle will be.  If you have a hundred objects, it'll take a tenth of a second to update them all, and if your screen refresh is blocked on that, that means you're getting at best 10fps.  </p>

<p>What you probably want to do is have a single timer that triggers an update on all the objects.</p>

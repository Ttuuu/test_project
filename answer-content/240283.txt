<p>Looks good to me. You can split calculating the days to two lines if you think it's more readable that way.</p>

<pre><code># Calculate full day difference
# Assuming negative difference should be 0
days = diff.days if diff.days &gt; 0 else 0
# Add one if not exactly the same clock
days += 1 if diff.seconds &gt; 0 else 0
# Or a little bit shorter
days += 1 if diff.seconds else 0
</code></pre>

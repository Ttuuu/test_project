<p>Not bad at all. Some remarks:</p>

<ul>
<li>The class should be parameterized and an instance should be used rather than just static methods.</li>
<li>I'd never make the class itself dependent on a configured <code>Pepper</code> value (it's fine for an application to be configurable, but not for a class instance).</li>
<li>The salt and pepper can be simply concatenated instead of using HMAC for the password &amp; pepper.</li>
<li>The salt and pepper are both 32 bytes, which is a bit much; using 16 bytes for both is fine.</li>
<li>The iteration count on the other hand is on the low side and should really be configurable.</li>
<li>A lot of static functions are used. It should not be necessary to make all these public (for instance the hex decoder).</li>
<li>There should be a protocol description, which should also contain things like base 64 encoding and UTF-8 encoding.</li>
</ul>

<p>Very clear variable and method naming. However you messed up a bit for the final method:</p>

<pre><code>public static bool ValidatePassword(string password, string testPassword)
</code></pre>

<p>... the <code>password</code> is the previously hashed password and <code>testPassword</code> a real password? That's completely unclear.</p>

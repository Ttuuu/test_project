<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>Your code is performing integer division for the vector, which is bound to fail:</p>

<pre><code>public void div(Vector vector) {
    this.x /= vector.x;
    this.y /= vector.y;
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, if the input vector is say x = 10 and y = 10, and we are x = 19 and y=19, the result will be:</p>

<pre><code>this.x = 1;
this.y = 1;
</code></pre>

<p>which is counterintuitive.</p>

<p>I would recommend either not supporting div at all, or, alternatively, change your vector values to floating-point values (<code>double</code>).</p>

<p>I would also recommend that you change your model for vectors significantly, and instead of changing the current Vector with your arithmetic, that instead you return a new vector with the result:</p>

<pre><code>class Vector {
    final double x;
    final double y;

    public Vector(double x, double y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    public Vector add(Vector vector) {
        return new Vector(this.x + vector.x, this.y + v.y);
    }

    ....

}
</code></pre>

<p>Note how the x and y components of the vector are final, and the add returns a new vector.</p>

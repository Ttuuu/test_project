<p>Your color code is not portable. Instead, try using something like the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/termcolor/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>termcolor</code> package</a> which handles the complexity of colors for you. It seems like you've imported an initialized <code>colorama</code>, but aren't using that. That is a fine alternative. Just don't try doing it yourself (your <code>Color</code> enum)! With <code>termcolor</code> you can make help functions that abstract away color names:</p>

<pre><code>print_warning = lambda x: cprint(f'warning: {x}', 'yellow')

# Later in your code
print_warning('something went wrong')
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of:</p>

<pre><code>print('I', end='')
for dash in range(wrap):
    print('-', end='')
print('I', end='')
print()
</code></pre>

<p>Why not:</p>

<pre><code>print('I' + ('-' * wrap) + 'I')
</code></pre>

<p>Or you could pull it out into a variable to make it a bit cleaner:</p>

<pre><code>divider = '-' * wrap
print(f'I{divider}I')
</code></pre>

<p><code>tprint</code> is way too confusing for me to follow. Perhaps try breaking it into several methods instead of one method whose behavior changes drastically depending on the parameters provided.</p>

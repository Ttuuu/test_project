<p>You can use some built in functions instead of the for loops.</p>

<pre><code>var result = A2.filter(e =&gt; A1.includes(e.value));
</code></pre>

<p>I can't say if this is much faster, since those functions still loop through the arrays. You'll have to time this with some large input to test.</p>

<p>Be aware that Internet Explorer doesn't support <code>.includes</code> or arrow functions. IE friendly version:</p>

<pre><code>var result = A2.filter(function(e) {return A1.indexOf(e.value) !== -1});
</code></pre>
    </div>

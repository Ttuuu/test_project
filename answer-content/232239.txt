<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>This is how i have fixed the bug:</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>def create_random_ships():
    ship_coordinates = []

    while len(ship_coordinates) &lt; 3:
        ship = [random.randrange(5), random.randrange(5)]
        if ship not in ship_coordinates:
            ship_coordinates += [ship]

    return ship_coordinates
</code></pre>

<p>First, i have redefined the ship creation function like above.</p>

<p>Then,</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>        elif [row, column] in ship_coordinates:
            print("\nBoom! You hit! A ship has exploded! You were granted a new ammo!\n")
            game_board[row][column] = "X"
            ships_left -= 1
            if not ships_left:
                print("My my, i didn't know you were a sharpshooter! Congratz, you won!")
                break
</code></pre>

<p>I have changed the coordinate checking statement like above. Now, the bug is fixed and my code is much more improved compared to the previous code. Thank you all.</p>

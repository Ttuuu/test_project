<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>Since you're using python 3.7, I would take advantage of f-strings.
For example, this:</p>

<pre><code>return "That card hasn't been added to the game yet (" + card_to_add + ")."
</code></pre>

<p>Becomes:</p>

<pre><code>return f"That card hasn't been added to the game yet ({card_to_add})."
</code></pre>

<p>As others have said, avoid hardcoding magic numbers like 60, 3 etc.
Give these numbers meaningful names so that it is immediately obvious
what the numbers represent.</p>

<p>Also, unless I'm missing something critical, those monster classes are begging to use inheritance.</p>

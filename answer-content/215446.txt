<p>I actually only have a minor sidenote that might be interesting here. This code is clean and well-documented. I only have nitpicks (formatting, lack of braces) aside from the one thing that really "bothers" me.</p>

<p>As it stands, you're adding an additional entry-point to the heap, which <em>could</em> result in a memory leak. So long as you're only using this class in Debug-mode, that of course does not have very strong implications (especially if you use <code>reset</code> to clean the reference graph).</p>

<p>If you want to avoid this, you should look into using <code>WeakReference&lt;T&gt;</code> instead of keeping a direct reference to the object. Of course that implies you will need to deal with the object in <code>DebugVar</code> possibly being <code>null</code>. This doesn't really affect the code you currently have, though, since calling <code>add(null, "null");</code> does not result in any erroneous behaviour.</p>

<p>Storing the sum in <code>ShoppingCart</code> or computing it is up to you. I will compute it each time and eventually "cache" it if there is a lot of items.</p>

<p>However your code will be more maintainable by enforcing encapuslation and moving all this computation code in the <code>ShoppingCart</code> itself. You can also continue with encapsulation by adding a <code>getUnitPrice():double</code> and <code>getPrice()</code> in your <code>CartItem</code>.</p>

<p>Note that <code>double</code> is not a good type for money.</p>

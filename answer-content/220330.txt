<p>I don't think buffering is the problem or solution. Creating a gigantic buffer probably hurts if the recipient has, say, a 4k buffer for reading the results. That would mean the recipient can't start working before your code has finished completely, making the process completely serial instead of parallel. Instead you should try creating a smaller buffer (with the initial size defined in the constructor, so it doesn't do unnecessary reallocations) and flush it regularly. </p>

<p>This is usually good however this time you dispose too much. </p>

    Graphics graphic = e.Graphics;

    graphic.Dispose(); // Don't!    
}
</code></pre>

<p>You receive the <code>Graphics</code> object via the <code>PrintPageEventArgs</code>. This means that you should not dispose it. The owner takes care of the graphics object. You just use it for drawing. I wonder that this works at all because as soon as the graphics is disposed the <em>DocumentDrucker</em> has nothing to print. This should actually crash.</p>

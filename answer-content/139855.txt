<p><strong>Global Variables</strong><br>
Whether this is C or C++, global variables such as <code>arr[]</code> are always a bad idea. Global variables make writing and debugging code very difficult and allow for unintended side affects. The array arr should be defined in main and passed to all of the other functions.</p>

<p><strong>Using std::ANYTHING</strong><br>
You as a software engineer may in your career write your own <code>cin</code> and <code>cout</code>. To do this you would have to have your own namespace so that std::cin and std::cout did not break your code. Including the namespace in the symbolic identified identifies <em>which</em> symbol you are using. This allows you to write programs and libraries that have the most meaningful names.</p>

<p><strong>Use Container Classes</strong><br>
C++ has a great many container classes, some of which are <code>std::vector</code>, <code>std::array</code>, <code>std::queue</code> and <code>std::stack</code>. These container classes reduce the amount of code you need to write, and provide functionality such as the size of the array so that you don't have to write <code>sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0])</code>. It would be much simpler to use the containers provided by the Standard Template Library.</p>

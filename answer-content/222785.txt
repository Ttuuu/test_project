<p>I am not sure why you do not just use numpys ndarray and instead have invented your own version.
I would however suggest you make it derive from numpys ndarray, which will save you a lot of work, and it allow you to do all kinds of nice things with it. I would also use <code>__setitem__</code> instead of replace, so you can use the <code>grid[x,y] = value</code>, notation.
There are some problems with the padding of the start data. First off it has side effects (your input is actually changed), and secondly it will only work with actual lists, other numpy arrays and <code>Grid</code>s will fail. I recommend generating the grid first, and then slicing in the data when the input does not fit perfectly. Consider whether it would make sense to move setting the grid to have a certain value based on some data (possibly different types) to some other method.</p>

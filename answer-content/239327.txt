<p>You also have an operational problem as much as a code problem. Any tokens you use for a public demonstration should - </p>

<ol>
<li>Be as least-privileged as possible (eg grant READ access instead of CRUD or full admin)</li>
<li>Be tied to demo/test/dev environments where possible (I pray you are not doing code streaming in PROD)</li>
<li>Expired/rotated/destroyed frequently and aggressively (Terminate the token when your stream is done, set shorter timeouts so it expires for you)</li>
<li>Audited for improper use (check your logs and set alerts for unexpected use)</li>
<li>Access controlled in addition to the token where possible (whitelist IP, mutual TLS, etc). </li>
</ol>

<p>The code is an interesting exercise and the reviews will help. However what prevents some other debugging operation from exposing a token in a header or log or step-wise debugging operation? You can expose a token in a log or <code>tcpdump</code> just as easily as with <code>cat</code>.</p>

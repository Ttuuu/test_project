<p>Second approach is better, according to the rule: do not repeat the code!</p>

<p>Don't use '+=' to join string, in your case better to use StringBuilder:</p>

<pre><code>var sb = new StringBuilder();
sb.Append();
...
sb.Appden();
...
return sb.ToString();
</code></pre>

<p>I think this is better way, StringBuilder is made for this.
You can refactor this code better little more :-)</p>

<p>I would move the first conditional in main into a guard statement and lower the flow depth.</p>

<pre><code>if u_ip is None:
     print("You failed, terminating.\n")
     return
</code></pre>

<p>Also, if instead of incrementing a counter if you had a dictionary of port to open/closed mapping, you could have the option of doing more with it at the end of the run, such as outputting to a file, or returning it to another function as it grows. This would also work with an async model as the dictionary is a hash  and won't store a key more than once.</p>

<p>Other wise it looks solid. Nice work.</p>

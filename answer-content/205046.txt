<p>Ignoring a potential mathematical solution to your problem (the requirement that two adjacent entries in the combination adds a wrinkle), the biggest problem here is when you are scanning <code>path</code> for identical adjacent members.  You scan the entire array every time, counting the number of non-identical adjacent members.  What you really need to do is check for the presence of any matching adjacent members.  Set a flag when you find a match and break out of the loop, since once you find a match you know this combination is not good and you need to move on to the next one.</p>

<p>And be sure you have optimization turned on when you compile.</p>

<p>As mentioned in another answer, the best improvements to the code would be a function that is the equivelent of the C library function <code>strstr(char *hay_stack, char *needle)</code> and a function that replaces the string. This would simplify the <code>main()</code> function. One of the basic ways of writing a program is to keep breaking the problem down until the result is small functions that are easy to implement. The function <code>strstr()</code> can be written in less than 15 minutes, I know this because I used to use <code>implement strstr()</code> as an interview question.</p>

<p>This would also reduce the number of variables required in <code>main()</code> and you wouldn't need to worry about partial matches.</p>

<h2>Defining Symbolic Constants</h2>

<p>In the code <code>ARRAY_MAX</code> is defined using an enum, and it is not really clear why. In C++ this could be defined using</p>

<pre><code>int constexpr ARRAY_MAX = 50;
</code></pre>

<p>and in the C programming language </p>

<pre><code>int const ARRAY_MAX2 = 50;  // preferred method
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>#define ARRAY_MAX3  50  // Almost obsolete
</code></pre>

<p>It looks like what you're doing could be expressed thusly.</p>

<pre><code>import scala.util.Try

val levelMap = Map(...

Try(getAllByUserId(userId).maxBy(org =&gt; levelMap(org.level)).level).toOption
</code></pre>

<p>It's worth noting that this will also catch any exceptions thrown by <code>levelMap</code>. (Maybe a new level is encountered not yet included in <code>levelMap</code>.) That might or might not be considered a good thing.</p>

<p>You can unpack it some to avoid the <code>try</code>/<code>catch</code> overhead hidden inside the <code>Try</code> type.</p>

<pre><code>if (organizationMemberships.isEmpty)
  None
else
  Some(organizationMemberships.maxBy(om =&gt; levelMap(om.level)).level)
</code></pre>

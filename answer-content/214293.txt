<p>The method name <code>solve</code> does not describe what the method is doing. There should be a method <code>public static String longestCommonSubsequence(String a, String b)</code>, and the class containing that method should be called <code>StringUtils</code>.</p>

<p>After making the method <code>static</code>, there's no reason to call <code>new LongestSubsequence</code> any longer since that object doesn't provide anything useful.</p>

<p>The variable name <code>ch</code> is usually used for characters, not for strings. It creates unnecessary confusion here.</p>

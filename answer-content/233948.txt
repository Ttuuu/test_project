<p>The other feedback is quite good, so I just want to add a little tip about the section at the top:</p>

<pre><code>Application.ScreenUpdating = False
Application.Calculation = xlCalculationManual
Application.DisplayAlerts = False
</code></pre>

<p>While this is not really problematic for one routine, it is a good general idea to encapsulate these calls in their own routine in a regular module so that you save yourself hassle and unnecessary code duplication if/when you work on a more involved project. Just use a set of names corresponding with each state of the application that make sense to you or one name that makes sense with feeding a boolean or (other parameter like an Enum in the case you need multiple states).</p>

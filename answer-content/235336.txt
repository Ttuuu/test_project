<p>To make your code understandable, you should extract the code for merging a single <code>PersonDetail</code> into a separate function:</p>

<pre><code>fun merge(fresh: PersonDetail, fromDb: PersonDetail): PersonDetail {
}
</code></pre>

<p>This function is where the main complexity happens, and it should be easy to write unit tests for this part of the code. And you should definitely write unit tests, after all you're dealing with details of actual people here, so you better get it correct from the beginning.</p>

<p>In this <code>merge</code> function you can have much shorter variable names. Since you are dealing with persons only, you can remove the word <code>person</code> from the variable names, like I already did in the function declaration above. You can remove the word <code>detail</code> as well.</p>

<p>Thanks for all the replies. In the end it was relatively simple. My code is based on R, matrices start with 1 in R. Python, however, starts with 0. Adjusting my original code with this insight (sorry..) I am able to reproduce the output. I also included the remarks of Reinderien.</p>

<pre><code>import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def rps(predictions, observed):
   ncat = 3
   npred = len(predictions)
   rps = np.zeros(npred)

   for x in range(0, npred):
      obsvec = np.zeros(ncat)
      obsvec[observed.iloc[x]-1] = 1
      cumulative = 0
      for i in range(1, ncat):
         cumulative += (sum(predictions.iloc[x, 0:i]) - sum(obsvec[0:i])) ** 2
         rps[x] = cumulative / (ncat-1))

      return rps

df = pd.read_csv('test.csv', header=0)
predictions = df[['H', 'D', 'L']]
observed = df[['Outcome']]
rps = rps(predictions, observed)

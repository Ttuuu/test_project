<p>Among other things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Knowing the right-side chars has exactly one purpose: it tells you whether the number you're making (when palindromized) can be returned as is, or whether you have to find the "next" one.  So have a flag <code>needsBump</code> that starts out true.  Before you copy each char from the left side to the right, set the flag to <code>(left&lt;right || (needsBump &amp;&amp; left==right))</code>.  (<em>Don't</em> do any incrementing yet; do that separately once you've determined you need to.  Just copy chars.)  Once you've gotten to the middle, <code>needsBump</code> will indicate whether you need to bump the number up.  (The most significant digits to determine whether you need to bump are the middle ones.  If the left one is bigger than the right, then copying from left to right increases the number (making it unnecessary to bump).  If it's smaller, then copying will <em>decrease</em> the resulting number, making it necessary to bump -- however, even the smallest change to the least significant digit of the left side has more value than the entirety of the right side of the number.  If the left and right digits are equal, then the last decision made stands.) </p></li>
<li><p>Once you've determined you need to bump the number, you only have to start at the middle digit(s) and work your way out til you no longer have to carry.  If you're at the end of the number and still have to carry, prepend and append a '1'.</p></li>
<li><p>You're doing <em>way</em> too much parsing and stringifying.  <code>Integer.toString(...)</code>, <code>String.valueOf(...)</code>, etc create a new string each time -- which in <code>String.valueOf</code>'s case, you're just throwing away as soon as you parse.  You're talking about potentially millions of strings.  Stop trying to parse the numbers, and just work with them as chars.  You should see a pretty big speed boost.  </p>

<ul>
<li>StringBuffer and StringBuilder both have a <code>setCharAt</code> method, which you should be using (considering your "strings" always consist of a single char).</li>
<li><code>offset++; if (offset == 10) offset = 0;</code> becomes <code>if (++offset &gt; '9') offset = '0';</code>, for example.</li>
<li><code>Integer.parseInt(String.valueOf(theNumber.charAt(leftPos)))</code> becomes just <code>theNumber.charAt(leftPos)</code></li>
<li>You may be able to get rid of the string buffer/builder altogether and work with a regular old <code>char[]</code>.  All of your operations will be in terms of chars, and you shouldn't have any insertion to do in the general case -- except if K == 99...99, in which case you need to return 100...001.  But that's easy enough to do with <code>+</code> when you have to.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If you stick with string buffers, <code>StringBuilder</code> is generally faster, and should be preferred if you don't require synchronization (which you don't).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Style issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>Declaring every variable you'll ever use at the top of the function is a very Pascal way to do things.  Prefer declaring variables as close as possible to their first use.  It reduces scope, and along with that, decreases the number of things someone reading your code has to worry about at one time.</li>
</ul>

<p>The loop is a red herring; the important bit is how you're doing the conversion from one student-ish type to another. I'd start there by writing a converter method:</p>
<pre><code>private static StudentSystemRecordRequest ToRecordRequest(Student student)
{
    return new StudentSystemRecordRequest
    {
        FirstName = student.FirstName,
        LastName = student.SurName,
        DateOfBirth = student.DateOfBirth,
        Address = student.Address1
    };
}
</code></pre>
<p>I've chosen not to make this a member method of either of the <code>Student</code> types because I don't want to introduce any unnecessary coupling.</p>
<p>Such a method will compose well with LINQ, if you really want to get rid of the <code>foreach</code>:</p>
<pre><code>var studentInfo = result.Select(ToRecordRequest).ToList();
</code></pre>
    </div>

<p>I echo Reinderien's and Anonymous's comments re your <code>a, b, c, d</code>. I suggest renaming your <code>a</code> and <code>c</code> to <code>left</code> and <code>right</code>, and your <code>b</code> and <code>d</code> to <code>top</code> and <code>bottom</code>. (Two-word names such as <code>topleft</code> are not appropriate because each of these variables holds just one coordinate, not two.)</p>

<p>Then you needn't mandate which corner the user starts from. Let them start from any of the four corners. Then, after you have read x- and y-coordinates of two points given by the user, ensure they're the correct way round:</p>

<pre><code>    if top&lt;bottom:
        top, bottom = bottom, top
</code></pre>

<p>(and likewise for left and right). It's better to be generous than needlessly restrictive with ways you enable the user to do things. By contrast, your code needs to be strict about how it does things when that matters, e.g. correctly identifying which y-coor was the top and which one was the bottom.</p>

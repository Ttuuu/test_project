<p>the only change I would make is to remove your use of the <code>Dict</code>. Dicts are great when you need mutability, but here there is the much simpler solution <code>Int(letter)-Int('A')</code>. With this change, <code>namescore</code> becomes</p>

<pre><code>function namescore(name)
    return sum(Int(char)-Int('A') for letter in name[2:end-1])
end
</code></pre>

<p>This, however is not ideal, as we can take out the subtraction, yielding</p>

<pre><code>function namescore(name)
    return sum(Int(char) for letter in name[2:end-1]) - (lenth(name)-2) * Int('A')
end
</code></pre>

<p>I haven't done performance testing, but this should be a fair bit faster, as I would expect <code>Int</code> to be faster than a dictionary lookup.</p>

<p>On your previous version you commented, <em>"This works and gives the expected result for a series of test cases."</em> But you never provided those test cases, right? I think the biggest thing missing here is test cases. Especially since test cases would quickly clarify the expected behavior of the function on weird inputs, and then you could maybe even get rid of some of the vague comments like </p>

<pre><code>expects a vector with 2 integers, e.g. (1 1)
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>I infer that the two integers are supposed to be in the range 1..8 (not 0..7 as one might expect if one'd been doing too much programming lately and not enough chess). What happens when they're not in the range 1..8?</p></li>
<li><p>What happens when there are three integers in the vector, or one, or none?</p></li>
<li><p>What happens when there's something other than integers in the vector?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I know you split out <code>isInsideBoard</code> into its own named function thanks to a comment on the earlier question; but if it's only ever used once, is that buying you anything? Honestly, as not-really-an-APLer-myself, <code>∧/(1∘≤∧≤∘8)</code> is pretty much the only part of that code that I <em>could</em> instantly understand!</p>

<p>If I understand correctly, the output of <code>KnightMovesRevised</code> is a vector each of whose elements is suitable for feeding back into <code>KnightMovesRevised</code>; is that right? If so, that's good! You could even write a test case demonstrating how to find the number of cells that are exactly 2 knight-moves away from (1,1).</p>

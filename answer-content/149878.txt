<p>By PEP 8, <code>doesSeqAppear</code> should be <code>does_seq_appear</code>. You used the right naming convention for your unit tests, though. Personally, I would prefer <code>def contains_seq(arr, seq=[1, 3, 4])</code>.</p>

<p>Your <code>arr_len &lt; 3</code> test is superfluous and should therefore be eliminated. Don't write a special case when the regular case works correctly and just as quickly.</p>

<p>Your <code>all(isinstance(item, int) for item in int_arr)</code> check was not specified in the problem, and is therefore harmful. The question does not say that <code>doesSeqAppear([3.1, 1, 3, 4])</code> should return <code>False</code>, nor does it say that it should fail with an exception. In fact, by my interpretation, it does contain the magic sequence and should therefore return <code>True</code>. In any case, you have wasted a complete iteration of the list just to perform a check that wasn't asked for.</p>

<p>Checking <code>isinstance(int_arr, list)</code> is un-Pythonic, since <a href="/questions/tagged/duck-typing" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'duck-typing'" rel="tag">duck-typing</a> is the norm in Python. In any case, the code would likely fail naturally if it is not a list.</p>

<p>After cutting all that excess, you should drop the <code># Loop through elements</code> comment as well.</p>

<p>It seems to me your <code>rememberMe</code> function is doing too much, plus the naming of the function does not say much about what's going on inside.</p>

<p>I recently came across a <a href="https://github.com/gbirke/rememberme" rel="nofollow">nice library</a> for this functionality on PHP, which you can find on GitHub. It could surely give you good ideas on how to implement it and divide the code into classes.</p>

<p>Just one advice in case you prefer to continue on your own: separating DB logic from that function, extracting it on to a separate class that handles all kind of DB exceptions and queries. And yes, exception-handling is another point that you may consider important.</p>

<p>After looking back at it again, I realized I didn't need all those different <code>dataFiles</code>,
as all those <code>dataFiles</code> hold only a single reference with the full path to the XML file.</p>

<p>Instead I could get the path for each XML file and overwrite the single dataFile with the correct file path I want to execute.</p>

<ul>
<li>This makes adding another XML file to load, as easy as adding it to the directory I read the files from</li>
<li>And removes the need for multiple <code>dataFiles</code></li>
</ul>

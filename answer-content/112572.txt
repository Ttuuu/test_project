<p>In Python 3, <code>range</code> returns a sequence which is exactly what you made. In Python 2 however, <code>range</code> eagerly produces a list, which would cut your code into a single function, returning an integer list. (I dont know Java to show example code.) I am not saying you should make anything different, just pointing that out.</p>

<p>Also, I am not sure if incompatible type should result in returning false or an exception. Maybe you can provide some precedence for this behavior?</p>

<p>My guess is that the bottleneck is drawing random numbers at each iteration.</p>

<p>Why guess when you can measure? I changed the height to 100 so the whole thing takes me about 8 seconds, reasonable to play around with. Removing the <code>assert</code> line on the bottom makes it a bit faster. Also removing the <code>dirty = [j if...]</code> line makes it <strong>a lot</strong> faster. As you'd expect from that inefficient line.</p>
<p>Not sure why you're making it so complicated. I think <code>clean[idx] = 0</code> does the deletions you want, and it's fast.</p>

<p>Some suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Because of length and complexity alone I would say <strong>Bash is not a good fit for this purpose.</strong> A language like Python will be much better at validating strings, argument parsing, escaping SQL and especially error handling. Case in point:</li>
<li><p><strong>Your traps are clobbering each other.</strong> See this example:</p>

<pre><code>$ trap echo EXIT
$ trap ls EXIT
$ trap -p
trap -- 'ls' EXIT
</code></pre></li>
<li>".localhost" is not a domain - "localhost" is, and the dot is the <em>separator</em> between the hostname and domain.</li>
<li>The exit trap should be set up <em>before</em> creating the temporary directory, to avoid a race condition.</li>
<li><strong>Shell scripts should not be interactive</strong> unless absolutely required (such as <code>top</code> or <code>vim</code>). Instead of asking the user to install some software I would make Zenity an optional dependency of this script, and possibly warn the user about it being missing if necessary. This will shorten and simplify your script considerably.</li>
<li><strong>Shell scripts should not run <code>sudo</code></strong> (or equivalent). Privilege escalation should <em>always</em> be at the discretion of the user, so the script should simply fail with a useful message if it can't do what it needs to because of missing privileges.</li>
<li><code>notify_user</code> could just as well <code>echo "$@"</code> to support any number of arguments, or could also include useful information such as the time of the message if you use <code>printf</code> instead.</li>
<li>A more <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/10383546/96588">portable shebang line</a> is <code>#!/usr/bin/env bash</code>.</li>
<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/669486/96588">Use <code>[[</code> rather than <code>[</code></a>.</li>
<li>Run the script through <code>shellcheck</code> to get more linting tips.</li>
</ul>

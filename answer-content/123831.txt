<h3>Flaw with aces</h3>
<p>Currently, your program forces you to decide what to do with an ace as soon as it is dealt.  So for example, if you were dealt <code>A 3</code>, you might decide to treat the ace as an 11 and have a total count of 14.  But if you hit and get a <code>10</code>, your program would consider that a bust.  In real blackjack, if you had <code>A 3 10</code>, you would actually only be at a 14 count still.</p>
<p>To fix this, you need to track whether the hand has any aces, and always treat the aces as value 1.  Then at the last moment, when you are evaluating the hand for point count, you can attempt to add back 10 if possible.</p>

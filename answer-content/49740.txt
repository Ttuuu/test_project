<li><p>Comments should not state the obvious:</p>

<pre><code>/*initializes c and inspace. */
int c;
int inspace;

/*sets inspace = 0*/
inspace = 0;
</code></pre>

<p>The first comment is also misleading because both variables are being <em>declared</em> (no initial value set), not initialized (initial value set).  Comments are supposed to stay in sync with code, and misleading comments do detract from that.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there's no need to declare and then assign to <code>inspace</code>.  Initializing right away will also help keep variables in closer scope, which is encouraged.</p>

<pre><code>int inspace = 0;
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Prefer to use <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/byte/isspace" rel="noreferrer"><code>isspace()</code></a> to check if a character is a space.  Since you're checking if a character is <em>not</em> a space, use it with <code>!</code>.</p>

<pre><code>if (!isspace(c))
</code></pre></li>

<p>I like it.  Coding is easy to read.  In particular, here are the positives:</p>

<ul>
<li>Nice style and indentation</li>
<li>Nice variable naming</li>
<li>I like <code>public</code> and <code>private</code> declarations to each method.</li>
</ul>

<p>The biggest area of contention is a matter of personal style, and that would be whether to always use braces after an <code>if</code> or <code>foreach</code>.  The general consensus here at CR is that you should use them, but there is a significant number of developers who do not.</p>

<p>Getting pickier, <code>RebaseIsDigitsEmptyOrZero</code> and <code>RebaseSolution</code> should maybe be marked <code>private</code>.  When you call them in <code>Rebase</code>, you have already validated all arguments.  If it is <code>public</code>, I could call <code>RebaseIsDigitsEmptyOrZero</code> directly and either pass in a null <code>digits</code> or <code>{ -1, 1 }</code>.  The former would throw an exception but the latter would return <code>true</code>.</p>

<p>For a future challenge, if you dare, I was thinking of a class or struct that contains <code>Digits</code> and <code>Base</code> as properties that are co-joined in that class/struct.  Then you could have a <code>ConvertBase</code> method accepting the new base as the argument, and it would return a new instance of that class/struct with the appropriate <code>Digits</code> and <code>Base</code>.  Dunno.  Still thinking about that one, but it might be worth exploring.</p>

<p>Nice job.  I look forward to your future CR questions.</p>

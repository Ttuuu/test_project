<p>Some suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rather than explaining parameters in comments, simply name the variables so that the comments become unnecessary. A signature of <code>def format_uncertain_values(names, values, uncertainties, significant_digits=2, format='pm', word_separated=False)</code> should do it.</li>
<li>There are three distinct sections to your method, which should probably be separate methods.</li>
<li>This code is a great candidate for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">type hints</a>. Declare types using for example <code>names: typing.List[str]</code> and validate them using the <code>mypy</code> command line tool (be sure to look into the MyPy options, because the default configuration is very lax). This will highlight at least one implementation issue: <code>ws</code> is treated as <em>either</em> a boolean or a string, but

<ul>
<li>boolean arguments are a code smell (<a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/q/147977/13162">1</a>, <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/q/323554/13162">2</a>) and</li>
<li>making it a string (possibly defaulting it to the empty string) would remove the need for the <code>ws = ' ' if â€¦</code> line.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The code would be much simpler if it simply took a <em>single</em> name, value and uncertainty. Then the user

<ul>
<li>avoids having to wrap everything in lists to format a single variable and</li>
<li>can still trivially loop over their values to print all of them.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Send the code through at least one linter such as <code>flake8</code> or <code>pycodestyle</code> until it passes all the tests. Then your code will be much more idiomatic, and therefore easier to read and maintain for people familiar with Python.</li>
<li>Default arguments are IMO a code smell. They should only really be used if it is completely obvious what the default is, even for someone who only reads the body of the method.</li>
<li>The format names are magic strings, and as such should be either constants or enums.</li>
<li>The format synonyms such as <code>['fancy', 'pms']</code> feel like over-engineering. If you're the only user for now, why make your code more complicated than it needs to be?</li>
<li>The method should <code>return</code> rather than <code>print()</code> the result (see above about handling only a single variable at a time) so that it can be <em>reused</em> by other code. It would be trivial to add a wrapper like <code>def main()</code> to <code>print()</code> it.</li>
</ul>

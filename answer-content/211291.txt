<p>As long as all the rows in your working sheet have a valid identifier, you can simplify this process a <strong>lot</strong> by looking at each row and looking up the Sheet you're supposed to copy the row to.</p>

<p>This allows you to write a <strong>single</strong> loop instead of a loop for each ID there is:</p>

<pre><code>Dim source As Worksheet
Dim target As Worksheet
Dim targetRow As Long

Set source = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets("Working Sheet")
' As long as there is a row to cut and paste
Do While source.Cells("A2").Value &lt;&gt; vbNullString
  ' select where the row is supposed to go
  Set target = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets(source.Cells("A2").Value)
  targetRow = target.Cells(target.Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row + 1
  ' and transfer it using copy &amp; delete
  With source.Range("A2").EntireRow
    .Copy target.Range("A" &amp; targetRow)
    .Delete xlShiftUp
  End With
Loop
</code></pre>

<p>Of course if that's not the case, this simplification still applies: Iterate the rows of the worksheet <strong>once</strong> and only Copy&amp;Delete the rows where the identifier matches one of the allowed identifiers.</p>

<p>If deleting the rows from the working sheet is not correct, or you don't want to move every row, you will need to iterate using a For Loop.</p>

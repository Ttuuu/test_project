<p>A few pieces of feedback:</p>

<ul>
<li>Semi-colons in Python aren't necessary, unless you're trying to issue two commands on one line like <code>a=5;b=6</code>.  I couldn't find a pep style guide that specifically bans them, but most Python code doesn't use them, as they are unnecessary.</li>
<li>You set <code>temp_key</code> to a <code>str</code>, but that is unnecessary.  I'm assuming you added that because you probably had it as a list before and got a "unhashable" error when trying to use a list as a dictionary key.  This is a perfect spot to use a tuple, and your code will work if you just remove the <code>str</code> (leaving the <code>()</code>), because tuples are hashable and immutable.</li>
<li>Instead of relying on floating point accuracy, which isn't a problem given the magnitude of your examples, an alternative would be to use the fractions class and all your calculations would be exact.</li>
<li>Instead of recursively calling the comp function for your inverse negative and inverse divide, it'd probably be much simpler to just write <code>tmp = nums[j]-nums[i]</code>.  I'd suggest it for the inverse divides too.</li>
</ul>

<p>Is it necessary to be <code>int</code>s ? well as i see it , and it may be too complicated for your program you can make a dictionary table, and use it.</p>

<pre><code>monthDict= {
  1: "january",
  2: "february",
  #etc
}

# and then just use
month = montDict(integerRepresentationOfMont)
# and you can do that for year, month, day etc and format it accordingly with strings manipulation.
</code></pre>

<p>As i understood from colleagues above, you are either using long way outdated version of python ( which i find unlikely as when you download python IDE it offers you a newest version ) or you are a novice or you are trying to figure out how <code>str.format</code> is done.</p>

<p>So lets assume you are novice. You can format integers in python as string ,rerp, hex,oct,bin etc etc with <code>str.format</code> as colleague above said.</p>

<p>String formating can be done in several ways:</p>

<pre><code>#string concatination
somestirng = "somestring"+ str(someinteger)

#string joining, use some string to join some other string = somestring.join(someotherstirng) ofcorse "" is valid string
somestirng = "-".join(listofItems) # if listofItems = [1,2,3] result would be 1-2-3

#formating
somestirng = "{0:02}".format(integer)

#or using % sign
a = "somestring %s" %( 4)
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see there are to many ways you can use and mess up string, the way you use it is mostly defined by your preferences and program requirement.</p>

<p>Using an dictionary to switch between values:
Part of the solution i have given to you above, but using string manipulation shown just now, we can spice the dictionary with some formating.
<strong>research lambda functions</strong> or you can just put normal functions as value in dictionary</p>

<p>If you know your way inside python programming language, and you are trying to figure out how to do <code>str.format</code> on your own you can see this link for <a href="https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/2.7/Lib/string.py" rel="nofollow noreferrer"> source code</a></p>

<p>Lets see what we have as normal startup tools, we have use of <code>chr</code> or <code>ord</code> as characters and integers that can represent characters, and most of <code>built_in</code> data types have str method that can convert the output value to string. </p>

<p>If program doesn't need complex binary/hex/oct/int conversion and searching for characters, we can just convert it to string and concatenate it to another string.
I could reproduce <code>class Format</code> from source code, as for that we have THE SOURCE CODE, i could reproduce the requested formating for datetime string.</p>

<pre><code>def mineDate(dateTuple):
    year,month,day = dateTuple # you should format dateTuple as (year,month,day)
    # result for (2000,12,4) 12/4/2000
    return "{0:02}/{1:02}/{2:04}".format(month,day,year)
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to change months from integer to names or abbreviations you can use dictionary for that and some other  </p>

<p>This should work for your case. For further research google <strong>string formating</strong> or <strong>string concatenation</strong> </p>

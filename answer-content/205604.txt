<p>The only option to have this really fast is to use primitive types, which in turn requires to write "non-generic" (specialised for every primitive type) function (piece of code) for every primitive type that you would like to use. By "non-generic" here I mean code that use specialised types only, without promotion. There is no other option. Conversion from primitives to Object just take time, you can save it using non-generic function. </p>

<p><code>Array.set()</code> is generic because it takes Object as an input, thats why it promotes every primitive to Object.</p>

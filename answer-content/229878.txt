<p>Why would you use <code>stackexchange.com</code> and only take ones with the title of <code>stackoverflow.com</code>? That's a huge waste. </p>

<p>You could change your url from <code>https://stackexchange.com/questions?tab=realtime</code> to <code>https://stackoverflow.com/questions?tab=realtime</code>.</p>

<p>However, actually visiting the website the way you are is hacky and overkill. Instead of web scraping, use the <a href="https://api.stackexchange.com/docs">Stackexchange API</a>.</p>

<p>There is no way to get a notification when a new question is posted. You will have to make a call every time you want the latest results.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> there may be a way to get notifications, see <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/229875/get-a-notification-when-questions-get-posted/229878#comments-229878">vogel612's comment</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>there is websockets to receive notifications when a new question is
  posted. To my knowledge these are very much undocumented and easier to
  get access to with a userscript (which would imply changing to
  javascript), but it's not like there's no way to receive notifications
  from SE directly.</p>

<p>This is mostly fine but there is a lot of repetition as well and it is not broken up very well.  Remember that haskell is lazy so none of the operations in the where clauses will be executed unless they are needed, so it is safe to just set them up.  Keep in mind I went to the extreme and made a where clause for everything but you can keep it more sensible if you want.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/list-comprehensions-in-python" rel="nofollow noreferrer">List comprehensions</a> are very well-suited for this task. The basic syntax is the following:</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>new_list = [ expression(x) for x in old_list if condition(x) ]
</code></pre>

<p>In this case we don't want to change the list elements, simply select them according to a condition. What should be this condition? Well, Python also provides a simple syntax to check if a string (or a list) contains an element, with the keyword <code>in</code>,or <code>not in</code> for the negation (this is the same keyword used for iterationg through a list, so be careful to not get confused).</p>

<p>With these tools, your code can fit on two lines, with no import required:</p>

<pre><code>a_city = [ city for city in cities if "a" in city ]
no_a_city = [ city for city in cities if "a" not in city ]
</code></pre>
    </div>

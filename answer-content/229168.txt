<p>I see two race conditions.</p>

<ol>
<li>When you write the file, two processes may write it at the same time and one entry will be lost.</li>
<li>Between reading the user list and adding a new user, i.e. in the time when the user chooses a password, another process could add the same user, so the user is added twice even when you checked that the user is not in the list when reading the file before.</li>
</ol>

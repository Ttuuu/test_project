<p>Your code is indeed not idiomatic Haskell. It's not at all clear at first glance how the code works, while something simple is going on.</p>

<p>The correct patten usage:</p>

<pre><code>isLeapYear :: Integer -&gt; Bool
isLeapYear year
  | isDivisibleBy 400 = True
  | isDivisibleBy 100 = False
  | isDivisibleBy 4 = True
  | otherwise = False
  where isDivisibleBy d = year `mod` d == 0
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how it becomes obvious at first glance what's happening in the function.</p>

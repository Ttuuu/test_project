<p>I am just going to step through this so that it is a little easier to understand for someone happening upon this question in the future.</p>

<p>This is what we are starting with</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>WHERE
  ( (@Max IS NULL OR @Type &lt;&gt; 'Products')
      OR (@Max IS NOT NULL AND @Type = 'Products'
          AND ProductCount &gt;  @Max ) )

  AND ( (@Min IS NULL OR @Type &lt;&gt; 'Products')
      OR (@Min IS NOT NULL AND @Type = 'Products'
          AND ProductCount &lt;  @Min ) )

  AND ( (@Max IS NULL OR @Type &lt;&gt; 'Vendors')
      OR (@Max IS NOT NULL AND @Type = 'Vendors'
          AND VendorCount &gt;  @Max ) )

  AND ( (@Min IS NULL OR @Type &lt;&gt; 'Vendors' )
      OR (@Min IS NOT NULL AND @Type = 'Vendors'
          AND VendorCount &lt;  @Min ) )

  AND ( (@Max IS NULL OR @Type &lt;&gt; 'Order')
      OR (@Max IS NOT NULL AND @Type = 'Order'
          AND OrderCount &gt;  @Max ) )

  AND ( (@Min IS NULL OR @Type &lt;&gt; 'Order')
      OR (@Min IS NOT NULL AND @Type = 'Order'
          AND OrderCount &lt;  @Min ) )
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>I am going to first take out all the <code>&lt;&gt;</code> conditions because we are already checking in the or statements for <code>@Type = {type}</code> and I am going to take out the check for <code>@Max IS NOT NULL</code> because if it were <code>NULL</code> we wouldn't hit that condition anyway.</p>

<pre><code>WHERE
    ( @Max IS NULL
        OR (@Type = 'Products'
            AND ProductCount &gt;  @Max ) )

    AND ( @Min IS NULL 
        OR (@Type = 'Products'
            AND ProductCount &lt;  @Min ) )

    AND ( @Max IS NULL
        OR (@Type = 'Vendors'
            AND VendorCount &gt;  @Max ) )

    AND ( @Min IS NULL 
        OR (@Type = 'Vendors'
            AND VendorCount &lt;  @Min ) )

    AND ( @Max IS NULL
        OR (@Type = 'Order'
            AND OrderCount &gt;  @Max ) )

    AND ( @Min IS NULL
        OR (@Type = 'Order'
            AND OrderCount &lt;  @Min ) )
</code></pre>

<p>Way cleaner already.</p>

<p>now we have <code>@Max IS NULL</code> and <code>@Min IS NULL</code> checks that we could combine so we aren't repeating ourselves.</p>

<pre><code>WHERE
(
    @Max IS NULL 
    OR
    (@Type = 'Products' AND ProductCount &gt;  @Max)
    OR 
    (@Type = 'Vendor' AND VendorCount &gt; @Max)
    OR
    (@Type = 'Order' AND OrderCount &gt; @Max)
)
AND
(
    @Min IS NULL
    OR
    (@Type = 'Products' AND ProductCount &lt; @Min)
    OR 
    (@Type = 'Vendor' AND VendorCount &lt; @Min)
    OR
    (@Type = 'Order' AND OrderCount &lt; @Min)
)
</code></pre>

<p>This is the Final Solution that @Peter Lang came to.  I use Parenthesis to make sure that the where clause is being interpreted by the RDBMS the way that I want them interpreted, if they aren't interpreted the way I think they will be it can lead to weird results that sometimes are hard to spot.</p>

<p>Always double check your returned data to make sure you are getting what you want. </p>

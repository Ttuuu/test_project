<p>One criticism I will give you is I think you went overboard with the comments. Some of the code will speak for itself if it's well written. Not saying my code is well written, I'm just saying.</p>

<p>Here's what I came up with. I'm afraid it's not much cleaner than your version, if at all. I spent a good amount of time on it too.</p>

<pre><code>function mergePortRanges(input){

    //Group all ranges into one array
    let portList = [];
    input.forEach( list =&gt; {
        portList.push(...list.split(',').map( range =&gt; range.trim()));
    });

    //Break the ranges into objects with min max integers
    portList = portList.map( range =&gt; {
        range = range.split('-').map( s =&gt; +s );
        if(range.length === 1)
            range.push(range[0]);
        return { min: range[0], max: range[1] };
    });

    //Sort by mins
    portList.sort((a,b) =&gt; (a.min &gt; b.min) ? 1 : -1);

    //Group ranges starting with same min and grab the highest one.
    let newPortList = [];
    let curRangeMin = 0;
    for(let x = 0; x &lt; portList.length; x++){
        let range = portList[x];

        if(curRangeMin === range.min) continue;
        else curRangeMin = range.min;

        let group = portList.filter( old =&gt; range.min == old.min); //Get full range
        group.map( (a,b) =&gt; (a.max &gt; b.max) ? 1 : -1 ); //Sort by max
        newPortList.push( group[0] ); //Grab highest in range and push.
    }

    return newPortList.map( range =&gt; {
        if(range.min == range.max)
            return range.min;
        else
            return `${range.min}-${range.max}`;
    }).join(',');
}
</code></pre>

<p>I still feel like this could be refined quite a bit, but I've already spent so much time on it lol. Maybe I'll try again when I'm smarter.</p>

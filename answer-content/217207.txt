<p>Instead of using a single regular expression, you should keep a separate expression for each kind of token you want to match.</p>

<p>What about these string literals?</p>

<pre><code>""
"\n"
"\\"
"\\\\\\\\"
"{$arr['key']-&gt;["value"]}"
</code></pre>

<p>Some further questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Does PHP have literals for regular expressions?</li>
<li>Are there other tokens that look like strings?</li>
<li>Are you the first person in the world who wants to split PHP code into separate tokens?</li>
<li>What about multiline string literals?</li>
<li>What about <code>?&gt; these &lt;?php</code> string literals?</li>
</ul>

<p>Since the answer to the third question is a clear No, just use an existing library.</p>

<p>My advice is to keep the regular expressions as small as possible. Otherwise your code will become unreadable in the future.</p>

<p>Another option is to do away with the extra classes since each book has the information needed.  A nested <code>groupby</code> query will give you the exact groupings that you want:</p>

<pre><code>var libraryGroups = (from Book b in table
               group b by b.LibraryId into libraries
               from shelves in
               (from b in libraries
                group b by b.ShelveId into shelves
                select shelves)
               group shelves by libraries.Key);
</code></pre>

<p>To print out all the data 3 nested loops will be needed:</p>

<pre><code>foreach(var library in libraryGroups)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Library Name = {library.First().First().LibraryName}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Shelf Count = {library.Count()}");
    var totalCost = 0;
    foreach(var shelf in library)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Shelf Name = {shelf.First().ShelveName}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Book Count = {shelf.Count()}");
        foreach(var book in shelf)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(book.Name);
        }
        int shelfCost = shelf.Sum(x =&gt; x.Cost);
        Console.WriteLine($"Shelf Cost = {shelfCost}\n");
        totalCost += shelfCost;              
    }
    Console.WriteLine($"Library Cost = {totalCost}\n");
}
</code></pre>

<p>To print a subset of the data adjust which loops are used.</p>

<p>Once your main query has been made, you can filter and or aggregate the result however is needed.</p>

<p>the print out for this looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>Library Name = Green
Shelf Count = 2
Shelf Name = A
Book Count = 1
Gra
Shelf Cost = 10

Shelf Name = B
Book Count = 1
Grb
Shelf Cost = 21

Library Cost = 31

Library Name = Blue
Shelf Count = 2
Shelf Name = C
Book Count = 2
Blc
Bl2
Shelf Cost = 11

Shelf Name = D
Book Count = 1
Bld
Shelf Cost = 12

Library Cost = 23

Library Name = White
Shelf Count = 1
Shelf Name = E
Book Count = 1
Foo
Shelf Cost = 14

Library Cost = 14

Library Name = Grey
Shelf Count = 1
Shelf Name = F
Book Count = 2
Foo
Bar
Shelf Cost = 23

Library Cost = 23

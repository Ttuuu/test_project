<p>Couple of other comments:</p>

<p>1) How are you handling negative numbers?</p>

<p>2) Since the numbers per digit stored is in the range 0-9 does it require to be an int type? Why it can't be unsigned char type?</p>

<p>Considering above this is my suggestion for the bigint struct (assuming c99 standard):</p>

<pre><code>struct bigint {
    bool negative;
    size_t num_digits;
    unsigned char *digits;
};
</code></pre>
    </div>

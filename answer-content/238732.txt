<p>You misspelled "movement" as "movment".</p>

<p>Typically (as per <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP-8</a>), indentations are specified by one hard tab or four spaces, so you're good in that respect.</p>

<p>To be sure about formatting you can read up on PEP-8.</p>

<p>I am also wondering about <code>_man</code>. This doesn't seem to be displaying a man (but I haven't run it) so why name it that way? Also, <code>epilepsy</code> doesn't seem like a suitable name. Perhaps <code>colored_box</code> would be more formal?</p>

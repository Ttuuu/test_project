<ul>
<li>You are recreating TimeUnit.convert(long, TimeUnit) in your UnitConverter. Or, keeping with single responsiblity principle, I don't really see why a
stopwatch should be able to do unit conversion.</li>
<li>Elapsed time is always forced to double primitive type even if the user wants nothing but nanoseconds. See above.</li>
<li>Rounding and formatting in toString should be done with DecimalFormat and RoundingMode (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/153724/how-to-round-a-number-to-n-decimal-places-in-java">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/153724/how-to-round-a-number-to-n-decimal-places-in-java</a>). But in the end toString is a debugging method, which should output the exact state of the object and it shouldn't convert types or round values at all. See above.</li>
<li>Decide between static initializer methods and public constructors. Having both types of initializers is confusing.</li>
<li>Because primitive types can't convey the information, you should add the unit specifier to the names of your private members. E.g. elapsedNanos.</li>
</ul>

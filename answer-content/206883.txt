<h3>The answer</h3>

<p>What you're actually trying to do is only converting objects from Javascript notation to actual javascript objects. Now what if there was a well-specified data interchange format that was named "Javascript object notation"? Oh there is?</p>

<pre><code>parsed = JSON.parse(inputField.value);
</code></pre>

<p>You're even using <code>JSON.stringify</code> already...</p>

<h3>Other general advice</h3>

<ul>
<li>Don't use classes to identify unique elements. That's exactly not what classes are intended for. Instead use IDs.</li>
<li>Make use of the strict evaluation mode for javascript... <code>"use strict";</code> </li>
<li>You could avoid the <code>e.preventDefault</code> if you didn't use a submit button, but a normal button instead or listened to <code>'onblur'</code>. I personally would prefer the last method the most, possibly combined with an <code>'onchange'</code> listener with a timeout.</li>
<li>Always put braces around your stuffs, in this case around the <code>throw new Error</code>. This helps avoid bugs when changing the code later.</li>
</ul>

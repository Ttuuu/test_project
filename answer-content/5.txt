<p>From your question I infer that you're thinking of having several instances of the DB class.  If so I'd suggest abstracting the connection out to another class and holding a reference to the same connection in each DB instance.</p>

<p>You could then set your connection up as a singleton and thus only connect &amp; disconnect once.</p>

<p>Apologies in advance if I've missed anything here - my PHP is far from fluent.</p>

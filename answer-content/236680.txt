<p><strong>A linter doesn't check that the code <em>works,</em> it checks that the code follows some specific formatting guidelines.</strong> Neither is more <em>correct,</em> but there is community consensus that <em>in general,</em> following the PEP8 standard makes Python code easier to read for humans.</p>

<p>It is completely possible that the online linter, which you haven't referenced or named, <em>contradicts</em> PEP8 in some way, in which case I would instead try using one of the well-maintained linters like <a href="https://pypi.org/project/flake8/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">flake8</a>. Or make your life even simpler and use <a href="https://github.com/python/black" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Black</a> to automatically <em>format</em> your code and get most of PEP8 for free.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>line break before binary operator</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Means just that: the linter considers it a problem that there is a line break (aka. newline) just before a binary operator (in this case, presumably <code>+</code>, although I didn't expect that to be considered a <em>binary</em> operator in a string context). Try moving the <code>+</code> operators from the start to the end of the previous line.</p>

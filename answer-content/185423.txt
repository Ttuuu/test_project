<p>You wrote a bullet list so I try to comment each bullet separately</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I have mixed sentiment about this. I do agree with  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/77361/3729797">this</a> stack overflow post, I'll quote </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An exception is thrown when a fundamental assumption of the current code block is found to be false.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here you want to validate a Json schema, so your code validate it or not, but if the parameter for JsonSchema is <code>null</code> it goes contrary to what is expected so I believe you are right to throw the exception.</p>

<p>But for the same reason, I believe you should not return an exception when <code>processingReport.isSuccess()</code> returns false. My take on this would be to return <code>true</code> of <code>false</code> to indicate if validation is ok or not. That might have to do with personal taste. </p></li>
<li><p>I like it the same way, but sometimes it's good to throw an exception as soon as you can. Here I it doesn't really matter, your code is readable and understandable, do as you please.</p></li>
<li><p>I see nothing wrong with the fact that if <code>json</code> is <code>null</code> you don't check for <code>jsonSchema</code>. The only thing maybe I would be wary of is because you don't return a value, you consider <code>json == null</code> the same as a valid <code>json</code>, which might be a bit confusing. </p></li>

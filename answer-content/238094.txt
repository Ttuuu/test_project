<p>You do not provide a testable function that performs the task of returning the desired answer for a specific test case. It is the 'normal number' handling that you intermangled with your test code. The main structure of your program structure should look somewhat like</p>

<pre><code>def fizzbuzz(int):
    #[...]
    return answer

for num in range(1, 101):
    print(fizzbuzz(num))
</code></pre>

<p>You are free to do helper functions but you should always provide a complete testable solution.
Completely separate the functionality you want to provide from the tests. even split into different files.</p>

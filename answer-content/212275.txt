<p>There are a couple questionable things here, first since <code>ALLOC()</code> is a macro you don't need to pass the address of <code>p</code>. If <code>ALLOC()</code> were a function call then you would want to pass the address of <code>p</code>.</p>

<p>Second, for an array I would probably use <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/memory/calloc" rel="nofollow noreferrer">calloc()</a> rather than malloc().</p>

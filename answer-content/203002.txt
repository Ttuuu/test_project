<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>I think this would be the cleanest solution. Similar to @YourCommonSense answer, but slightly inverted as ordered index is already there - only values missing.</p>

<pre><code>$sorted = array_flip($order);
foreach ($array as $value) {
    $id = $value['id'];
    $sorted[$id] = $value;
}
</code></pre>
    </div>

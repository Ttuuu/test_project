<p>Thanks, @Xaqq, this is really nice!</p>

<p>I published the code in <a href="https://github.com/mrts/flag-set-cpp" rel="nofollow noreferrer">GitHub</a> with amendments from @Barry and @lightness-races-in-orbit and minor modifications, usage is as follows:</p>

<pre class="lang-cpp prettyprint-override"><code>#include "flag_set.hpp"

enum class Options : uint8_t {
    FULLSCREEN,
    INVERT_MOUSE,
    FLASH,
    RED_BACKGROUND,
    RED_FOREGROUND,
    _
};

int main()
{
    flag_set&lt;Options&gt; red(Options::RED_FOREGROUND | Options::RED_BACKGROUND);

    if (red &amp; Options::RED_BACKGROUND)
        cout &lt;&lt; "Red background activated";
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I chose <code>_</code> as sentinel as it stands out clearly and is unlikely to collide with a real enum value. Also, I felt that it is natural to follow the ISO standard library underscore style naming as this is a general utility class similar to standard library classes.</p>

<p>Please feel free to file further amendments as issues in the GitHub repository. @Xaqq, if you want to, I can yield the repository to you as you are the rightful author. </p>

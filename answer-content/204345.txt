<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>I would simulate the enum using class constants.</p>

<pre><code>class VoucherType {
  const INVOICE = 0;
  const CREDIT_NOTE = 1;
  const ADVANCE = 2;
}

$myType = VoucherType::INVOICE;
</code></pre>

<p>They are accesible from everywhere you can access the class, virtually everywhere if you use (and you should) an autoloader.</p>

<p>This is a readable and well-known pattern but there are more sophisticated options, starting with <a href="https://secure.php.net/manual/en/class.splenum.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">SplEnum</a> and ending with <a href="https://github.com/vijinho/php7-enums" rel="nofollow noreferrer">php7-enum</a>, but I like the simplicity of the constants. </p>

<p>Also I you are new to PHP I recommend you to read other's code to learn and get used to the language.</p>

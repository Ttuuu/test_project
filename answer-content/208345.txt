<p>It looks like your are doing it mostly right.   You have problems with length zero and length 1 arrays, but you should be able to fix those pretty quick. </p>

<p>You may be doing more work than necessary.  If an array is not sorted, you might find <code>leftPart</code> is <code>false</code>, but you unconditionally go on to determine the value of <code>rightPart</code> anyway, despite it not mattering.  The simplest way to avoid that is to combine that recursive calls and the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> operation.  Ie:</p>

<pre><code>return isSorted(arr, start, middle) &amp;&amp; isSorted(arr, middle, end);
</code></pre>

<p>Lastly, if the array contains duplicates, can it still be considered sorted?  You return <code>false</code> for <code>[1, 2, 2, 3]</code>.</p>

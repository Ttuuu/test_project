<p>From a short review:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I would follow the <em>method</em> names provided at <code>https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map</code> they are both shorter and more intuitive. Your method names are too long</p></li>
<li><p>More particularly, I would change the name of 'getValues<code>to</code>clone`</p></li>
<li><p>I would have the set/get/delete method return the Dictionary object for chained calls, if set/get is called on a <code>ownProperty</code>, I would throw an exception.</p></li>
</ul>

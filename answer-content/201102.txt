<p><code>find</code> is good for finding files and directories recursively in a filesystem tree.
Based on your description and example, you probably don't need that.
If you want to check that some directory <code>foo</code> exists directly under <code>/some/path</code>,
it's much simpler and more efficient to use the <code>test</code> or <code>[</code> builtin.</p>

<p>There are some other minor issues in the posted code:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It's a good practice (and often necessary) to double-quote variables in command parameters. For example instead of <code>rm -rf ${dir%*/}</code> write <code>rm -rf "${dir%*/}"</code></p></li>
<li><p>Instead of writing <code>${dir%*/}</code> 3 times, it would be better to store in a variable. In fact you did store the result of the first "call" in a variable, and since subsequent calls on the modified value will be the same, you could have used <code>$dir</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>I think <code>dir=${dir%/}</code> is equivalent to <code>dir=${dir%*/}</code> but simpler.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Putting the above together, a cleaner, more efficient alternative:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash

for dir in ./Peter/*/*/
do
    dir=${dir%/}
    name=${dir##*/}
    if ! [ -d "./Eva/animals/$name" ]
    then
        echo "$dir not found and deleted"
        rm -rf "$dir"
    fi
done
</code></pre>

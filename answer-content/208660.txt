<p>Don't do this. Just say <code>score = 0</code>.</p>

<p><code>Quesions</code> - run your UI text through spell check.</p>

<p>Why are you calling <code>sleep()</code>? These calls are not really conducive to a useful user interface. If it's a matter of interacting with the user in a manner that waits to prepare them for the next question, there are better ways to do this - press any key to continue, or if the application calls for it, a countdown timer display. But blindly <code>sleep()</code>ing is generally not a good idea.</p>

<p><code>score = score + 1</code></p>

<p>Don't do this. Just do <code>score += 1</code></p>

<p>In two places you write <code>(score)</code>. These parens don't do anything and should be dropped. Similarly, there's no need for double-parens around <code>((num1 / num2 * 100))</code>.</p>

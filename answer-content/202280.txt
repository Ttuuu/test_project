<p>Your code is inefficient. The 3 sample test cases your code passes have small inputs. The actual tests typically have larger inputs.</p>

<p><code>array_shift</code> function needs to re-index the entire array every time you use it. Suppose an array has \$10^5\$ elements. And you have to rotate it \$10^5\$ times. Every single rotation will need \$10^5\$ operations due to <code>array_shift</code>. Thus, total number of operations is \$10^{10}\$ which is too high.</p>

<p>You need to think of a better way to solve the problem. Is there a way to combine multiple rotations somehow?</p>

<p>Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially. It means that the number of bits representing them grows linearly, and so does the complexity of computing <code>nextFibonacci</code>. It results in the overall quadratic complexity of your loop.</p>

<p>Good news is that you don't need to compute Fibonacci numbers at all. You only need to compute Pisano numbers. They obey the similar recurrence,</p>

<pre><code>    p[n+1] = (p[n] + p[n-1]) % m
</code></pre>

<p>and by virtue of the modulo they never exceed <code>m</code>. A complexity of an individual addition stays constant, and the overall complexity becomes linear.</p>

<p>(Tiny additional: \$ (a + b)\ \textrm{mod}\ c\equiv a\ \textrm{mod}\ c\ + a\ \textrm{mod}\ c\$)</p>

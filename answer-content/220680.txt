<p>It looks like your logic is fine, but I don't find it very readable. I guess it would be fine if you could clearly explain your logic in a tech interview, but here's how I'd write it just to be more clear. </p>

<p>Use a <code>for</code> loop (that's what they're for!), modify the digits array in place unless they specify you shouldn't, and you can return as soon as you don't have anything left to carry.</p>

<pre><code>var plusOne = function(digits){
    let carry=1;

    for(let i=digits.length-1; i&gt;=0; i--){
        let digitSum = carry + digits[i];
        if(digitSum &gt;= 10){
            digits[i] = digitSum%10;
        }
        else{
            digits[i] = digitSum;
            return digits;
        }
    }

    if(carry == 1){
        digits.unshift(1);
    }
    return digits;
}
</code></pre>

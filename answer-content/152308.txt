<p>If you need that many replacements for a <em>simple</em> search then I think either the data or the filter is broken.</p>

<p>I guess all those delimiters (?) have some meaning, usually they have and they look like they have, so try to build the filter according to the rules instead of changing the data to match the <em>invalid</em> filter.</p>

<p>I can't speak to the Java-related aspects of your solution, but you've got one problem that would be an issue in any language: you're performing far more dynamic allocation than necessary.</p>

<p>In your case, you know exactly how much space you need: two grids of <code>width*height</code> space each.  Instead of allocating a new grid every generation, just allocate the space you need at game startup.  With each generation, swap which one represents the current state, and which one represents the next state.  You can do this by allocating <code>grid</code> as a three-dimensional array, or by allocating two <code>grid</code>s and swapping references, or whatever other method you think is easiest.</p>

<p>The thing with bash is more often then not... there is a tool that you can leverage to do what you want. When writing bash scripts, I try write as little bash as possible, and to leverage these tools where best possible to avoid bash (seems counter intuitive, but is the nature of bash to write as little bash as possible).  For example have you heard of the command tuptime?  (<a href="https://manpages.debian.org/testing/tuptime/tuptime.1.en.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://manpages.debian.org/testing/tuptime/tuptime.1.en.html</a>)</p>

<p>This is what it looks like after a reboot (is packaged with apt):</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install tuptime
$ tuptime | grep "System downtime"
System downtime:    0.15 %   -   32 seconds
</code></pre>

<p>Is not a complete answer because does not cover the <code>&gt;5</code> hrs case above.  </p>

<p>For reference, here is a run of tuptime</p>

<pre><code>$ tuptime
System startups:    2   since   11:02:34 AM 02/05/2020

<p>If wanting something more specific, I would also consider <code>last</code> command which gives you information about when people logged in or out (using <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/last.1.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/last.1.html</a>).</p>

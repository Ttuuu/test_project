<p>Neither is a good idea. Note the term <code>arbitrary depth</code>. It will be easy to make this explode by constructing input that is deeper than your stack, since you recurse and Python has an explicitly limited stack. Even if it didn't have a limited stack, Python does not have tail recursion optimization so this will be (relatively) slow. You should attempt to make an iterative solution instead.</p>

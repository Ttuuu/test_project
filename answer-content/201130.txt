<p>Just a few quick points on your code:  </p>

<ul>
<li>any future imports should be at the top of any code. Are you using this intentionally (2to3?) or this is leftover code?</li>
<li>your loop to generate test data overrides <code>i</code> in two secondary loops - this is bad coding practice.</li>
<li>you're using xrange, which is pretty much deprecated since Python 2.3. Are you really using Python 2.3 or you just have stuck with xrange?</li>
<li>no entry point aka <code>if __name__ == "__main__":</code> to demonstrate the start of your code, you have pieces of code scattered around your listing.</li>
<li><p>Your code as-is with the random function cannot prove Numba JIT nor caching will have any effect. My results for your functions show:  </p>

<p>CacheInfo(hits=0, misses=665297, maxsize=0, currsize=0)<br>
CacheInfo(hits=0, misses=1000, maxsize=0, currsize=0)</p>

<p>Which is to be expected with a random dataset. It's recommended to put a real dataset somewhere on the 'net for people to use.  </p></li>
<li><p>SimpleSpanMoment uses a global variable <code>L</code>, you should rewrite the function to inject all variables (or create them inside the function) and not use global variables.  </p></li>
<li><p>cstep_size is unused.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Hope this helps you move towards a better implementation, to solve the performance issue. Good Luck!</p>

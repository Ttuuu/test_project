<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>One way to almost halve the number of lines (and levels of indentation) needed is to use <code>dict.get</code> with <code>[]</code> as the optional default option:</p>

<pre><code>def check_for_word(ocr):
    for region in ocr["regions"]:
        for lines in region.get("lines", []):
            for word in lines.get("words", []):
                if "text" in word:
                    return word["text"].lower()
    else:
        raise KeyError("OCR word not found")
</code></pre>

<p>I would also move the printing outside the function, so you can immediately <code>return</code> and add a <code>else</code> clause to catch the case that it is not present (this part could also be done outside with your code by checking for <code>None</code>).</p>

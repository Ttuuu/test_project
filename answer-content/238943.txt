<p>This alone suggests that your approach is very problematic. To do this properly you'd effectively need to write most of a C parser, and that isn't a good use of your time. There are other approaches that would get you more mileage and accuracy:</p>

<ul>
<li>Double-check that your compiler (gcc?) for sure doesn't have <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Warning-Options.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">warnings</a> that cover your use-case; if it does, then simply compile and look at the output.</li>
<li>Failing that, reuse a parser. I recommend the <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/IntroductionToTheClangAST.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Clang AST</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bash is just the hideously wrong tool for this. Save yourself the pain of writing regexes that are both complex and likely missing many edge cases.</p>

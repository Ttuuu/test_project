<p><code>Map.values()</code> creates an iteratable object. It does not require an array to be created and is <span class="math-container">\$O(1)\$</span> storage as it iterates over the already stored values</p>
<p>You have forced the map to be stored as an array. <code>Array.from(map.values())</code> That means that it must be iterated and stored <span class="math-container">\$O(n)\$</span> complexity and storage best case. If you just kept the map and iterated to find the result you could have a best case of <span class="math-container">\$O(1)\$</span> to find the result.</p>
<p>Always iterate iteratable objects to reduce memory uses and if there is an early exit to reduce CPU use and complexity.</p>

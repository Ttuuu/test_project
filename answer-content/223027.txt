<p>No, this is not lispy at all.</p>

<p>Lispers use recursion only when necessary, not as a generic substitute for iteration. Moreover, even in scheme they use <em>tail</em> recursion instead of iteration, and your code is not tail recursive.</p>

<p>A typical lisp solution would be</p>

<pre class="lang-lisp prettyprint-override"><code>(defun sum-stream(&amp;optional (s *standard-input*))
  (loop for line = (read-line s nil nil) while line
      sum (parse-integer line)))
(print (sum-stream))
</code></pre>

<p>You could, perhaps, derive RecursiveObject from FlatObject.</p>

<p>In the degenerate case in which all objects belong to a single lineage (every object has one and only one child, except the last one) and you have <strong>lots</strong> of objects, then your recursive method will try to use an awful lot of stack space, possibly failing with a stack overflow exception. The way to correct this is by avoiding recursion and adding a stack data structure within your function, which then works in a loop. But of course you would not want to do that unless there is a very clear possibility of such a degenerate case ever occurring. </p>

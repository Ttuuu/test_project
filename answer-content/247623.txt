<h2>Fix your indentation.</h2>
<p>Your indentation is messed up.</p>
<hr>
<p>This is silly:</p>
<pre><code>++i, ++i
</code></pre>
<p>Make it readable:</p>
<pre><code>i += 2
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p>You jump by two (as you know all even numbers, except 2, are not prime). But you can improve that by jumping by 2 or 4. This is because we know that all multiples of 2 and 3 are not prime and every third 2 lines up with every second 3 but this makes a pattern so you can jump by 2 then 4 then 2 then 4 etc.</p>
<pre><code> bool isPrime(int val)
 {
     if (val == 2 || val == 3) {
         return true;
     }
     if (val &lt; 2 || val % 2 == 0 || val % 3 == 0) {
         return false;
     }

     int sq   = sqrt(val);
     int step = 4;
     for(int i = 5; i &lt;= sq; i += step)
     {
         if (num % i == 0) {
              return false;
         }
         step = 6 - step;
     }
     return true;
 }
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p>This is fine for small numbers. But once you start looking at large primes you need to use the "Sieve of Eratosthenes".</p>
<p>Basically you don't need to try every number you just need to try all the primes below your number. So keep track of all the numbers you have thrown away (because they are multiples of a lower prime) and check those against your numbers.</p>

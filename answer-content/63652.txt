<p>Besides all that ChrisWue said, there's also the rather odd way the UI is structured: you use a grid but then don't <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb514525(v=vs.90).aspx" rel="nofollow">define any rows or columns</a> and instead use HorizontalAlignment, VerticalAlignment and Margin to position your elements. I'm assuming this is the result of using Design view, when it would have been better to use the XAML view.</p>

<p>I don't even think a Grid is the best solution here, I'd much prefer <a href="http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/uploadfile/mahesh/stackpanel-in-wpf/" rel="nofollow">nested StackPanels</a>, especially for the 3x3 button grid. IMHO <code>Grid.Row="0" Grid.Column="0"</code> is ugly and error-prone, whilst StackPanels provide an easy to follow flow.</p>

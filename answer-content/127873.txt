<h2>Variables and Naming</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><code>to_piglatin</code> isn't a very good name. Try making it <code>language</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>Speaking of <code>lang</code>, it doesn't look like you need it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You only use question once. Just put it inside the call to input on the next line.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Change <code>list_word</code> to <code>word_list</code>. That sounds more natural.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The main method should be in something like this: (more pythonic)</p>
<pre><code>if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That is the standard for main methods, so if you, at a later date, decide to import you code from another file, the main method will not run and you can still use the translation functions.</p>
<h2>Code logic</h2>
<ol>
<li>Repeated calls to main can eventually overflow the stack trace (heh, stackoverflow).  Try making a Boolean that keeps track of the user has inputed a correct value, and put the entire input sequence in a while loop.</li>
<li>Why do you have an empty input?</li>
<li>Why does the main method return <code>True</code>? If anything (which it shouldn't, having a name like <code>main</code>), it should return the translated list.</li>
<li><code>"the"</code> gets translated to <code>"hetay"</code> (not actual piglatin)</li>
<li>You don't have to enter an if statement to set a Boolean variable; just set it to the thing in the if.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's about it for me. Other people will probably have better suggestions. Happy coding!</p>

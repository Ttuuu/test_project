<p><strong>Structure: Fields</strong></p>

<p><code>firstNumber</code>, <code>secondNumber</code>, and <code>answer</code> should not be fields. Fields are supposed to hold the state of an object across operations. But in your case, they are not actually used outside of the functions. And they shouldn't be either. </p>

<p>The result of an addition has nothing to do with the result or input of a previous multiplication, so they should be variables of those functions.</p>

<p>Instead of setting fields, your <code>getNumbers</code> function should just return the numbers (and make it singular, which makes it easier to use and also to reuse).</p>

<p><strong>Structure: Functions</strong></p>

<p>Ideally, functions should do one thing. Your functions do quite a bit more: They calculate, but they also print, get input, and resume calculator operations. For such a small project it may not matter that much, but generally, such a structure severely impacts testabiliy and reusability.</p>

<p>You should move <code>getNumbers</code> and <code>calculator</code> into the main <code>calculator</code> function. This also removes some duplication and thus makes your code shorter. Then, your calculation functions should just return the result, which can then also be printed in the main <code>calculator</code> function.</p>

<p><strong>Naming</strong></p>

<p>Objects are things, while functions are actions, and this should be reflected in their names. For example, instead of a functions called <code>subtraction</code>, you would call it <code>subtract</code>, because it isn't a subtraction, but it subtracts something. Same with <code>calculator</code> which may be <code>startCalculator</code> or <code>calculate</code>.</p>

<p><code>pick</code> is also a bit generic. Sure, the user picked something, but what did they pick? <code>chosenOperation</code> might be clearer.</p>

<p><strong>Misc</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>don't import <code>*</code>, import the specific classes that you need to increase readability.</li>
<li>your formatting is a bit off (indentation, too much vertical whitespace)</li>
<li>your fields should generally be private if there is no good reason to make them public</li>
</ul>

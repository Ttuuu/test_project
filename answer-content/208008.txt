<p>This is rarely where Python lives. Typically you should instead write</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3
</code></pre>

<p>Your rooms dict shouldn't really be a dict. Dicts are good for serialization and web APIs, but in Python they're often abused. You should use a <code>namedtuple</code>, if not an actual class.</p>

<p>Here:</p>

<pre><code># Displays a map of all the accesable rooms from the current room.
def room_map():
</code></pre>

<p>The convention for function documentation is to use the following format:</p>

<pre><code>def room_map():
"""
Displays a map of all the accessible rooms from the current room.
"""
</code></pre>

<p>When you do this:</p>

<pre><code>try:
    north = rooms[currentRoom]['north']
except:
    north = ""
</code></pre>

<p>There are several problems. First, your except clause is way, way too broad. You probably want to catch <code>KeyError</code>. However, the saner thing to do is:</p>

<pre><code>north = rooms.get(currentRoom, {}).get('north', '')
</code></pre>

<p>You also have a bunch of code in global scope. This should be reduced - you should move that code into one or more functions.</p>

<pre><code>'You can\'t go that way!'
</code></pre>

<p>should simply be</p>

<pre><code>"You can't go that way!"
</code></pre>

<p>Iâ€™ll focus solely on the image processing algorithm. You find the lowest value (N comparisons), then find which pixels have this value (another N comparisons), and repeat this until you have K values. So you do about 2NK comparisons.</p>
<p>This is OK for small K, but as it gets larger, this becomes a very inefficient algorithm.</p>
<p>Instead, you could sort all pixels (<code>np.argsort</code> returns the indices to the sorted pixels). Since the pixel values are integers, you can use counting sort, which takes about 2N operations, but even the general quicksort would be OK to use.</p>
<p>Next, finding the next lowest pixel is a single operation. So your algorithm goes from about 2NK operations to 2N+K, a huge saving for larger K.</p>

<p>You are storing all of the <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> inputs in sorted vectors, basically doing an insertion sort.  A few observations (two minor, one major):</p>

<ol>
<li>The <code>if (c == 1)</code> special case should be eliminated.</li>
<li>Flag variables (<code>founda</code> and <code>foundb</code>) suck.  You would be better off writing two separate <code>for</code> loops.</li>
<li><p>Each time you insert a value, all values beyond the insertion point need to be shifted over to make room for the insertion.  That means that constructing <code>as</code> and <code>bs</code> takes O(<em>N</em><sup>2</sup>) time altogether â€” which is unacceptable, since <em>N</em> can be very large.</p>

<p>However, there are only 100 possible values of <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>.  So, do a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_sort" rel="nofollow noreferrer">counting sort</a> instead, building a histogram with 100 buckets.  That would be a much more efficient way to represent the same information, using O(<em>N</em>) time and a fixed amount of space.</p></li>

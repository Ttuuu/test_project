<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>        _DateCreated = value;
        _DateCreated = DateTime.SpecifyKind(_DateCreated, DateTimeKind.Utc);//ensure this is set
</code></pre>

<p>This creates a race condition: another thread can access <code>_DateCreated</code> in between the two assignments and get a non-UTC value. If you're going to do it at this level it should be</p>

<pre><code>        _DateCreated = DateTime.SpecifyKind(value, DateTimeKind.Utc);
</code></pre>

<p>That leaves the question of whether it should be done at this level. You haven't said how you're getting the date from the database. Can that be configured?</p>

  <p>This would have me questioning the use of DateTime in any scenario - and always using DateTimeOffset!?!</p>

<p>Yes. <code>DateTime</code> is one of those mistakes that everyone recognises is a mistake, but is so deeply embedded in so many libraries and tools that it's a pain in the neck to eradicate.</p>

<p>It looks like you're completely mixing up business and display layers / responsibilities. You could simplify things by getting rid of c/s/g/p separation in most of the functions. <code>Add(int amount, Coins type)</code> and <code>Add(int platinum, int gold, int silver, int copper)</code> don't need to exist for example. If you stick to just base value everywhere apart from the display you'll have less work with:</p>

<ul>
<li>storage (it's just one value)</li>
<li>shops (again, one value, not four)</li>
<li>economy fixes (do you want to recalculate all values, or just do <code>prices*=1.1</code> at some point in the future)</li>
<li>any features that affect prices as a fraction (haggling skills?)</li>
</ul>

<p><code>HasCopper</code> and similar methods are not super intuitive. Does a bag with <code>1 gold</code> <code>HasCopper</code>, or not?</p>

<p>The mutable empty / filled bags are an accident waiting to happen.</p>

<p>I don't understand why you're using <code>Math.Abs</code> in <code>Compute....</code> functions. They're not supposed to be ever negative, are they?</p>

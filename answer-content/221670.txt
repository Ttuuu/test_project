<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>The code looks pretty good. I only see a couple CSS rules that appear to be useless - for instance:</p>

<pre><code>background: #eeeeee;
</code></pre>

<p>under the ruleset:</p>

<pre><code>.button span {
</code></pre>

<p>But that style is overridden by the background styles under the <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> tags (i.e. <code>.orange .button span</code> and <code>.amber .button span</code>). The only reason I could think that would be needed is if you have other HTML not included in the example above that would have other colors...</p>

<p>What is the goal of the styles for <code>html</code>? I read the answers to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/2593106/1575353"><em>Styling the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element in CSS?</em></a> and it leads me to believe it is an attempt to avoid scrollbars, but maybe that is incorrect.</p>

<hr>

<p>And is it really necessary to specify </p>

<pre><code>background: #ffffff;
</code></pre>

<p>for the <code>body</code> tag? Maybe there are browser settings I am unaware of that allow a user to have a default background color other than that??</p>

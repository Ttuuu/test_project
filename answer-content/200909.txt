<p>Thanks very much to JNevill for his solution - it is indeed significantly faster than my original code. I had to make some changes to accommodate more than one # column, as well as headers to the left of the indented hierarchy column i.e.:</p>

<pre><code>Region        Base Level        Account 1     Account 2    

 USA         Level 1               500           800
 USA             Level 2a          300           400
 USA             Level 2b          200           400
</code></pre>

<p>Here is my new code based on JNevill's framework:</p>

<pre><code>Sub HierarchyConvert()

Dim LastIndent              As Integer

        For i = 1 To Indent
            rngWriteRow.Cells(1, i + 1).Value = rngWriteRow.Cells(1, i + 1).Offset(-1).Value
        Next i
    End If
    rngWriteRow.Cells(Indent + 2).Value = Trim(rngReadCell.Value)
    If Indent = MaxIndent Then
        'Copies leftmost header from base-level row to top left of write-row
        rngWriteRow.Cells(1) = rngReadCell.Offset(, -1).Value
        'Copies data to right of base-level row to the write-row
        For Z = 0 To 19
            ValueArray(Z) = rngReadCell.Offset(, Z + 6).Value

<p><strong>naming comments.</strong></p>

<p>In general dont surprise people. I found these things surprising</p>

<p><code>typename V</code> Although perfectly valid and correct, everybody expects <code>T</code> not <code>V</code></p>

<p>Using a naming convention for non member variables. You use an _ prefix for parameters and locals. Again perfectly correct (although prepending '_' is not really a good thing, it comes close to using reserved names). But most people expect the opposite, special names for member variables and 'plain' names for parameters and locals</p>

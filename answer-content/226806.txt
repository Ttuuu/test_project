<p>The code has certainly improved since I last saw it. There's only one thing that stands out to me, and it's the URL construction. The 'simple' way to make it more legible is to split it up onto multiple lines using implicit concatenation:</p>

<pre><code>url = (
    "http://example.com"
    "/arcgis/rest/services/Something"
    "/Zones/MapServer/15/query?"
    "geometry={0}%2C{1}&amp;"
    "geometryType=esriGeometryPoint&amp;"
    "spatialRel=esriSpatialRelIntersects&amp;"
    "outFields=*&amp;"
    "returnGeometry=false&amp;"
    "f=pjson"
).format(longx, laty)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the <code>str</code> calls have also been removed; the <code>format</code> call does that for you.</p>

<p>Also, and this is domain-specific so I can't give any specific advice, but: if you're able to narrow <code>outFields</code> so that you get only the fields back that you need from the server, that will be more efficient than <code>*</code>.</p>

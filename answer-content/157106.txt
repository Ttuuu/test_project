<p>I think that working with a natural language style query builder has sent your implementation a little astray. I don't understand why you need to select a count of rows from a sub-queried result set when you could just count the rows returned from the query itself, without even pulling the result set down into the application.</p>

<p>Outside of that, I find your code hard to read.</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't mix use of brackets on each side of if-else conditional</li>
<li>Consider using PSR-2 compliant styles

<ul>
<li>putting start of brackets for functions/methods, conditionals and looping constructs on same line. </li>
<li>Don't mix snake_case and camelCase within your user-written code.</li>
<li>One instruction per line.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Limit line lengths to ~80 characters.</li>
</ul>

<h1>UI</h1>

<p>Instead of a number input, a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/range" rel="nofollow noreferrer">range input</a> could be used - with the minimum value being zero and the maximum value being half of the lesser of the height and width - in this case 88 pixels (i.e. 175px / 2). With such an input there is no need to validate user input to ensure non-numeric characters are entered.</p>

<p>With the current interface, the event handler that fires when a key is pressed does not execute when the value changes from other means (e.g. mouse click). To be thorough, it might be better to observe the <code>change</code> event on the input as well.</p>

<h1>Code</h1>

<p>The JavaScript code makes good use of <code>const</code> for values that don't get re-assigned, and uses <code>getElementById()</code> (as I mentioned in <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/205457/120114">a review of your <em>Nav scroll</em> code</a>). I like how the constant for the warning time is in all capitals, and all lines are terminated with a semi-colon.</p>

<p>The regular expression could be simplified slightly to use the shorthand character class <code>\d</code> instead of <code>[0-9]</code>.</p>

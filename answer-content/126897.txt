<p>Your naming is much better than that used by most people who come here.  The names are very clear so I can see exactly what logic you are using.  My one suggestion is to use <code>_</code> between different words; for example, <code>length_of_the_list</code>.  It isn't necessary, but it's a little better in my opinion.  I, actually, would just say <code>length</code>.  There isn't anything else here that has a length.</p>

<p>You defined <code>lengthofthelist</code>, but you don't appear to be using it.  You keep re-finding the length for each <code>if</code> and <code>elif</code>.  Use the variables that you create.</p>

<p>Your first <code>if</code> makes sure that <code>sortedlist</code> has only one item, but then iterates through it.  If it has just one item, the sum of all of its items will be just that one item.  Therefore, you can say <code>return sortedlist[0]</code>.</p>

<p>You define <code>medianparties</code> as an empty list, but then you re-define it to something else.  The first definition is useless.  The second, in fact, is also useless because you can put it right into the <code>for</code> loop: <code>for value in sortedlist[...]:</code></p>

<p>In the <code>elif</code> you define <code>median</code> within the loop, but it doesn't need to be defined until the end.  In fact, you can just take out its definition and change your <code>return</code> to <code>return temp / 2</code>.  Well, really, use the <code>sum()</code> function instead of finding out the sum yourself.</p>

<p>Your <code>else</code> has a couple interesting things.  As I mentioned above, you shouldn't define a variable if all you are going to do is redefine it.  Therefore, the first definition of <code>medianpart</code> is useless.  You then define <code>medianpart</code> as a list with one item: <code>sortedlist[centerofthelist]</code>.  After that, you go through each item in that list (which is just one item), and assign <code>median</code> to it.  If all you are doing with a list is assigning a variable to each item, that variable will be the last item in the last once you finish.  You can just assign it to the last item with <code>median = medianpart[-1]</code>, but what is the last item?  Of course, it is the only item: <code>sortedlist[centerofthelist]</code>.  Since you already know what the item is, why not assign it directly without defining <code>medianpart</code> at all?  In fact, you don't even need a variable defined anyway.  You can change your whole <code>else</code> block to this:</p>

<pre><code>else:
    return sortedlist[centerofthelist]
</code></pre>

<p>The full program:</p>

<pre><code>def median(thelist):
    sorted_list = sorted(thelist)
    length = len(sorted_list)
    center = length // 2

    if length == 1:
        return sorted_list[0]

    elif length % 2 == 0:
        return sum(sorted_list[center - 1: center + 1]) / 2.0

    else:
        return sorted_list[center]
</code></pre>

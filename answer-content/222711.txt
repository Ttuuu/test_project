<p>A few fixes / possible improvements:</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Scheduler Crash on Exception</strong></p>

<p>This is the most significant I've found. The thread responsible for Starting the Pending Task first awaits the Current Task completion, but an exception will abort this continuation, leaving the queue in a hung state. The exception should be caught.</p>

<pre><code>if (a.Pending.Acquire()) {
    try {
        await a.Current.Acquired;
    }
    catch {}
    a.Pending.Acquired.Start();
}
</code></pre>

<p>(After discovering this defect, I first incorrectly edited the code, which a moderator pointed out to me. I've reverted the fix and moved it to this answer.)</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Contract-stated thread assignment mismatch</strong></p>

<p><strong>Disagreement between Pending and Current SynchronizationContext</strong></p>

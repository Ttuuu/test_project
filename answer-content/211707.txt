<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>I see a couple occurrences of:</p>

<pre><code>do
{
    hasSorted = 0;
    ...other things...
    if(hasSorted == 0)
    {
        break;
    }
}while(hasSorted == 0);
</code></pre>

<p>Did you mean <code>if(hasSorted == 1)</code> in those? If not, then you might want to just get rid of the whole if statement and replace the while condition with <code>while(hasSorted != 0)</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Also, comments that describe the whole function could look better on a separate line right before the function, so that the line doesn't get too long. </p>
    </div>

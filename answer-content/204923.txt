<h1>Missing tests</h1>

<p>I don't see any tests for commands that should time out.  An obvious example could be <code>sleep 2</code>, if we run it with a timeout of <code>1</code>.  A more rigorous test would be a command that ignores all signals (of the ones that can be ignored) - we should ensure that if <code>SIGTERM</code> doesn't work, that it will get <code>SIGKILL</code> eventually.</p>

<h1>Data-driven tests</h1>

<p>I don't like to see loops within test cases.  Does Boost Test have provision for repeating tests with different data?  Most test frameworks do; I'd be surprised if that were missing from Boost.</p>

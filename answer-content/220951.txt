<h2>Lexicon</h2>

<p>I'm a fan of using common terminology for best practices. You are creating a <em>lexer</em> rather than a <em>parser</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Parser</a>: Within computational linguistics the term is used to refer to the formal analysis by a computer of a sentence or other string of words into its constituents, resulting in a <strong>parse tree</strong> showing their syntactic relation to each other, which may also contain semantic and other information.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Lexer/Tokenizer</a>: In computer science, lexical analysis, lexing or tokenization is the process of <strong>converting a sequence of characters</strong> (such as in a computer program or web page) into a sequence of tokens (strings with an assigned and thus identified meaning)</li>
</ul>

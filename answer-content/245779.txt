<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<ol>
<li><p>Every other condition (for user input validation) adds to the <code>errors</code> array, whereas password matching simply does an <code>echo</code>?</p>
<pre><code> if ($pw !== $pw2) {
     echo "Your passwords do not match";
 }
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>When checking for existing username/email, you don't really need to fetch the associated row itself. You can use <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/mysqli-result.num-rows.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the <code>num_rows</code></a> to check if it is <span class="math-container">\$ \ge 1 \$</span>. These check for existing conditions also have <code>echo</code> statements, instead of appending to the <code>errors</code> array.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you're on php 5.4+, the arrays can be declared using square brackets. No need for the <code>array()</code> method:</p>
<pre><code> $pw = password_hash($_POST['pw'], PASSWORD_BCRYPT, ['cost' =&gt; 14]);
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>You generate the list/array of errors occurred during processing of the user input, but at the end, do nothing useful with it. Ideally, these errors should be returned back to the application and shown to the user so that they may update values as needed.</p>

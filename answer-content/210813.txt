<p><strong>The <code>swap()</code> function is unecessary</strong></p>

<p>There's no need to create a <code>swap()</code> function. This can be done as a one-liner using native PHP. And, generally speaking, native functionality is going to be more performant than user-defined functions. It also means less code for you to write or maintain.</p>

<pre><code>list($a,$b) = [$b, $a];
</code></pre>

<p>This takes two values, places them in an array and then using <code>list()</code> swaps them. In your case it would look like:</p>

<pre><code>list($arr[$keys[$i]],$arr[$keys[$target]]) = [$arr[$keys[$target]], $arr[$keys[$i]]];
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Friendly reminder: don't use short tags</strong>    </p>

<p>Short PHP tags (<code>&lt;?</code>) has been discouraged for a long time. Although it is still supported it is disabled by default in the php.ini file and its use is discouraged. It sounds like it is not a big deal but this means having to make sure every time you set up an environment for this to run you have to make a special configuration change which is risky and time consuming and really shouldn't be necessary. (The short echo tag (<code>&lt;?=</code>) is not discouraged and always available so feel free to use that as much as you like).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PHP also allows for short open tag <code>&lt;?</code> (which is discouraged since it is only available if enabled using the short_open_tag php.ini configuration file directive, or if PHP was configured with the --enable-short-tags option).</p>

<p>Just a few remarks from me:</p>

<ol>
<li>Rather than <strong>hardcoding</strong> the path in your code it would be better to use a command line <strong>argument</strong>, then it can be used like an OS command such as <code>dir</code> or <code>du</code>. That is more user-friendly since your aim is automation.</li>
<li>There is no <strong>exception handling</strong> in your code, so it will crash on permission error, which could easily happen, then you have to decide whether to skip or stop execution - but if you don't handle errors the figures are going to be incomplete, misleading and useless</li>
<li>Overall the function can be implemented more efficiently using <code>os.scandir</code> (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.scandir" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here's why</a>) instead of <code>listdir</code> (your choice)</li>
<li>Let's mention <code>os.lstat</code> too, which does not follow symbolic links because you probably don't want to count them - I notice that you are on Windows though and probably didn't give thought to the portability of this code</li>
<li>You could also have taken advantage of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.walk" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>os.walk</code></a>.</li>
<li>In fact, if you are only working on Windows and never develop on Linux machines, then you could have used Powershell and a one-liner could suffice. I would not have bothered with Python personally, not for this job.</li>
</ol>

<p>In a way this is reinventing the wheel (I just saw the tags now lol but it wasn't me) but there is education value nonetheless. However I would have made more research to find out how programmers have tackled this task before. And then, I would try to improve their code if possible or customize it. The point is to learn from others and not just guess everything and do it all from scratch.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly what you are trying to do has already been done countless times.
I was going to quote the same SO post as Reinderien. So make sure you read all of it. Because even the accepted answer can be improved (as is often the case on SO). What is evident is that the task can be accomplished in a more straightforward way.</p>

<p>What I would have done otherwise is read the manual page about os functions, even if it means skimming through, to have an overview of the functions available, then decide on the most adequate functions for the job. As you can see, the Python language is rich enough to provide different ways of doing things.</p>

<p>Python can certainly help you automate the boring stuff, it's just that in this particular case the benefit is not that obvious, considering that your script does not have any options and therefore does less than the tools that already exist.</p>

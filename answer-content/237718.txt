<p>A few notes on your code above:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>connect_mssqlserver</code> and <code>connect_mysqlserver</code> could be condensed to a single 'connect' function that takes a <code>conn_str</code> arg to be used in <code>create_engine</code>.</li>
<li>I believe <code>create_df</code> seems to be unnecessary at this point. If the process for creating the df involves more than just calling <code>read_sql</code> in the future, then I would opt for moving that logic into a separate function.</li>
<li>nitpick: I would change <code>source_df.empty == False</code> and the following <code>True</code> check to just <code>not source.empty and dest_df.empty</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Good start, but here are a few comments:</p>

<ol>
<li>The name for this class should be <code>Vector2D</code> rather than <code>Vector</code>, because you cannot represent a 3D or nD vectors using this class.</li>
<li><p><code>int</code> is not right type for representing points; <code>double</code>s fit more</p>

<pre><code>double x;
double y;
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>By default, fields in Java have package access and it's usually a horrible idea. You should hide your fields as much as you can.</p>

<pre><code>private double x;
private double y;
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>This type of object screams immutability. Believe or not, when you start putting them in arrays and maps, it becomes really hard to deal their state, and end up copying them every time you use them.</p>

<pre><code>public Vector add(Vector vector) {
  Vector newVector = new Vector(this.x + vector.x,this.y + vector.y);
  return newVector
}
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>I can't yet comment, so a couple little things.<br>
1. Your print statements are way too long. In your if statement those 4 prints can be one. And why the breaks in your intro statement (let + ' + s)?<br>
2. Your logic gets a little messy in the case of a tie, though I suppose it will print both statements.<br>
3. You may already know this, but you cannot concatenate strings with objects or integers in Python, and due to dynamic typing, it can be hard to keep track of thing.</p>

<p>This whole program could be produced in 2 functions. A function called win, which takes a variable winningPlayer, and a function called Roll for the dice. That would take care of your infinite loop as well.<br>
NOTE: I'm bad with dynamic types. There are probably unnecessary casts to strings here, but I'm just showing the concept.</p>

<pre><code>import random

#Rolls the dice when players are wrong
def Roll(rollNum):
    print("The Dice rolled..." + str(rollNum))
    print("both wrong, rolling again...")
    reRoll = random.randint(1,6)
    time.sleep(1)
    return reRoll
#Generic function for what the winner and loser do; not player specific
def Win(winner, loser, prz):
    print("The Dice rolled..." + str(diceNumber) + "\n" + str(winner).upper() + "Wins\n" + str(loser) + " must " + str(prz))
#Copied from your code
print("lets play dice of destiny")
play1 = input("Player 1 name?")
play2 = input("Player 2 name?")
prize = input("What does the loser have to do?")
#slightly condensed your code
print("Hi " + play1 + " &amp; " + play2 + ", let's roll the dice of destiny.")
#moved this to a more appropriate place
diceNumber = random.randint(1,6)
play1Num = int(input(play1 + " choose a number 1-6."))
play2Num = int(input(play2 + " choose a number 1-6."))
#changed while loop to roll the dice every time both are wrong
while play1Num != diceNumber and play2Num != diceNumber:
    diceNumber = Roll(diceNumber)
    play1Num = int(input(play1 + " choose a number 1-6."))
    play2Num = int(input(play2 + " choose a number 1-6."))
#Applies the win method to both players; an array would be a better approach
if play1Num == diceNumber:
    Win(play1, play2, prize)
elif play2Num == diceNumber:
    Win(play2, play1, prize)
#Array implementation of win (with more than 2 players, would be best done using *args in win)
players = [play1Num, play2Num]
for item in players
    if diceNumber == item:
        players.remove(item)
        Win(item, players[1], prize)

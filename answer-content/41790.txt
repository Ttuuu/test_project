<p>The FastCollection contains an additional list and a dictionary of lists, so it's memory consumption overhead might become an issue.</p>

<p>I would suggest that you look into representing your data structure (Product) in a data structure which is more optimal for searching than a list. If you into tree-structures or balanced tree structures, you will see that searching cost O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the tree.</p>

<p>You can easily build the tree structure with a custom compare function, and thereby having a very fast generic searchable structure.</p>

<p>Well, just an idea, which you might consider overkill :)</p>

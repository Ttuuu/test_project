<p>We can see patterns in the columns. We'll take <span class="math-container">\$x\$</span> as the input to the function. <span class="math-container">\$x\$</span> starts at 1, which will map to the bottom row of the triangle.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The first column, "1, 2, 4, 7", can be expressed as:
<span class="math-container">$$\frac{(x+0)(x-1)}{2}+1$$</span></p>
</li>
<li><p>The second column, "3, 5, 8", can be expressed as:
<span class="math-container">$$\frac{(x+1)(x+0)}{2}+2$$</span></p>
</li>
<li><p>The third column can be expressed as:
<span class="math-container">$$\frac{(x+2)(x+1)}{2}+3$$</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You should now be able to see that these equations are also making a pattern. Each of the <span class="math-container">\$x\$</span> in the numerator of the fraction are increasing by one each column. Additionally the amount added to the fraction increases by one each column.</p>
<p>And so we can use <span class="math-container">\$y\$</span> to denote the column, and just use the following equation.</p>
<p><span class="math-container">$$\frac{(x+y-1)(x+y-2)}{2} + x$$</span></p>

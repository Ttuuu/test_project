<ol>
<li><pre><code>x(max - ((position + velocity) % max))
</code></pre>

<p>doesn't look quite right. <code>% max</code> does not help here much (see below) it is better replaced with <code>- max</code>, and thus the whole formula turns into <code>2 * max - (position + velocity)</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Do you assume large velocities are impossible, in other words, in the first alternative, can you guarantee that <code>Math.abs(position + velocity)</code> is always LE than <code>max</code>?</p></li>
</ol>

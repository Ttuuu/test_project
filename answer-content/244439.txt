<p>The problem statement is much more about logical reasoning than about coding. On a unix/linux terminal, the challenge can be solved with 15 characters!</p>
<pre><code>sed 's/1.*0/0/'
</code></pre>
<p>The equivalent c++ code is also a one-liner when using <code>regex::replace</code>, or a three-liner with <code>string::find</code> and <code>string::replace</code>. If you read the instructions carefully and work through a few examples, you will find two important properties (a formal proof is just as easy):</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Any binary string that starts with a one and ends in zero can be reduced to a single digit. You even have the choice whether this digit is zero or one.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Leading zeros and trailing ones cannot be reduced.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To solve the challenge, just ignore leading zeros and trailing ones and replace the middle part, if non-empty, with a single zero digit. That's what my <code>sed</code> script does.</p>

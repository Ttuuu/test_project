<p>Your Node side could be simplified by sending over the readings JSON as a singular list of objects.</p>
<pre><code>// assuming readings looks like this

[
    {
        'fridge':'old sketchy fridge',
        'temperature':-3,
        'comment':'yup, still works'
    },
    {
        'fridge':'new fancy fridge',
        'temperature':-4,
        'comment':'this one better be worth the money'
    }
]

const {readings} = req.body;
const values = readings.map(
    reading=&gt;[reading.fridge,reading.temperature,reading.comment]
);
</code></pre>
<p>Your use case sounds ideal for React, but vanilla javascript can also help you remove duplicated code. Anytime you find yourself creating a variable with a number tacked on the end of the name, you should be suspicious.</p>

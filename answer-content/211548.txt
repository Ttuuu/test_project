<p>Prefer to use <code>$TMPDIR</code> if set, and <code>/tmp</code> only as a fallback.  That's the standard practice that allows users to have separate, private temporary directories, for example, so don't subvert it!  You probably ought to consider <code>tempfile.â€‹TemporaryDirectory()</code> as an alternative.</p>

<p>Error messages should go to standard error channel, not standard output.</p>

<p>I don't know Mac OS, but on Linux I'd expect you to wait on <code>inotify</code>, rather than polling the <code>dev</code> directory.  There's a choice of Python interface to <code>inotify</code>, but I'm not in a position to recommend any in particular.</p>

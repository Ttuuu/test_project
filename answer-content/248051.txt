<p>This "global function" style works for small scripts but isn't reusable.</p>
<p>A more practical problem with it is if you want to have state that is shared between functions, you don't have anywhere to store it (well, you could use global variables (<code>$var</code>), but that's prone to conflicts).</p>
<p>For a more encapsulated design, create a class that does the work and move the methods into the class. See for example <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-ruby-driver/blob/master/.evergreen/tools.rb" rel="nofollow noreferrer">definition</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-ruby-driver/blob/master/.evergreen/get-mongodb-download-url" rel="nofollow noreferrer">usage</a>.</p>

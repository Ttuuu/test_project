<p>A simple rule I (<a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/56585/where-do-you-declare-variables-the-top-of-a-method-or-when-you-need-them">and other</a>) try to apply is : define things in the smallest possible scope.</p>

<p>For instance, <code>int UserNumber = 0;</code> can be moved inside the loop.</p>

<p>Similarly, <code>k</code> can be moved once you've made your loop a <code>for</code> loop : <code>for(int k = 1; k &lt; 11; k++)</code>.</p>

<p>Then, computer people love counting from <code>0</code>. If you write : <code>for(int k = 0; k &lt; 10; k++)</code>, I am used to this and I know straight-away that there will be 10 iterations. If you re-index your loop, you'll need to convert <code>else if (k == 10)</code> into a <code>else if (k == 9)</code>.</p>

<p>Then, you'll realise that there is no need for this check, you can just move this out of the loop.</p>

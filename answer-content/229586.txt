<p><strong>Code formatting</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Black:</li>
</ul>

<p>I recommend to use <a href="https://github.com/psf/black" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><strong>black</strong></a> to format your code.</p>

<ul>
<li>Comments:</li>
</ul>

<p>Just a personal preference: if the code in one line is getting too long, put the comment regarding the line on top of it, not in the same line to stay below a certain line length. I recommend 120, you can specify this in black.</p>

<p><strong>Cleaner code</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do not use * imports:</li>
</ul>

<p>When I go over your code, i am not able to see where the class <code>Circle</code> comes from. Is it from <code>math</code> or from <code>graphics</code>? Please only use explicit imports to only import what you need and make it easier to comprehend for other readers to find what code is used.</p>

<ul>
<li>Clarify 3rd party imports:</li>
</ul>

<p>In the docstring you meantion a <code>graphics.py</code> module, but as a reader I dont know where this is and I can not import it. I can not run the code without it. Tell me where I can get it or provide it.</p>

<ul>
<li>Redefining variables from outer scope:</li>
</ul>

<p>In <code>draw_brushes</code>, every argument variable overwrites a variable from the outer scope (module level) which can lead to nasty behaviour if you make a mistake.</p>

<ul>
<li>Dont call <code>int</code> on integers:</li>
</ul>

<p><code>int(1)</code> is just not needed.</p>

<ul>
<li>Configuration variables:</li>
</ul>

<p>You use many variables to configure your drawing, maybe you can put all those in a configuration file or at least all in one place in the code.
Its a good practice to have module level variables, global variables, in ALL CAPS.</p>

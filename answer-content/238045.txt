<p>A small trick I can give you is to do your "exit conditions" first.</p>

<p>For example, you have</p>

<pre><code>if change &gt; 0 :
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>The issue is that you then have the majority of your code indented. If you invert the condition and return, you can do this :</p>

<pre><code>if change &lt;= 0:
    print('No change')
    return
if change &gt;= 100:
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>This would give you the advantage of having less indentation in your code. <strong>Indentation is really really bad for cognitive complexity</strong>.</p>

<p>Failing fast also lets your code execute faster when it fails. In your case, this won't really apply, but if you were doing expensive calls in your conditions, you would want to fail as early as possible.</p>

<p>Always check what inverting your conditions results in. In some cases, it can make the code a lot easier to read.</p>

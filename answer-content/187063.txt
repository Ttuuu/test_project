<p>I would not be impressed with this submission. Here are some of my notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Way too many data type conversations. You're converting from string to array and back several times.</li>
<li>No validation that the value is correct. I think you actually have an error in the permission string in your example. The format is well-known and you could use a regular expression.</li>
<li>Since you'll be validating with a regular expression, you can get rid of the <code>skip(x)</code> <code>take(3)</code> stuff. Just use <code>Substring()</code>.</li>
<li><p>I wouldn't necessarily knock this point for an interview task, but I'd be more impressed with a separate class dealing with file permission strings:</p>

<pre><code>PermissionString permissionString = new PermissionString(permString);
return permissionString.ToOctal();
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

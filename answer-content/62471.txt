<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>The comment to the last function getDiv is bad. I can't figure out what it does by reading the comment, only by reading the code itself. For example: </p>

<pre><code>/* getDiv prints the result of dividing a by b and then by c. */
</code></pre>
    </div>

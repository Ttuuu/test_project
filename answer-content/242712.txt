<p>I haven't seen this pattern in use, and I wouldn't use it personally, for two reasons:</p>

<p>1) Unintuitive - Changing the function's behavior in this significant of a way is not something you'd expect from the default value of a parameter.</p>

<p>2) Mixing Concerns - It's almost always better to separate your I/O from your algorithm.</p>

<p>Considering that this is a compile-time difference anyway, it would be more clear to have another method to read input.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>foo(1);
foo(foo_input());
</code></pre>
    </div>

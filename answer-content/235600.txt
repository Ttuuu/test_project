<p>Standard C requires that <code>main()</code> return <strong><code>int</code></strong>:</p>

<pre><code>int main(void)
</code></pre>

<p>There's no need (for 20 years now) to write all local declarations before the code.  Introduce variables as you need them, so they can be initialised immediately:</p>

<pre><code>{
    char line[MAXLEN];

    int i = 0;
</code></pre>

<p>There's no need for the extra storage <code>rev</code> in <code>reverse()</code>.  We can reverse the string in place, by swapping first and last characters, then the second and second-last, and so on.</p>

<p>Use the Standard Library - it provides functions such as <code>scanf()</code>, <code>getline()</code>, <code>strcpy()</code> and <code>strlen()</code>.  Don't write your own code to do these things - it makes your code much less clear, and causes readers to wonder what's being done that's different to the standard.</p>

<li><p>Don't worry about wrapping your content too much if the style cannot be achieved without it. If it can, the extra wrap may be overkill.</p></li>
<li><p>Your markup relies a lot on the <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> where it may not be necessary. For instance, you put one <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tag into another, which is odd. You also put and <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tag into the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, which is also odd.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you want simple containers, I would recommend you stick with <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s with semantic <code>class</code> attributes. They have been around for a while and used for wrapping other tags. They are the tried and true method and their lack of semantic meaning will not confuse the reader or crawler.</p>

<p>This is a general comment on the structure of the code, and in particular how you may want to think about redesigning some of it.</p>

<p>Given your end goal is to have AI learn to play snake, you may wish to abstract away the input source, the graphics, and also anything relating to time.</p>

<p>Rather than formulate the game of snake as checking which key the user has selected at certain times, you may want to structure it as a decision each turn. Yes, this is a bit of a modification to snake, but it may be easier for you to get started. So this basically eliminates the time factor.</p>

<p>Yes, time is of major importance when it comes to human players, but developing ML that's sensitive to time constraints is more complicated. Maybe you can make it a stretch goal? :)</p>

<p>So, in general, I would have the structure as this:</p>

<p>[User]  &lt;-&gt;  [Game]  &lt;-&gt;  [Graphics]</p>

<p>When developing your AI, you swap out the user module for the AI. You also may want to have a graphics module you can swap in and out. You don't want graphics to limit how fast your AI can learn, but you may want to turn it on to see what your AI is doing from time to time.</p>

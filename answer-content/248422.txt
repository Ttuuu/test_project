<h1>Use form controls if in scope for the assignment</h1>
<p>If it's in scope for the assignment, use an <code>input</code> field to take in the weight and an HTML element like a <code>div</code> or <code>span</code> to show the result. You could add a button to submit your response, or make it automatic. You can do this by hand or use a popular framework like React (though frameworks take a while to learn, so if you're short on time you might not want to go that route). But if you aren't expected to have learned form controls yet, then <code>prompt</code> and <code>alert</code> are fine. You'll need to judge that for yourself, asking your teacher if you're unsure.</p>

<h3>Problems:</h3>

<ul>
<li><code>ShuffleMines</code> only works for exactly 4 mines. It also contains a fair amount of duplicate code. Changing the number of mines requires a decent amount of work.</li>
<li>The random tile selection does not take duplicates into account. You may end up with less than 4 mines, but elsewhere you assume that there are exactly 21 empty tiles.</li>
<li>Going through all buttons and comparing their name against what's essentially a list of names is not a very efficient approach.</li>
<li>You're treating a 5x5 grid as a single list, and you're using an offset of 1 to find the buttons directly left and right of the current one. That does not work correctly for buttons on the left or right edge of the grid - you'll end up with an orange button on the opposite edge.</li>
<li>The game-over logic does not stop the game timer.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Suggestions:</h3>

<p>Why not treat these buttons as an actual grid? A <code>Button[][] buttonsGrid</code> field would let you access buttons by their coordinates: <code>buttonsGrid[x][y]</code>. That also makes it easier and more obvious to access a neighboring button: <code>buttonsGrid[x + 1][y]</code> gives you the button directly to the right. You'll need to guard against invalid coordinates, so write a few helper methods:</p>

<pre><code>private bool IsValidCoordinate(int x, int y)
{
    return x &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; x &lt; BoardWidth &amp;&amp; y &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; y &lt; BoardHeight;
}

private void SetButtonColor(int x, int y, Color color)
{
    if (!IsValidCoordinate(x, y))
        return;

    buttonsGrid[x][y].ForeColor = color;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, instead of having a method that places exactly 4 mines, it's better to have a method that places 1 mine. If you want to add more mines, you would simply call that method multiple times:</p>

<pre><code>private void AddMine(int x, int y)
{
    SetButtonColor(x, y, Color.Red);

    SetButtonColor(x - 1, y, Color.Orange);
    SetButtonColor(x, y - 1, Color.Orange);
    SetButtonColor(x + 1, y, Color.Orange);
    SetButtonColor(x, y + 1, Color.Orange);
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, the above method could accidentally overwrite existing mines. One way to solve that is to check that a button isn't red before overwriting its color, so a <code>GetButtonColor</code> method would be useful.</p>

<hr>

<p>One issue here is that it's still using UI elements to store actual game state. That not only ties the game heavily to a specific UI, it also results in code that's harder to understand. It's better to have a grid of <code>Tile</code> objects, where each <code>Tile</code> contains information such as whether it's a mine, how many mines are nearby, whether it's been uncovered by the player or marked with a flag, and so on. Something like <code>tile.HasMine</code> or <code>tile.IsFlagged</code> is much more self-explanatory than <code>tile.ForeColor == Color.Red</code> or <code>tile.ForeColor == Color.Black</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Other improvements would be to generate buttons based on the tile grid, which makes it easier to support different board sizes. It may also be a good idea to store tile coordinates in a buttons <code>Tag</code> property, so you can quickly look up the associated tile:</p>

<pre><code>button.Tag = new Point(x, y);
...
if (button.Tag is Point position)
{
    var tile = GetTile(position.X, position.Y);
    if (tile.IsMine)
        ...
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Other notes:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Regions can be useful to group related things together, but that's often a sign that classes might be doing too many different thing. Surrounding every method with a region only clutters the code.</li>
<li>Use comments to explain things that the code itself cannot tell you, such as why you decided to do something the way you did, or how or for what purpose a method is intended to be used, or certain gotcha's that a caller should be aware of. Repeating method names is not useful.</li>
<li>I'd rename <code>Win</code> to <code>CheckWinCondition</code> - it more accurately describes what the method does.</li>
<li><code>string.Format("button{0}", id)</code> can be written more succinctly with an interpolated string: <code>$"button{id}"</code>.</li>
</ul>

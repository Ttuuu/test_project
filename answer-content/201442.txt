<p>The other two answers are good. I'll just throw in a few other ideas:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It's a bit long, and your algorithm is fundamentally a few steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>figure out semitone from A</li>
<li>calculate octave 4 frequency</li>
<li>adjust for active</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, your main function would be clearer if simply:</p>

<pre><code>int semitone     = calculateSemitone(note);
double frequency = calculateA4freqency(semitone);
double final     = adjustForOctave(frequency, note[3]);  
return final
</code></pre>

<p>You need just a couple of the 8 constants/temporary variables in your main function, so it's easier to follow.</p></li>
<li><p>By separating out the flat/sharp variables, you've introduced two additional variables and <code>if</code> statements, which require 10 <code>if</code> statements to interpret. This adds to the 7 cases of the switch statement, for a rough complexity of 19 (2 + 10 + 7). If you don't have these variables, you can write a switch statement that handles the note itself: 'C', 'C#', 'Db', etc. This will be (I believe) 12 branches, therefore simpler. It will also be clearer from this how to make "table-driven" code per the other responses above.</p></li>
<li><p>At first, I thought that if you instead base off of A0 (or C0), instead of A4, your octave calculation can be simpler-- instead of the if/elseif/else it can actually just be a single calculation. But upon further reflection, you can stick with your A4 if you trust the math to do the right thing... I believe you will find that <code>octave = pow(2, (octave - 4)); final = round(frequency * octave);</code> works correctly whether octave is &lt;4, ==4 or &gt;4. Try it!</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This is a good first step, but it's always good to read back over and try to have each function do one thing, ideally with a clear input and output. Once you have smaller functions, it's easier to make them clean and readable.</p>

<p>Just have the time to take a quick view on your code, but one of the first thing you have to learn to do (before using design pattern and such things), is to refactor your code.</p>

<p>By simply scrolling, we can see <code>df_additional[col]</code> more than ten times. For all the places where you just need to read this value, use a local variable to store it. If you need to write it, in that case leave it.</p>

<p>There is also <code>df_additional = pd.concat([df_additional.iloc[:, :loc_col], df_additional_one_hot, df_additional.iloc[:, loc_col:]], axis=1).drop(col, axis=1)</code> a couple of time, with just a local variable used as a parameter which changes between those calls. Maybe you can also refactor that?</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that if your <code>if</code> (or whatever loop or control statement) begins to be long (dozen of lines), and even more when you have several <code>if</code> like that, think about isolating each block in a separate function. Or at least all the complete <code>if</code>/<code>elif</code> block in a function.</p>

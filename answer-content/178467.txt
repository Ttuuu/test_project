<p>I think the problem with a lot of the solutions in this thread is that they don't mention the problem space in the code, variable names help signal intent</p>

<pre><code>$upper_clamp = $value &gt; 4;
$upper_clamp &amp;&amp; $value = 4;

$lower_clamp = $value &lt; 0;
$lower_clamp &amp;&amp; $value = 0;
</code></pre>

<p>If you want the micro optimisation of not checking the second case you could do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>switch (TRUE) {
  case $upper_clamp = $value &gt; 4: 
    return 4;
  case $lower_clamp = $value &lt; 0:
    return 0;
  default: 
    return $value;
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Just because if statements and switch statements etc allow you to not use a variable name doesn't mean you should not use one, they can help understanding of code.</p>

<p>Writing code with missing variable names is like writing a novel where you describe everything that is happening but skip writing any describing words</p>

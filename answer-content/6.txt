<p>You might also look into the built-in php command mysql_pconnect().  This differs from mysql_connect in that it opens a persistent connection to the DB the first time it is called, and each subsequent time, it checks to see if an existing connection to that database exists and uses that connection instead.  You should then remove the mysql_close command from the destructor, as they will persist between page loads.</p>

<p>At a glance: that function is way too long and deeply nested. Three levels of loop/branch nesting is, in my experience, the most that any function should have; and the more nested it is the shorter it should be. </p>

<p>Consider extracting branch and loop bodies to separate named functions.</p>

<p>Your code structure also seems to be “determine what command to execute” (add / list / etc), then “execute said command”. I’d make this explicit, have the regexp parsing of an input line in a separate function that returns the command type and parameters. Dispatching this would be a natural use for <code>match</code> over your own Command type. (That said, in a realistic CLI you might need the commands available to be extensible so don’t get too married to this pattern. I’m guessing you’ll get to dynamic polymorphism later in the book.)</p>

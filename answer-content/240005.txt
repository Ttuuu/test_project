<h2>Encryption is not enough</h2>

<p>In addition to your eventual encryption, you need to take measures to protect your data at the operating system level. At the least, make sure that the permissions are restrictive - this is possible on Windows, MacOS and Linux using various methods.</p>

<h2>Sets</h2>

<p><code>VALID_MASTER_PASS_ANSWERS</code> and <code>VALID_ACTIONS</code> should be sets. Also, just store the lower-case versions of your answers, and convert input to lower-case for the purposes of case-insensitive comparison. As for valid actions, they're all integers - so store them as integers, and convert your input to an integer.</p>

<p>The case and set suggestions also apply to</p>

<pre><code>if has_master_password in ("Y", "y", "Yes", "yes"):
</code></pre>

<h2>Password strength</h2>

<p>Length is not enough. Do a basic English word pass at the least. Since this is specifically a password management program you might want to do something more thorough like entropy measurement - there are libraries for this.</p>

<h2>Redundant return</h2>

<p>Drop the <code>return</code> from this:</p>

<pre><code>    except AttributeError:
        print(f"{name} could not be found!")
        return
</code></pre>

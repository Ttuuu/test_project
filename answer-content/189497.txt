<p>I will assume that the argument <code>full_name</code> (which would be better named <code>fullName</code>) is always a string as that is what your code implies.</p>

<p>Also assuming that undefined names are to be set to <code>""</code> (empty string) and that all middle names are to be concatenated to a single string separated with spaces.</p>

<p>Rename properties removing the "name" part as that is implied by what the object is holding.</p>

<p>You don't need to store the result object, just return it directly.</p>

<p>The resulting function</p>

<pre><code>ProcessFullName(fullName): Object { 
    const names = fullName.split(" ");
    const vet = name =&gt; name ? name : "";
    return {
        first:  vet(names.shift()),
        last:   vet(names.pop()),
        middle: vet(names.join(" "))
    };

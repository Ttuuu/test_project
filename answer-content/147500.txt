<li>Write <code>i++</code> instead of <code>++i</code>. While they are completely equivalent to the compiler, the former style is much more common. (Using the latter style tells the informed reader that you come from a C++ background and you don't trust the compiler to generate efficient code no matter how you write it.)</li>

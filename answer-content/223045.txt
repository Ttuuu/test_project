<p>You have implemented a bathroom that can be occupied by only one type of genital at a time. Therefore it is not a unisex bathroom but a monosex bathroom.</p>

<p>You have labelled sex as "man" and "woman" which are genders. From what I understand the terms you are looking for here are "penis" and "vagina".</p>

<p>The code only identifies entrants as "men" hile all others are gategorized as "women". That is flaw, since the code allows all types of Strings to enter the bathroom. For example "M's that identify as F's". You need to have an unlimited amount of conditions for all self-identified Strings that may want to enter the monosex bathroom or implement some sort of genital inspection and gategorization proxy including an N-to-N mapping of which identities can use the bathroom at the same time.</p>

<p>Please note that <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/conduct">StackExchange</a> "does not tolerate any language likely to offend or alienate people based on race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion — and those are just a few examples. When in doubt, just don’t."</p>

<p>If you want an inclusive version of this problem, implement a "watering hole" that can only be entered by animals in the "predator" and "prey" categories at a given time.</p>

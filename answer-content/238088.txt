<p>Have you run a profiler on your code?  It would help identify where the code is spending most of its time.  If I had to guess, I would say the A* search is taking up most of the time for larger mazes.  Try using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill" rel="nofollow noreferrer">flood fill</a> algorithm instead.  If all the empty squares don't change to the same color, then a move has created two disconnected areas and the move is unsafe.</p>

<p>I also don't think you need to check every move to see if it is safe.  Only check when a move is likely to be unsafe.  For example, the current tile isn't touching a wall (or used tile), but the next tile would be touching.</p>

<p>Pre-calculate all possible moves for small groups of tiles may help. Say 2x2, 2X3, 3x3, ... 5x6, etc. Then use them to try to solve a smaller maze.</p>

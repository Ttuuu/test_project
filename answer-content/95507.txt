<p>Why on Earth are you storing <code>fullJustify</code> as a function in the class <code>Solution</code>? In fact, the class <code>solution</code> serves no purpose whatsoever. It can be removed.</p>

<p>Secondly, function names and variable names should be in the style <code>snake_case</code>, not <code>camelCase</code>. Classes should be in <code>PascalCase</code>.</p>

<p>The three comments above the function <code>Solution.fullJustify</code>, should be stored in a docstring. Here's how you could convert those comments.</p>

<pre><code>def full_justify(words, max_width):
    """
    words     - string[]
    max_width - integer
    returns  - string[]
    """
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>This line can be shortened from <code>len_of_line = len_of_line + len(words[runner])</code> to <code>len_of_line += len(words[runner])</code>. There are other places you could do this. This syntax also supports other operators, like <code>*</code>, or <code>/</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, I find it to be clearer to declare variables on separate lines. For example, the line <code>len_of_line, word_num_line = 0, 0</code> would become two separate lines, <code>len_of_line = 0</code>, and <code>word_num_line = 0</code>.</p>

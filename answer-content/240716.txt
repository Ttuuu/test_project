  <p>So I am wondering if there is a proper more correct way to do it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>binary data</strong></p>

<p>An encryption of a file should not assume it is text lacking a <code>'\0'</code>.  As a binary file, data may include <em>null characters</em> which will incorrectly copy using <code>strncpy()</code>.</p>

<pre><code>// strncpy(msg, plaintext + start, end - start);
memcpy(msg, plaintext + start, end - start);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>LARGE files</strong></p>

<p>"for large files (ex. 1GB)" --&gt; 1GB is not so large.  Rather than limit file size to the <code>int</code> range, use <code>size_t</code>.  That is typicality at least 2x the positive range or perhaps billions x.  Code is limited in design to <code>size_t</code> given the usage of a single array.   Might as well use as much range as possible.</p>

<pre><code>size_t start;
... 
// int end = (start + 32);
size_t end = (start + 32);
</code></pre>

<p>Better code would use <code>unsigned long long</code> like the <code>int crypto_aead_decrypt(unsigned char* m, unsigned long long* mlen, ...)</code> signature.</p>

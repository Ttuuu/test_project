<p>nope! [grin]   </p>

<p>this is almost entirely about style, not performance. you will note that most points are about readability ... the following line is quite true ...     </p>

<p><strong><em>better readability gives better understanding gives better maintainability.</em></strong>    </p>

<p>[1] never use aliases or short names in a script that will be shared or reused<br>
why? code is READ far more often than written, so make it easy to read.    </p>

<p>[2] use consistent indents<br>
your indentation makes it needlessly unclear where each stage begins and ends. see [1] for why that is important.    </p>

<p>[3] you need comments describing the purpose of the code<br>
again, someone who reads your code next month [perhaps you] needs some sort of idea as to the intent of your code.    </p>

<p>[4] avoid long lines<br>
you have two lines that run well off to the right. since PoSh <em>knows</em> that things like pipe symbols WILL be followed by more stuff, you can wrap after such. that also applies to commas, open parens, and other such "more to come" items.    </p>

<p>why bother? once again, it is about <em>reading</em>. there is a reason why most wide-format publications to use multiple columns ... people tend to read more comfortably when the lines require minimal side-to-side eye movement. that works out to about 80 to 100 chars per line.    </p>

<p>make use of the <em>vertical</em> space you have available. folks scan vertically somewhat more easily than horizontally.    </p>

<p>[5] use consistent variable case<br>
you use <code>lowercase</code> and <code>PascalCase</code>. try to stick with ONE such style ... and <code>PascalCase</code> is the one usually recommended.    </p>

<p>[6] read the officially referenced <em>unofficial</em> style &amp; best practices guide<br>
this ...   </p>

â€” <a href="https://github.com/PoshCode/PowerShellPracticeAndStyle" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/PoshCode/PowerShellPracticeAndStyle</a>    </p>

<p>[7] remove unused code<br>
you define <code>$Result</code> ... but never use it. i would remove that.    </p>

<p>[8] define the type for your parameter<br>
your <code>$FolderName</code> parameter type is not defined. i suspect it is <code>[string]</code>, tho.    </p>

<p>[9] avoid sending things across a pipe if you can<br>
you send <code>$_</code> to <code>Get-NetFirewallApplicationFilter</code> via a pipe. pipeline ops are slower than direct ops &amp; it looks like you could call that out by using the parameter name directly.    </p>

<hr>

<p>here's how i would rework your code layout ...  </p>

<pre><code>Param (
    [Parameter(
        Mandatory)]
        [string]
        $FolderName
    )

Get-NetFirewallRule |
    Where-Object {
        $_.Direction -eq "Outbound" -and
        $_.DisplayName -like "*appcontainer*"
        } |
    ForEach-Object {
        # i wonder if the next two lines could be done as 
        #    Get-NetFirewallApplicationFilter -AssociatedNetFirewallRule $_
        $_ |
        Get-NetFirewallApplicationFilter | 
        ForEach-Object {
            $Acl = Get-Acl $FolderName
            $Sec= New-Object System.Security.Principal.SecurityIdentifier($_.Package)
            $AccessRule = New-Object System.Security.AccessControl.FileSystemAccessRule(
                $Sec,
                "FullControl",
                (1 -bor 2),
                0,
                "Allow"
                )
            $Acl.SetAccessRule($AccessRule)
            $Acl |
                Set-Acl $FolderName
            } # end 2nd FE-O
        } # end 1st FE-O

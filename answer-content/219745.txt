<li><p>NEVER use <code>using namespace std</code>. It can cause hard tracked bugs. Read here why: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1452721/why-is-using-namespace-std-considered-bad-practice">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1452721/why-is-using-namespace-std-considered-bad-practice</a></p></li>
<li><p>The code has WAY to much comments. "Well commented" does not mean that it should have tons of comments. I have seen well commented code without comments. A problem with comments is that you need to maintain them. Will you remember to change comments when you change the code? Probably not. An example of a completely useless comment is <code>minHeap-&gt;size = 0; // Setting the size to 0</code>. You have a variable called <code>size</code> and you're assigning it to the value <code>0</code>. There's no need for a comment there.</p></li>
<li><p>If you're coding C++, then code C++. No reason to use <code>malloc</code> in C++, because this language has far easier and secure methods for allocating memory.</p></li>

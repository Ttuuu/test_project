<p>Your code is difficult to read, there are no comments to explain what the code is doing, or how it’s doing it.</p>
<p>Using typedefs would also add explanations to the purpose of the code.</p>
<p>More verbose variable names would also help, dp doesn’t mean anything.</p>
<p>To me it looks like you have ported the code without understanding what it is doing, which has its place, but if you don’t understand it then how is anyone else meant to?</p>

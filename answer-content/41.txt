<p>I don't think it makes any difference in regards to connecting to the database within the construction or within a connect method, what i do think you need to change is those die commands.</p>

<p>using die causes the script to halt and send 1 little message to the user, who would think this is rubbish, and never visit your site again :( :(</p>

<p>What you should be doing is catching your errors, and redirecting to a static page where you can show a very nice message to the user, fully apologising for the technical issues your having.</p>

<p>You can also have an box that says, Enter your email address and we will email you when were back on line, you get the idea.</p>

<p>as for the code I would go down the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>class Database
{
    public function __construct($autoconnect = false)
    {
        //Here you would 'globalize' your config and set it locally as a reference.
        if($autoconnect === true)
        {
             $this-&gt;connect();
        }
    }

    public function connect()
    {
        if($this-&gt;connected() === false)
        {
             $result = $this-&gt;driver-&gt;sendCommand("connect");
             if($result === true)
             {
                  $this-&gt;setConnectionState("active");
                  $this-&gt;setConnectionResource($this-&gt;driver-&gt;sendCommand("get_resource"));
             }else
             {
                 throw new DatabaseConnectionError($this-&gt;driver-&gt;sendCommand("getDriverError"));
             }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This gives you more functionality in the long run as every action is decidable within your APP, nothing is auto fired on default.</p>

<p>you can simple use try,catch blocks to maintain your error reporting.</p>

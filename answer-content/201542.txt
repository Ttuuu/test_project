<p>If you ask for specific questions, we can provide better feedback. </p>

<p>A few thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li>if you're including jQuery, go ahead and use it for DOM generation, as it will be much more concise and readable, instead of all the bulky <code>createElement</code>, <code>setAttribute</code> code. And the event handlers can be done through jQuery a little nicer.</li>
<li>if you're allowed, you have good names for the functions in the comments, and I'd use them. For example, <code>listItem</code> would be more clearly <code>buildListItem</code>; <code>ordering._dom.list</code> would probably be better <code>buildExistingOrdersTable</code> (it's not a list!). I would find <code>buildSubmitButton</code> clearer than <code>ordering._dom.submit</code>.</li>
</ul>

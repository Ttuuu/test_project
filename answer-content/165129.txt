<p>Your code will invoke undefined behavior when you feed it some character outside the <em>basic execution character set</em>, e.g. UTF-8 text. When your compiler defines <code>char</code> to have the same range as <code>signed char</code>, these characters are represented as negative numbers. Passing a negative number to the functions from <code>&lt;cctype&gt;</code> is only allowed for the special value <code>EOF</code>.</p>

<p>You should fix that bug, but don't worry that you didn't know about it before. I think less than 5% of the C programmers know this, and it is too easy to get wrong.</p>

<p>To fix this bug, call <code>std::isprint(uint8_t(buffer[i]))</code>.</p>

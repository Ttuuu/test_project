<p>I'm assuming that the code works as intended.</p>

<p>Firstly, let me tell you that your code looks very pythonic - this is a huge plus.</p>

<h1>My comments:</h1>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>You state that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have a dict that may be 'infinitely' nested </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Keep in mind that since you seem to be doing recursive calls your <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/3323013/3809977">stack is limited</a> hence is your ability to retrive nested dict. </p>

<p><strong>map_keys_by_type</strong> </p>

<p>Argument <code>d</code> is not informative, try using <code>dic</code> (if you want to follow your change <code>type</code>-&gt;<code>typ</code>) or <code>dictionary</code>. </p>

<p>Although, this is not extreamly important you might consider changing <code>p</code> to something more informative. When I've read the code first time I almost immediacy forgot what this variable stands for. However, as I said this is not very important because the function is small. </p>

<p><strong>nested_get</strong></p>

<p>This bit</p>

<pre><code>for k in nested_key:
    internal_dict_value = internal_dict_value.get(k, None)
    if internal_dict_value is None:
        return None
</code></pre>

<p>in my opinion would be clearer if you did:</p>

<pre><code>if k not in internal_dict_value:
    return None
else:
    internal_dict_value = internal_dict_value[k]
</code></pre>

<p><code>not in</code> shows your intention directly.</p>

<p>Everything else looks okay for me. </p>

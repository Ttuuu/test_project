<p>There is nothing inherently wrong with using <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code>, just as there would be nothing wrong with using <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code>. Whatever collection type you choose to accept or return is far more a matter of your application's needs than any style guide.</p>

<p>For example, if you were writing a public-facing API, you would likely want to be most permissible in what you accept in order to make it easy for clients to use that API. In that case, using <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> would allow any collection type (including arrays) to be passed to your methods.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you were writing high-performance code that is internal to your application, you'd probably use <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> and pass it between your (presumably private) methods (using concrete types is slightly faster than interfaces).</p>

<p>Remember that style guides are just that - <strong>guides</strong>. It's up to you the programmer to apply those guidelines intelligently and logically.</p>

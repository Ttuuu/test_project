<h3>Review</h3>

<ul>
<li>The postfix <code>AtIndex</code> is too verbose. You don't have any other operations like <code>AtMask</code> or anything and the <code>index</code> is provided as argument. So I would prefer <code>IsBitSet</code> over <code>IsBitSetAtIndex</code> etc.</li>
<li>The index is sometimes a <code>byte</code>, sometimes a <code>uint</code>. I would not bother with such level of (over-)engineered type picks. Stick with the common type for an index <code>int</code>. You can always add argument checks for bounds.</li>
<li>You can replace <code>1 &lt;&lt; 7 - index</code> with <code>1 &lt;&lt; index</code> in your operations. This is written more compactly and is a well known bit operation technique. Right-to-left indexes are more common in bitwise systems.</li>
</ul>

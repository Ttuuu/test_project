<p>I think you should change the way a user inputs their decision. For example, look at these lines:</p>

<pre><code>print("You are in the middle of the castle.")
print("Where do you want to go?")
time.sleep(3)
print("1.) North Hall")
print("2.) East Hall")
print("3.) South Hall")
print("4.) West Hall")
mid = input("")
if mid == 1:
    north()
</code></pre>

<p>The first time I ran the program, I did this:</p>

<pre><code>You are in the middle of the castle.
Where do you want to go?
1.) North Hall
2.) East Hall
3.) South Hall
4.) West Hall
North Hall
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>I also tried entering the number one too, but it didn't work. You need to add quotes around the code like this:</p>

<pre><code>if mid == '1':
    north()
elif mid == '2':
    east()
elif mid == '3':
    south()
elif mid == '4':
    west()
</code></pre>

<p>or:</p>

<pre><code>mid = int(input(""))
</code></pre>
    </div>

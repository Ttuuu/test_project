<p>This is a good example for demonstrating that you can implement factory pattern without conditional statements. Of course, no piece of code is good for every imaginable requirement.</p>

<p>In real world cases factory pattern usually needed because some aspect of the object building is not trivial. One such case is when you do not have the concrete classes at compile time. e.g. when you are a library/framework developer and the user will have the concrete classes. In that case you would want to externalize the class names to the program configuration. This program requires that you have the <code>SubmitButton.class</code> et al at compile time, and is  dependent of those concrete classes.</p>

<p>Your algorithm is nearly "selection sort" (see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm" rel="nofollow">wikipedia entry on sorting algorithms</a>).  </p>

<p>You could make it more efficient by doing the true selection sort:  during the <code>j</code>-loop, you do not swap every time you find a value smaller than the <code>i</code>-value, but rather you just use the loop to find the minimal value to the right of the <code>i</code>-value and only after the <code>j</code>-loop is done do you swap, if needed.</p>

<p>Also, for efficiency, you should just swap the values by using a temporary variable (see Guffa's code for example) instead adding and subtracting bits of the numbers in-place.</p>

<p>But it would even better to implement the true bubble sort, or some inherently faster algorithm.  Again, take a look at the wikipedia link.</p>

<p>In addition to the comments by Joachim, I would suggest getting rid of the <code>api_url</code> member variable, and change your <code>build()</code> function to return a <code>String</code>.</p>

<p>I think that this class also needs some documenting comments to make it clear that you can have a city name, or a city ID, or lat/long, but if you try to use more than one, then the last one will overwrite the earlier ones.</p>

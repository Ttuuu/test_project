<p>When you have multiple conditions on the same value, then you should chain the conditions using <code>else if</code>. For example in most in most of the conditions on <code>settings. animation</code>.</p>

<p>Also, since your checks on <code>settings.animation</code> are highly repetitive for left, right, top, bottom, it would be better to rewrite with a loop.</p>

<hr>

<p>Instead of this:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>position = position + settings.distance;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>It's more compact to write like this:</p>

<pre><code>position += settings.distance;
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Other than these minor issues, the code seems fine.</p>

<p>Welcome to CodeReview! This isn't great code, but that doesn't mean that this is a bad question. I think that you've come to the right place.</p>

<h2>Recursion</h2>

<pre><code>    if color == "":
        print("No skipping!")
        print(check(input("Enter Name Here&gt;&gt;&gt; ")))
</code></pre>

<p>This uses recursion when it shouldn't. In other words, <code>check</code> is calling itself needlessly, and if the user tries to "skip" enough times, you'll get a stack overflow. Instead of doing this, just loop until you have valid input.</p>

<h2>Fake delays</h2>

<pre><code>    print("Calculating...")
    sleep(2.5)
</code></pre>

<p>Few things bother me more than when a user interface lies to me. This output suggests that it takes 2.5 seconds for a calculation to be done, but that simply isn't so. Don't lie to your users - just show the results.</p>

<p><code>sleep(100)</code> is actively harmful - the user needs to Ctrl+C to kill the program; otherwise it sits there preventing the user from getting their shell terminal back. This should just be deleted.</p>

<h2>Don't repeat yourself</h2>

<p>There are many places in the program that are expressed in a repetitive manner, especially user input (the "no skipping" mechanism), the call to <code>count</code>, and the additions to get <code>total</code>. I suggest the following:</p>

<pre><code>def input_without_skip(prompt: str) -&gt; str:
    while True:
        result = input(f'{prompt}&gt;&gt;&gt;')
        if result:
            return result
        print('No skipping!')


def is_master() -&gt; bool:
    return input_without_skip('Enter Name Here') == 'Hercules'


def get_counts():
    for question, prompt, chars in (
        (     'What is your favorite color?',   'fav_color', 'g'),
        (          'What is your dream car?',     'fav_car', 'g'),
        (            'What team are you on?',   'team_name', 'g'),
        (         'Who is your best friend?', 'best_friend', 'g'),
        (        'What color is your shirt?', 'shirt_color', 'g'),
        (                   'You got clout?', 'clout_level', 'y10'),
        ('Do you think you passed the test?',     'passed?', 'y')
    ):
        print(question)
        answer = input_without_skip(prompt)
        yield sum(answer.count(c) for c in chars)


def main():
    if is_master():
        print('Welcome home, master.')
        return

    print("Let's find some data!")
    total = sum(get_counts())

    if total &gt; 1:
        print("passed")
    else:
        print("failed")
    print("Congrats on your result!")


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

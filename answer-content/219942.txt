<p>Just curious, but if the values list appears as a delimited collection, could you not just strip out the commas and split on the 1's to make an array and then reduce that? I haven't worked in python in 15 years (edit: updated to python) but this code seems to work:</p>

<pre><code># importing functools for reduce() 
import functools 

# initializing list 
inputString = "1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0"

#remove commas and split result into an array using 1 as the delimiter
inputString = inputString.replace(",", "")
resultArr = inputString.split("1");

# using reduce to compute maximum element from resulting array list 
longestString = (functools.reduce(lambda a,b : a if a &gt;= b else b,resultArr)) 

#output the result
print ("The maximum element of the list is : ",end="") 
print (len(longestString)) 
</code></pre>
    </div>

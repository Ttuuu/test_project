<p>The <code>mov     cx, 36</code> in QN is not as nice as I'd wish. I don't have a better way in mind though.</p>

<p>(To be fair, <a href="https://hg.ulukai.org/ecm/quine/file/eac01194cb9a/q.asm#l30" rel="nofollow noreferrer">in my q.asm</a> I assume that there are two linebreak characters, that LF is the second one each time, and that there is a linebreak at the very end of the string. If I were to write it now I would at least use <code>jb loop</code> instead of <code>jne</code>.)</p>

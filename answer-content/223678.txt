<p>The call to <code>System.out.println</code>, which is an expensive operation, is performed every time the mouse is dragged. Every position change will print a line. The faster a position changes the faster it will print.</p>

<p>Deleting this print call should fix the problem and make the console info more useful.</p>

<p>A minimum difference condition to allow the call to print could also solve the problem.</p>

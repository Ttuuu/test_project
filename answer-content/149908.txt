<p>We can't know why your interviewer rejected your application, but these types of questions are often starting points for conversation--not finished product endpoints. If you write the <em>simplest</em>, most straightforward code you can, you and your interviewer can then talk about things like expansion, generalization, and performance.</p>

<p>Your interviewer knows that asking you to change your function interface is more problematic because you'll also have to change all your [unasked for] unit tests. This slows down the process and might make the interviewer worry that you'll pollute their codebase with a lot of brittle code.</p>

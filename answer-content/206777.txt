<p>I agree with most of what <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/152338/59161">@Emily L.</a> commented, all good comments. The only exception is for the <code>mHead</code> and <code>mTail</code> <code>padding/false</code> sharing case. If the use scenario is to have two threads on different cores, it makes sense to have them in different cache lines to avoid false sharing in theory. Of course, profile and measurement in real run is the best way to check the performance.</p>

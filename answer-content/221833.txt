<p>Apart from the functional improvements that were already presented to you, there are also a few non-functional facets that could be improved.</p>

<p>Python has an official <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Style Guide</a>, often just called PEP8. This guide presents a variety of recommendations to write consistent and good looking Python code.</p>

<p>IMGO the points most relevant to your code would be:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sort the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports" rel="nofollow noreferrer">imports</a>. Standard library imports come first, followed by third-party libraries, and eventually local import from other Python files you have written.</li>
<li>Write proper <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#documentation-strings" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation strings</a>. The officially recommended docstring syntax is to enclose them in <code>"""triple quotes"""</code> and place them immediately below the function definition. Apart from a unified style with most of the Python coding world, this will also make sure that Python's built-in <code>help(...)</code> function as well as most proper Python IDEs will easily pick it up and show it to you.</li>
<li>Use 4 spaces per <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#indentation" rel="nofollow noreferrer">indentation</a> level. There is an overindented block in the body of the <code>if</code> statement in <code>import_data</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are a lot of tools that may help you to keep a consistent style even on a larger scale. Some of these tools would be <a href="https://pylint.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pylint</a> (style and static code checking), <a href="http://flake8.pycqa.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">flake8</a>, <a href="https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">black</a> (style check and auto-formatting), or <a href="https://github.com/google/yapf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">yapf</a> (style check and auto-formatting) to name a few. Most Python IDEs support at least some of these tools so they will mark violating pieces of code while you write them and not just afterwards.</p>

<p>That's too complicated a solution.</p>

<p>It also not only imposes an arbitrary limit on the maximum possible input line length, it fails to check that the input doesn't exceed this limit.</p>

<p>80 is the only significant number in this program.
There's no need to worry about anything more than that.</p>

<p>Simply get characters into an 80 character buffer.</p>

<p>If you get '\n' before it fills, empty the buffer.</p>

<p>Otherwise, print the full buffer and get and print characters until the next '\n'.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Lucas-Lehmer_test#GMP" rel="nofollow noreferrer">GMP code on RosettaCode</a> is about 2x faster if you're looking for performance improvements.</p>

<p>It has a reasonable number of comments explaining the various optimizations.  Most of the help will be in the pre-tests, where we know easy ways to find out if the result will be composite.  The test itself is not too dissimilar, with a few different choices made.</p>

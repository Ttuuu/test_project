<p>First, <em>please please please</em> use Java naming conventions to aid readability. Methods and local variables like <code>int Hours</code> should be in <code>camelCase</code> and not <code>CapitalCase</code> which is for classes. Statements like this: </p>

<pre><code>boolean AnalyzeData(String GpsData){
</code></pre>

<p>are especially confusing. Is <code>GpsData</code> referring to the local variable, or the class? That can get very nasty very quickly. Please fix this before you do anything else.</p>

<pre><code>final class GpsData {
</code></pre>

<p>This does not do what I suspect you think it does. A <code>final</code> declaration for a class just means it can't be further extended. Its data can still be modified. To properly encapsulate the properties of <code>GpsData</code> you should declare each of those properties as <code>private</code> and provide <code>public</code> constructors, setters, and getters as appropriate.</p>

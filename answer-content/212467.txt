<p>Ok, first experiments/test show that this does exactly what it says on the tin: it finds strongly connected (groups of) nodes, or -- in my non-expert parlance -- where the cycles are in a directed graph.</p>

<p>Cannot say much about performance, as the use case I am dealing with involves analysing small-ish graphs (a few dozen nodes at most). Just wondering why your solution doesn't use the Traverser that guava/google graph ships.</p>

<p>Also, noticed that you explicitly forbid self-loops, yet when I analyse a Graph with a self-loop in it, it all works wonderfully well (the self-loop is identified as a cycle Set of one).</p>

<p>In short, thanks very much for helping me out of a pickle</p>

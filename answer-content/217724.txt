<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>In your <code>isRevealed</code> method, you're using the <code>count</code> algorithm, which believes that you are interested in knowing the exact number of letters, whereas you just want to know if it is present at least once. More, you are making two complete passesover the letters where a partial pass stopping at the first occurrence would suffice. You could rewrite your function body as:</p>

<pre><code>const auto lowerCaseS = tolower(s);
return std::any(revealed.begin(), revealed.end(), [&amp;](char c) { return tolower(c) == lowerCaseS; });
</code></pre>

<p>In your <code>createUnreveal</code> function, you are actually trying to create a string composed of <code>_</code> alone, that has the same length as <code>theWord</code>. Your function could be simplified as:</p>

<pre><code>unrevealed = std::string{theWord.length(), '_'};
</code></pre>
    </div>

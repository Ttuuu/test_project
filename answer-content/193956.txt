<p>Your first version is unreliable if there are numbers that consist of more than one digit. For example, the method <code>usingString(int[])</code> would count only two distinct numbers in the array <code>[1, 2, 12]</code>, and only one distinct number in the array <code>[12, 1, 2]</code>.</p>

<p>Apart from that, you could also use a stream:</p>

<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>static int countDistinctIntegers(int[] array) {
    return (int) Arrays.stream(array).distinct().count();
}
</code></pre>

<p>I think this better represents the intention behind the code than using a <code>Map</code> (or a <code>Set</code>, which, I agree, is more appropriate than a <code>Map</code> here), because collecting the elements to a <code>Collection</code> is not an aim per se, but just a means to accomplish something else, whereas the stream describes exactly what you want to do, seeing as streams are meant to represent operations on data as opposed to storage of data.</p>

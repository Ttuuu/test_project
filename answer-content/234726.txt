<p>Issues Sharon Ben Asher did not mention:</p>

<p>Because you're not using the index variable i to anything other than indexing the array you should use the for-each variant of the for loop to make the code cleaner. LinkedList is the wrong data type. Since you're only adding and never modifying the list and know the size you should use an ArrayList with correct initial size. Variables that are not changed should be marked final:</p>

<pre><code>final List&lt;Person&gt; personsList = new ArrayList(persons.length);

for (Person person: persons) {
    personsList.add(person);
}
</code></pre>

<p>(Or better yet use the Arrays.asList for this particular use case).</p>

<p>The totalAge field is pointlessly volatile. It is accessed only in the constructor which means it can only ever be accessed by one thread.</p>

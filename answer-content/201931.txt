<h1>Cache DOM selectors</h1>

<p>You select the target container over and over again. You should get it once outside the function, cache it in a variable and reuse it:</p>

<pre><code>const target = document.getElementById('quotes');
</code></pre>

<h1>Naming</h1>

<p>Try to use descriptive names instead of <code>myarray</code>, <code>myVar</code> and <code>quote</code>:</p>

<pre><code>const quotes = [];
function changeQuoteRandomly() {}
</code></pre>

<h1>Style</h1>

<p>It's easier to read, if you use single quotes on the strings, as you don't have to escape the double quotes:</p>

<pre><code>quotes.push('"Important words" by Someone');
</code></pre>

<p>You sometimes use a semicolon at the end of the line and sometimes you don't â€“ use only one way and be consistent:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>var myarray = []
var myVar = setInterval(quote, 15000);
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>I would prefer using <code>push</code> to add elements to the array instead of setting the index manually. Or you could even add all elements during initialization:</p>

<pre><code>const quotes = [
    '"Important words" by Someone',
    '"Other important words" by Someone'
];
</code></pre>

<p>Both ways make it easier to re-arrange elements later as you don't have to keep track of the index yourself.</p>

<h1>Semantics</h1>

<p>Currently your markup looks like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>&lt;div id="quotes"&gt;
    "The single best piece of advice: Constantly think about how you could be doing things better and questioning yourself."&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt; Elon Musk&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>You could improve this, by using <code>blockquote</code>, <code>cite</code> and even <code>figure</code> elements. Here you can find more infos and examples on W3C: <a href="http://w3c.github.io/html/grouping-content.html#the-blockquote-element" rel="nofollow noreferrer">4.4.5. The blockquote element</a>.</p>

<h1>User experience</h1>

<p>While this is a nice addition on your website, there are a few downsides:</p>

<ul>
<li>There's no introduction to this section, the visitor has no clue why you're showing them. Try to relate them to your business.</li>
<li>The first quote is shown after 15s, until then only an empty blue container ist visible.</li>
<li>15s between quotes is a really long time. There's no indicator that more is coming, so there's a great chance that a user will not see a second one.</li>
</ul>

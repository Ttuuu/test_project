<p>Thanks for sharing this.
Looks fine for me. If you have free time think about possibility to make this game more flexible, maybe not only 3x3 but 5x5, 7x7? That would a be great exercise.</p>

<p>I thought about it when I saw this hard-coded values. You should avoid any kind of hard-coding values.</p>

<pre><code>if (!between(tileNumber, 1, 9)) {
       return false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Next, you probably check the same thing 2x.
In you <code>getTileNumber</code> function you check number by using function <code>between</code> (I would think about better name for this), and in <code>setTile</code> you are checking this one more time.</p>

<pre><code>    int tileNumber = getTileNumber(player);
    if (grid.setTile(isX, tileNumber)) {
        break;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>You have multiple occurrences of <code>std::cout</code> etc. You could think of some special class that would be responsible for such task, <code>GameLogger</code>?</p>

<p>I personally use <code>and</code>, <code>or</code> instead of <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code> but it is a matter of taste.</p>

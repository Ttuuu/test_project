<p>Welcome to Code Review!</p>

<p><strong>Bad naming</strong></p>

<p>The method doesn't actually check that a URL is valid, as it allows values that are not URLs. Thus it should not be named as "isValidURL". It should be <code>isValidAddress</code> or similar, but not URL. URLs have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL#Syntax" rel="nofollow noreferrer">very well defined syntax</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Unnecessary variables</strong></p>

<p>There is no need to store the return value of <code>specialCharactersExists(url)</code> to a variable. It only adds an unnecessary large if-statement. Instead, check the value and exit early. Also, the characters you check are not special, they're "illegal" or "invalid" in your implementation so change name to reflect that:</p>

<pre><code>    if (illegalCharactersExist(url)) {
        return false;
    }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Missing final</strong></p>

<p>Variables that are not supposed to change should be marked as <code>final</code>. If you decide to keep the containsSpecialCharacters variable, it should be marked as final (and named as decribed above).</p>

<pre><code>final boolean containsIllegalCharacters = illegalCharactersExist(url);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Reuse Pattern</strong></p>

<p>The Pattern class is <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">thread safe</a>. You should compile the pattern once into a static variable and reuse it in the matcher. Also, regex is not a good name. It tells what the variable is, not what it's purpose is. Naming should always reflect purpose.</p>

<pre><code>    private static final Pattern ILLEGAL_CHAR_PATTERN = Pattern.compile("[^A-Za-z0-9.-]");
</code></pre>

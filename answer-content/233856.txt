<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>I would advise against the use of <code>GroupBy</code> in this case. It seems dangerous to do so and is very hard to understand. I would recommend something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public static bool WasSendShortlyAfter(this ArticleEmail email, ArticleEmail start)
{
    var maxMailingTime = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30);
    var diff = email.DateCreate - start.DateCreate;

    return diff &gt;= TimeSpan.Zero &amp;&amp; diff &lt;= maxMailingTime;
}
</code></pre>

<p>and then you can do this:</p>

<pre><code>var groupStarters = emails
    .Where(potentialStart =&gt; !emails
        .Any(email =&gt; potentialStart.WasSendShortlyAfter(email)));
var groups = groupStarters
    .Select(start =&gt; emails.Where(email =&gt; email.WasSendShortlyAfter(start));
</code></pre>

<p>Remarks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Alternatively <code>WasSendShortlyAfter</code> could be a member method of <code>ArticleEmail</code>.</li>
<li>It would be nice if <code>maxMailingTime</code> would be configurable in some way.</li>
<li>Not sure how performant my solution is. If the operation is performance critical there might be better options.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nice approach and implementation. I like how you broke down the solution into simpler methods. Few suggestions:</p>
<h2>Naming</h2>
<p>The name of the method <code>depthFirstSearch</code> is not the best. From a method with such name I would expect it to search something, return a result and most importantly don't change the input. Instead, it sets to null all similar strings and returns nothing. So a better name might be <code>sinkSimilarStrings</code> or <code>sinkGroupOfSimilarStrings</code>.</p>
<h2>Behavior mismatch and reusability</h2>
<p>From the problem description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two strings X and Y are similar if we can swap two letters (in different positions) of X, so that it equals Y. Also two strings X and Y are similar if they are equal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However the method <code>areSimilar</code> doesn't check:</p>
<ul>
<li>if the different letters are the same</li>
</ul>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>areSimilar("cars","rats"); // returns true
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>if the strings have same length</li>
</ul>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>areSimilar("cars","carssssss"); // returns true
</code></pre>
<p>In the context of this problem the method works because the input strings are anagrams, but it's a bit confusing and the assumption that the input strings must be anagrams makes this method hard to reuse.</p>
<h2>Missing description of the solution</h2>
<p>Would be better to add a couple of lines to describe your approach. Next time you can add it to your question or as comments in the code. Even if the names of the variables and methods are self-descriptive is not straightforward to understand your approach from the code (at least for me). It will also higher the chance to get more reviews.</p>

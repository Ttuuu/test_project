<p>is wrong. For example, every <code>int</code> in the range 65537 to 80264 inclusive overflows to a value which is greater than itself.</p>

<p>The easy fix is to add an overflow check. That would also fix the memory problem, because <code>sieve</code> would have no more entries than there are primes below 65536.</p>

  <p>Is this as extendable as I think it is?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does it work for multi-bit flags? For instance</p>

<pre><code>[Flags]
enum Modifiers : uint {
    None = 0,
    Private = 1,
    Protected = 2,
    Public = 4,
    NonPublic = Private | Protected,  // &lt;- multi-bit
    All = ~None
}
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are there any APIs missing that I didn't think of or would be
  convinient?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.specialized.bitvector32?view=netframework-4.8" rel="noreferrer">BitVector32</a> has support for bit flags, sections, masks. Perhaps this serves your purpose better, since it is dynamic and flexible. There are no design time constraints like in an enum.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What do you think about the automatic Flag maintenance and options
  creation?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's cool, but I would have a look at existing API's how to augment it for masks and multi-bit flags.</p>

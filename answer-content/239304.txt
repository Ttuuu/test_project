<p>Yes, your approach is correct.</p>

<p>However, you parallelize various queries, which probably go to a remote backing database. As you told us nothing about the runtime of these queries, the nature of the database, the complexity of the underlying statements, I can only ask you to <strong><em>measure</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Parallelism induces overhead - in the runtime AND in program complexity. Check, whether it is worth it, and where your bottlenecks lie.</p>

<p>In my experience from enterprise applications, real big data transfers are normally not made better by parallelism, as the bottleneck is often the network between application server and database.</p>

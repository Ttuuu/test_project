<p>It seems unclear what responsibilities the Cell class is supposed to have. You obtain a Cell from the Board and then query the cell for information about whether it is flipped or not but to flip a cell or get the surrounding cells you have to make a request to Board.</p>

<p>To me it would make sense that the operations that are done on a Cell would be done through the Cell in question. The cell would provide information about whether it is flipped or not. Whether it has been flagged or not. It's status after flipping (empty, number of surrounding mines, bomb).</p>

<p>The board would provide information about the state of the game and access to cells.</p>

<p>Even though the model is internal to your CLI/Swing UI, you should still maintain separation of concerns. Access to object's fields should be done through accessor methods, not directly, and the fields should be private. Once you start modifying object's internal state from other objects you introduce yourself to a food fight in an Italian restaurant. That spaghetti gets really messy.</p>

<p>Your description says that you want to check whether the <code>searchTimestamp</code> is less than 10 minutes old. Your code does something different, though.</p>

<p>Your code checks whether there's less than 10 minutes between the times (the difference is &lt;= 10 minutes .... If the searchTimestamp is 2 minutes in the future, it will pass the test, if it is 9 minutes in the future, it will pass the test, and if it is 11 minutes in the future, it will <strong><em>fail</em></strong> the test.</p>

<p>Of interest, the math you use does a 10 minute check, but the message says <em>"greater than 5 minutes old."</em></p>

<p>Your message should say: <em>"timestamp is older than 10 minutes, or more than 10 minutes in the future"</em></p>

<p>So, changing your code to be what I think it should be, is a lot simpler than you would think.</p>

<p>What you want is for the <code>searchTimestamp</code> to have happened sometime after 10 minutes ago.... this is the way to do it:</p>

<pre><code>private static final int TEN_MINUTES = 10 * 60 * 1000;
</code></pre>

<p>then, in your method:</p>

<pre><code>long tenAgo = System.currentTimeMillis() - TEN_MINUTES;
if (searchTimestamp &lt; tenAgo) {
    System.out.println("searchTimestamp is older than 10 minutes");
}
</code></pre>

<p>of course.</p>

<p><a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/104445/10221">Here is a code review answer</a> that shows how one could sort on multiple criteria. I think it will be useful to read the entire thread.</p>

  <p>but I don't know how to group while comparing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I suspect explicit grouping is not necessary at all. Grouping is a natural consequence of sorting. This is because while 2 things are equal for a given criterion the sort continues down the criteria chain until a non-equal comparison is made or the last criterion is done.</p>

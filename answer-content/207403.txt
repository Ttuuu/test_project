<p>I agree with Roman's answer in that the code is already compact. In it's current configuration though, it is not very scalable. There is a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplicate_code" rel="nofollow noreferrer">duplicate code</a> in <code>__main__</code>, and you could replace the <code>Account</code> creation statements with a dictionary of tuples and a for-loop. Then you could store the <code>Account</code> instances back into a dictionary. Using a dictionary would allow you to reference the accounts by the name of the holder rather than by free-standing variables, which seems semantically cleaner.</p>

<p>Additionally, the <code>print</code> statements could be replaced with a for-loop as well.</p>

<p>These modifications may not reduce the number of lines in the code as is, but if you consider a case where you wanted to make 100 <code>Account</code>s and print information about them, then the approach above may be better.</p>

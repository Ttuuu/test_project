<p>If you want to calculate the farthest point you don't need to use the square root for 'real' distance calculation. Since you only need the distance for comparison and not the actual distance it is totally sufficient to compare by <code>x*x + y*y</code> instead of <code>sqrt(x*x + y*y)</code></p>

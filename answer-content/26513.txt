<p>First of all I'd suggest to remove <em>expired</em> business-logic from UI <code>event handler</code> (looks like <code>CheckExpiredItems</code> method belongs to some UI class). </p>

<p>If you are focusing on some concurrent logic you can create your own collection class, having inner member of  <code>ConcurrentDictionary</code> type. Then you can explicitly implement <code>RemoveExpiredItems</code> method and create <strong>unit-tests</strong> or even <strong>integration</strong> tests, covering the desired functionality (for example you can emulate mult-threaded environment and check if your collection removes only expired items and correctly restores unexpired ones).</p>

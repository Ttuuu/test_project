<p>If you want people to use your library, then you want to think about how to make it easy for others to adopt it.</p>

<p>I would consider revamping the implementation into a <a href="https://github.com/nothings/single_file_libs" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Single-file library</a>. Simply put, the more files, the more tedious it becomes to add someone else's code to your project. Which is why, single-file libraries are popular in the C/C++ world because they are easy to manage (package management facilities are lacking in these languages). Personally, I've used hashmaps, bignum libraries, red-black trees etc, all delivered as single-file C libraries. But if I have to add more than one (or two) files to use someone else's code, likely I won't bother.</p>

<p>For me, the other dealbreaker would be Windows compatiblity. Windows compatiblity is very important for me and I can see that you are using several features not available on MSVC.</p>

<p>This code is slow because:</p>

<ol>
<li>It builds a new keyword tree for each test case. Just build it once, using all the genes.</li>
<li>It builds a list of all the matching keywords. <code>KeywordTree.search_all()</code> is a generator, just loop over it directly. And,</li>
<li>It loops over the list of genes to find the gene index, so that it can find the health.<br>
Instead, build a dict with the genes as keys and an (index, health) tuple for the value. </li>
</ol>

<p>Something like this (untested):</p>

<pre><code>import math
from collections import defaultdict
from ahocorapy.keywordtree import KeywordTree


def geneshealth(genes, health, testcases):

    # build the kwtree using all the genes

        kwtree.add(gene)
    kwtree.finalize()

    # build a dict that maps a gene to a list of (index, health) tuples
    index_and_health = defaultdict(list)
    for gene, data in zip(genes, enumerate(health)):

    for case in testcases:
        start, end, dna = case.split()
        start = int(start)
        end = int(end)

        dna_health = 0

<ul>
<li><p>An <code>M</code> field is never pushed. It may only happen as a result of an unfortunate click. Testing for <code>board[r][c] == 'M'</code> in the loop is a waste of time. Test it once, <code>if board[click[0]][click[1]] == 'M'</code>, before the loop.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, you should not bother with neighbors if the field is not blank. A test for <code>board[r][c] == 'B'</code> happens too late. As implemented, for other fields code still compute neighbors - and does nothing with them.</p></li>
<li><p>The tests for <code>0 &lt;= dr &lt; m and 0 &lt;= dc &lt; n</code> <em>may</em> also cause performance issues, and do not look Pythonic. Ask forgiveness not permission, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>    try:
        if board[dr][dc] == 'M':
            mines += 1
    except IndexError:
        pass
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Quite a few fields are pushed and inspected multiple times. I am not sure wether it is a bottleneck; however the right-hand and scanline methods of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill" rel="nofollow noreferrer">flood fill algorithm</a> do worth investigation.</p></li>

<p>Previous commenters have alluded to the fact that the rand() function provided by programming language libraries is at best pseudorandom and incapable of providing secure passwords. It would be reasonable to use the /dev/random device (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//dev/random" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//dev/random</a>) on unix-like systems, or the Microsoft library CryptGenRandom on Windows systems (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CryptGenRandom" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CryptGenRandom</a> -- lighter-weight alternative here: <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/michael_howard/2005/01/14/cryptographically-secure-random-number-on-windows-without-using-cryptoapi/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/michael_howard/2005/01/14/cryptographically-secure-random-number-on-windows-without-using-cryptoapi/</a>) as sources of randomness, as these use observed external events (e.g., from device drivers) to generate a random number pool rather than using a pseudorandom generator whose outputs can be predicted.  </p>

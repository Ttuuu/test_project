<p>Welcome to Code Review!</p>
<p>I'm not too familiar with Unity, so I can't really comment or offer advice on Unity-specific things.</p>
<p>There are still a few places where I feel like your code could be improved however.</p>
<h1>Whitespace</h1>
<p>While I generally prefer to keep my code not too dense, I recommend never having more than one blank line in a row (except <em>maybe</em> if you want to separate a block of imports or <code>using</code>s from the rest of the code); some editors will even automatically remove any consecutive blank lines when you format your document.</p>
<p>Similarly, that blank line at the end of your <code>Distance()</code> method doesn't serve any purpose, so I would just remove it, or maybe move it right below your <code>aPos</code> and <code>bPos</code> declarations.</p>
<h1><code>AreClose()</code> method</h1>
<p>Your <code>AreClose()</code> method could be rewritten in a much shorter and cleaner way, like so :</p>
<pre><code>private static bool AreClose(GameObject a, GameObject b)
{
    double result = Distance(a, b);
    return (result &lt; 2.5); // random magic number for now
}
</code></pre>
<p>That's because the expression <code>result &lt; 2.5</code> itself evaluates to a boolean, so there's no need to check whether its value true or false, you can simply return it.</p>
<p>You could further shorten it to...</p>
<pre><code>private static bool AreClose(GameObject a, GameObject b)
{
    return Distance(a, b) &lt; 2.5; // random magic number for now
}
</code></pre>
<p>...since, in my opinion, the variable <code>result</code> doesn't add anything to the readability or the clarity of the code. Seeing <code>Distance(a, b) &lt; someMagicNumber</code> is clear enough on its own.</p>
<p>You could go even further and take advantage of C#'s expression body definitions, like so</p>
<pre><code>private static bool AreClose(GameObject a, GameObject b) =&gt; Distance(a, b) &lt; 2.5; // random magic number for now
</code></pre>
<p>...which doesn't look too great here because of that comment. I would recommend you put that magic number into a <code>const</code> variable, either declared inside <code>AreClose()</code> or as a class variable. This will make your code easier to modify in the future, and also allows you to give it a meaningful name like <code>MIN_DISTANCE</code>.</p>
<pre><code>private static bool AreClose(GameObject a, GameObject b) =&gt; Distance(a, b) &lt; MIN_DISTANCE;
</code></pre>
<h1><code>Distance()</code> method</h1>
<p>Like I said earlier, I'm not too familiar with Unity, but I'm pretty sure it has a built-in method for computing the distance between two vectors, like so <code>Vector3.Distance(aPos, bPos)</code>.</p>
<p>There's nothing inherently wrong with doing it yourself if you're just trying to learn and get familiar with a new language or concept, but if you're looking for optimal performance or accuracy, I would recommend making sure there isn't already a function that does what you need before trying to reinvent the wheel -although in this specific case it's probably not too important.</p>
<p>Additionally, I would avoid using <code>Math.Pow()</code> when you only want to square a number, as it's quite an expensive operation compared to simply doing <code>(aPos.x - bPos.x) * (aPos.x - bPos.x)</code>. This is because <code>Math.Pow()</code> needs to be able to handle non-integer exponents and (probably) uses Taylor series (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series</a>) to compute powers for arbitrary exponents, even if your exponent happens to be <code>2</code>. So you can just compute the square yourself, which should significantly improve performance.</p>
<p>You could also create a <code>DistanceSquared()</code> method, and compare it with <code>MIN_DISTANCE * MIN_DISTANCE</code>, which is equivalent to comparing <code>Distance()</code> and <code>MIN_DISTANCE</code>. This allows you to avoid using <code>Math.Sqrt()</code>, which is, again, a rather slow operation. Then you can rewrite <code>Distance()</code> like this, if you still want it :</p>
<pre><code>public static double Distance(GameObject a, GameObject b) =&gt; Math.Sqrt(DistanceSquared(a, b));
</code></pre>

<p>Looks good to me on a cursory glance. It's pretty much the exact same code as in <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/Condition.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition</a> JavaDoc.</p>

<p>The only definitive problem I see is the catching and logging of <code>InterruptedException</code>. The code acts towards the caller as if the operation succeeded while nothing was done.</p>

<p>Not providing a way to set the maximum wait time will be a limitation in a library intended for generic use.</p>

<p>Stylistically, <code>private int max</code> should be final to emphasize that it must not be changed after initialization (as changing it when threads are waiting would cause serious problems).</p>

<p>Another thing, which may be a matter of taste, is the <code>stack.size() == max</code> comparison. I always like to use <code>&gt;=</code> where a size is compared to a maximum limit (with a comment, of course). This gives an extra safeguard against infinite loops in the case where a programming error causes the collection to exceed maximum size.</p>

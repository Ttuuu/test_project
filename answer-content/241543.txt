<p>Your algorithm only works for values which are zero or positive.  Java's "int" type is signed, so you need to consider negative numbers too.  Your algorithm will fail hard on this, not least because taking a log of a negative number returns NaN, which results in zero when you cast it to int.</p>

<p>Your first step in the algorithm should be to handle the sign of the number.  After that you can sort out how to process an unsigned value.</p>

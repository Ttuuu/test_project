<p>Some notes which was not mentioned earlier:</p>

<ol>
<li>

<pre><code>Machine machine1 = new Machine();
</code></pre>

<p>The variable name could be simply <code>machine</code>. I don't see any reason for the <code>1</code> postfix.</p></li>
<li><p>I think the usual style for a for loop is the following and the most developer is more familiar with it than a countdown loop:</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>Using a well-known pattern makes maintenance easier.</p></li>
<li><p>I've found good practice to have a separate class for the <code>main</code> method as you did.</p></li>
<li><p>I'd put the variable declarations to separate lines. From Code Complete, 2nd Edition, p759:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With statements on their own lines, the code reads from top to bottom, instead
  of top to bottom and left to right. When you’re looking for a specific line of code,
  your eye should be able to follow the left margin of the code. It shouldn’t have to
  dip into each and every line just because a single line might contain two statements.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Having one <code>Random</code> instance and using it multiple times is good. (Initializing it every time could be slow and unnecessary.)</p></li>
<li><p>Using <code>System.out.format</code> instead of <code>System.out.println</code> with long string concatenations is easier to read:</p>

<pre><code>System.out.format("%d + %d\n", num1, num2);
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>I guess using ++ and -- is a little bit easier to read than</p>

<pre><code>score = score + 1;
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>I agree with <em>@Uri Agassi</em>, you should separate the responsibilities. Aside from that you could move the last <code>System.out</code> after the if-else condition:</p>

<pre><code>if (att == ans) {
    score = score + 1;
    System.out.println("Correct");
    System.out.println("Score is currently: " + score + "/5");
} else {
    score = score - 1;
    System.out.println("Incorrect");
    System.out.println("Score is currently: " + score + "/5");
}
</code></pre>

<p>It would remove some duplication:</p>

<pre><code>if (att == ans) {
    score++;
    System.out.println("Correct");
} else {
    score--;
    System.out.println("Incorrect");
}
System.out.println("Score is currently: " + score + "/5");
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

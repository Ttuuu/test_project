<p>A few notes:</p>

<p>Firstly, I would add some <em>docstrings</em> to each function to document what the expected behaviour is.</p>

<p>In <code>select</code> when you're not doing any mutations (i.e. under the * case), it seems you could just return <code>self</code>. Is there any reason to make a new copy?</p>

<p>In <code>select</code>, <code>where</code>, <code>astype</code> instead of creating a temporary dict, you could use a dict comprehension instead, example:</p>

<pre><code>def where(self, cond):
    return type(self)({key: value for key, value in self.json.items() if cond(key, value)})
</code></pre>

<p>In <code>astype</code> you're using <code>JSONSelector</code>, however everywhere else you're using <code>type(self)</code> this should be consistent whichever one you go for.</p>

<p><code>print</code> seems like an unnecessary function, but if you keep it the <code>return</code> lines have no effect.</p>

<p>Hope that's helpful.</p>

<p>In programming, there are only three useful numbers, 0, 1, and many.</p>

<p>If you write an if-condition that repeats all the tests already done, you're doing something wrong.</p>

<p>If you write similar ad hoc code for three special cases, you're doing something wrong.</p>

<p>E.g. adding "11 Plung" will require two more lines for the special case and the "no match" case will have to be made even longer and uglier.</p>

<p>Write simple code for a general case, and then supply specific data as needed:</p>

<pre><code>def convert(number):
    names = [ [3, "Pling"], [5, "Plang"], [7, "Plong"] ]
    result = ""
    for value,message in names:
        if not number % value: result += message
    if message == "": message = f"{number}"
    return result

for index in range(1,25): print(index, convert(index))
</code></pre>

<p>That way, if you later need to add the "11" case, it's a simple change, and more importantly it happens in only one place.</p>

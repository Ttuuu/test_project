<p>Some important remarks regarding performance:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Calling <code>strcmp</code> repeatedly on the same data in some <code>if - else if</code> listing is naive and very inefficient. This will kill significant amounts of execution time, particularly on low-end microcontrollers.</p>
<p>Instead you should have all valid strings stored in a sorted look-up table. Then use binary search on that table instead. You can use standard C <code>bsearch</code> or implement it yourself - it's not hard to do.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You probably don't want to use <code>strtok</code> since it destroys the data passed, which in turn means that you'll have to make additional hard copies of it in advance, which is inefficient. A simple <code>while(*ptr == ' ' &amp;&amp; *ptr != '\0') {}</code> could be used instead.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In general, you shouldn't need to make any calls to <code>strcpy</code> once you have copied the data from the I2C hardware buffers into RAM variables. Instead of shovelling whole data strings around, copy pointers if needed. Similarly, there should be no need to <code>memset</code> anything to zero.</p>
</li>
</ul>

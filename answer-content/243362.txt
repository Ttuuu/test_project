<p>Welcome to Stack Overflow! Based on your code and what your were trying to do (and  one suggestion from Ludisposed) here's a attempt where you only scan once the directory where your files are situated:</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>import re
import pathlib
import os
import collections

directory_of_source_file = pathlib.Path("Input files")
file_set_from_input = 'California1998'

state_name_matcher = re.compile(r'([a-z]+)(\d{4,5})?', re.IGNORECASE)
if state_name_found := state_name_matcher.match(file_set_from_input):
    state_wanted = state_name_found[1]
    set_number = state_name_found[2]
    set_number = '' if set_number is None else set_number

    files_found = directory_of_source_file.glob(f"{state_wanted}{set_number}*")
    files_found_strings = list(map(str, files_found))
    if set_number:
        files_found_formatted = [files_found_strings, ]
    else:
        strict_state_name_matcher = re.compile(rf'{os.sep}{state_wanted}(\d{{4,5}})', re.IGNORECASE)
        documents_collector = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for current_file in files_found_strings:
            if matching_document_found := strict_state_name_matcher.search(current_file):
                current_set_number = matching_document_found[1]
                documents_collector[current_set_number].append(current_file)
        files_found_formatted = list(documents_collector.values())
    for current_file_set in files_found_formatted:
        current_file_set.sort()
    print(files_found_formatted)
else:
    print('Put some error message here')
</code></pre>

<p>I hope I understood correctly what you were trying to do</p>

<p>These interfaces are meant to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ftx85f8x.aspx" rel="nofollow">work with the userâ€™s identity information</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.principal.iidentity.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>IIdentity</code></a>: An identity object represents the user on whose behalf the code is running.</li>
<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.principal.iprincipal.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>IPrincipal</code></a>: A principal object represents the security context of the user on whose behalf the code is running, including that user's identity (<code>IIdentity</code>) and any roles to which they belong.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just from looking at the documentation, your implementation looks weird. You are permanently linking the identity of a user to a fixed role. As far as I understand it, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dc8ztsad.aspx" rel="nofollow">a user might operate on different roles at different times</a>. This provides for better encapsulation. The main 'design' problem I see is your identity now contains an identity, which contains an identity, with inside, ... an identity, and there ... you get the point.</p>

<p>Futhermore, perhaps the default implementations of <code>IIdentity</code> and <code>IPrincipal</code> can already help you? Take a look at the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.principal.aspx" rel="nofollow">generic implementations</a>.</p>

<p>I suspect the try-except in the loops are the main cause of the slowness. It's not clear at which point you get <code>ValueError</code> due to "funky" data. It would be good to clean that up, get rid of the try-catch, and I think your solution will get noticeably faster.</p>

<p>Another small thing, that might not make a noticeable difference at all, you have some repeated lookups, like in this snippet:</p>

<pre><code>if g.get('weather'):
    for name in weather_list:
        if g.get('weather').get(name):
</code></pre>

<p>Here, the <code>g.get('weather')</code> bit is executed twice. It would be better to save the result of the first call, and then reuse that. Apply this logic to other similar places. Although it might not make a practical difference, avoiding duplicated logic is a good practice.</p>

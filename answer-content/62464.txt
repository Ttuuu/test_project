<p>Here's a crazy idea. What if you code eliminated most of these comments and instead became self-documenting?  </p>

<p>Is this dark magic, plain nonsense or actually viable for production code?  Let's take a stab at it.</p>

<p>Let's simply change your function names and parameters and see if it makes a difference.</p>

<p>(<strong>UPDATED</strong> first function name due to error pointed out in comments.)</p>

<pre><code> void printSumOfThreeNumbers(int first, int second, int third);
 double divideFirstNumberBySecondAndThenThird(float first, float second, float third);
 void divideFirstNumberBySecondAndThenThirdAndPrintResult(float first, float second, float third);
</code></pre>

<p>Now I'm willing to bet you can delete EVERY COMMENT in your original code snippet and most sensible people will not whine about an apparent lack of comments; your code's intention is expressed rather well in the names alone.</p>

<p>A lot of people reading code would prefer the above instead of some fluffy flavor text that will very soon <strong>rot</strong>; meaning that the next guy who comes along may change your (private) functions, add/subtract parameters and <em>not even bother</em> to change your elaborate comments rendering them ineffective at best and inaccurate/misleading at worst.</p>

<p>By letting your code read better with <strong>meaningful</strong> function and variable names, you are doing your readers a favor.</p>

<p>Software is often a write-once, read-many-times activity. </p>

  <p>using lambdas might be expensive</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why do you think that?</p>

<p>Lambdas are simply syntactic hand waving for class functors (that have been around for over 3 decades). Functors are considered (in general) to be much more efficient than standard functions (especially when used by templates) as the compiler can do a lot of optimizations on them.</p>

<pre><code>auto x = [&amp;capture](X const&amp; parm){ /* BODY */ }
</code></pre>

<p>You can consider as syntactic sugar for:</p>

<pre><code>class CompilerNamedType
{
    TypeOfCapure&amp;     capture;
    public:
        CompilerNamedType(TypeOfCapure&amp; capture)
            : capture(capture)
        {}

        CompilerCalculatedReturnType operator()(X const&amp; param) const
        {
            /* BODY */
        }
};

CompilerNamedType  x(capture);
</code></pre>

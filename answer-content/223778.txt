<p>IntelliJ reports:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>. . . While occasionally intended, this construction is confusing, and often the result of a typo.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree with the first part, but it's letting you know about this mainly for the second part. It's pretty common on Stack Overflow to see problems arise from people putting a semicolon in weird places and having odd behavior as a result:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why does this code only print once?</p>

<pre><code>for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++); {
      System.out.println("Text");
}
</code></pre>

<p>An IDE warning would have given hints as to what the problem was.</p>

<p>Like I said though, I agree with it pointing this out for reasons other than a typo too. I personally find it to read less explicitly. To me, the body represents what the purpose/action of the loop is, and the parenthesized part before the body states the bounds of the problem being dealt with by the loop.</p>

<p>I find your preferred way to be forcing too much onto one line, and I generally find it less clear. The full version is quite explicit (I added braces to avoid a whole other set of problems that IntelliJ likely warned you about):</p>

<pre><code>// Standard index bounds. Nothing to think about
for(i = 0; i &lt; stArray.length; i++) {
    if (stArray[i] == "bozo") {
        break; // Break when i points to "bozo". Easy
    }
}

// Loop while i is in bounds... and i doesn't point to "bozo"
// Oh, break when it points to "bozo"
for(i = 0; i &lt; stArray.length &amp;&amp; stArray[i] != "bozo"; i++);
</code></pre>

<p>It honestly took me longer to mentally verify the correctness of your shorter version.</p>

<p>Also, what if you wanted to add debugging prints or something else to the loop? You'd need to add a body in that case anyway. And are you going to keep the <code>&amp;&amp; stArray[i] != "bozo"</code> part once you have a body?</p>

<p>I'd also take your benchmarking with a grain of salt. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/504103/how-do-i-write-a-correct-micro-benchmark-in-java">Java is not a simple language to do micro-benchmarking on</a>, and it's more likely that your measured speedup is a result of a fluke, or from the first loop having warmed up the JVM first.</p>

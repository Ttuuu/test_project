<p>As suggested by @RobH himself, I've turned my comment into an additionnal answer:</p>

<ul>
<li>As this is "The Angular Way", I would encapsulate the State/Timer functionality in a Service </li>
<li>I would have the <code>incrementTimer()</code> function calculate the number of seconds elapsed since last switching to <code>"Running"</code></li>
<li>Finally, the <code>$scope.status</code> and <code>$scope.timer</code> properties should be made into functions that point to this Service and let the <code>$digest()</code> loop do its thing</li>
</ul>
    </div>

<p>I noticed that you have a ton of comments in your code. Now don't get me wrong, comments are great, but there is such a thing as too many. Good code will be self-documenting, which means that you should be able to understand it well even without comments. Some of these comments are extremely unnecessary such as</p>

<pre><code> if change &lt;= 9:                     #checks if the amount is lower or equal to 9
</code></pre>

<p>Any programmer can tell what this is doing without the comment. You don't need it.</p>

<p>Other than that I'd recommend more modularity. As others have pointed out there's a lot of repetition in your code. You can fix this by using functions.</p>

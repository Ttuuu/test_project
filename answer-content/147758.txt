<p>The only thing I can think of is rather minor, but it might help a little bit: consider making a short method that calls <code>System.out.println()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>void print(String string) { System.out.println(string); }
</code></pre>

<p>Also helpful, you can use "\n" for a new line. Thus:</p>

<pre><code>    print("You didn't take the job so you gained or lost nothing."
        + "\nYou now have " + money + " pound left"
        + "\nYou now have " + damage + " damage"
        + "\nYou now have " + health + " health");
</code></pre>

<p>I'm wondering if you can come up with a basic way to make the story segments into a class structure. </p>

<p>As long as the story is short, it doesn't matter a whole lot. I'm not into making objects just for the sake of making objects because the language is OO. There should be some clear purpose being served for going to the trouble. </p>

<p>I haven't programmed a word-adventure game before, so I don't know the common structures used. But as you go on, if you find yourself repeating anything, there is most likely a way to code it so that you can avoid the repetition.</p>

<p>For example, maybe set up a method or class that prints the status information.</p>

<pre><code>printPlayerStatus()
{
     print( "You now have " + money + " pound left"
        + "\nYou now have " + damage + " damage"
        + "\nYou now have " + health + " health");
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can call this periodically instead of writing all three lines repeatedly. That sort of thing.</p>

<p>The folks at Java-gaming.org may have some advice on how to structure a text-adventure game. There is a lot of game-making expertise there.</p>

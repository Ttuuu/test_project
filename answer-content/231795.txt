<p>Although you think that the second one is closer to your desired syntax, it is actually somewhat confusing. If <code>LetSet</code> was a function with only one parameter, this would cause a Let coercion on the RHS, if an object is supplied. E.g. if the RHS is a range, the usual behaviour of a Let assignment is that the values in the range are assigned instead of the object. Only because <code>LetSet</code> is parameterized, the object itself is assigned.</p>

<p>So, following the principle of least surprise, I would suggest to use the first version.</p>

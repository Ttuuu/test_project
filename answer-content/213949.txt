<p>Why is <code>Block</code> a class?  It seems to have a single - effectively public - member, (which you described as <code>weight</code> but then gave the much less meaningful name of <code>m_value</code>), so it could simply be replaced by a plain <code>int</code>.</p>

<p>To use <code>printf()</code>, we need to include <code>&lt;cstdio&gt;</code> (and name it properly: <code>std::printf()</code>).  Prefer C++ headers to C headers (<code>&lt;cstdint&gt;</code> rather than <code>&lt;stdint.h&gt;</code> - or just remove that include, since it's never used).</p>

<p>Prefer to use smart pointers and containers to manage ownership and simplify your memory management.  When <code>new</code> and/or <code>new[]</code> are unavoidable, then make sure you exercise your tests under a memory checker such as Valgrind.</p>

<p>Prefer initialisers to assignment (compiler warnings should help you avoid uninitialized members):</p>

<pre><code>    Block(int value)
      : m_value{value}
    {
    }
</code></pre>

<p>And everything that other reviewers have mentioned.</p>

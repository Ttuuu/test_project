<p>Do not instantiate a new String. There's no point as you set the value again on the next line anyway.</p>

<pre><code>String str = String.valueOf(cont); 
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of going from 1 -&gt; X and getting the last value, you could go from X -&gt; 1 and get the first value found.</p>

<p>I strongly suggest renaming your variables to be more descriptive (English). It'll make it easier to understand what your code is accomplishing.</p>

<p>Instead of using <code>indexOf()</code> you could use <code>contains()</code>, although you'll have to do some testing to see if it the performance is better.</p>

<p>There's no need to use <code>synchronize</code> for readers, as you are acquiring the lock for <code>readCount++</code> and <code>readCount--</code>.</p>

<p>One drawback in your code is the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation_(computer_science)" rel="nofollow noreferrer">starvation</a></strong> for writers. The first reader has acquired <code>writeLock</code>, and so subsequent readers will keep on coming and will not let <code>readCount</code> become 0. So any waiting writers will always wait for <code>writeLock</code> to be released and will eventually starve.</p>

<p>You can have a separate project for your Dockfile and let gitlab keep the image in a <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/docker/using_docker_build.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">container repository</a>. That way you will not need to rebuild the image every build and you can reuse the container in other project without rebuilding it. </p>

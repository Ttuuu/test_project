<p>I’m not a C# guy, but I <strong>can</strong> suggest that an error message should say something <strong>about</strong> the error.  “Error” says as much as “an error occurred.”  Since you tried to read an integer, perhaps “Integer only, please.”</p>

<p>Speaking of which, since you are only accepting integers, perhaps the prompt should say “integer” instead of “number.”</p>

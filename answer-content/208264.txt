<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>your code looks <strong>very good</strong>, there are only <strong>minor issues</strong>:</p>

<h1>1) naming</h1>

<p>since you don't create any instances of <code>FragmentsManager</code> you should consider to rename it to <code>FragmentsUtility</code>. An Utility class provides <strong>methods</strong> to help you with your code while a Manager is an <strong>instance</strong> that does the work for you.</p>

<p>boolean should beginn with prefix <em>is</em> (or rarely as an alternative <em>has/can/should</em>) (in Java it's convention to use camelCase)
so rename your <code>boolean add_to_backstack</code> into <code>boolean isAddedToBackstack</code> rather (btw. in java it's convention to use camelCase)</p>

<h1>2) comments</h1>

<p>remove commented code!</p>

<h1>3) javadoc</h1>

<p>you provide some javadoc on the <code>addFragment</code> methode which is very crude - get things done and finish it!</p>

<p>the same applies to <code>replaceFragment</code>.</p>

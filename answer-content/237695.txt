<p>All in all your code looks quite good, it even has documentation! It's interesting to see assignment expressions in actual use, though I have yet to decide if I'm a fan of them. But of course Code Review would not be Code Review if there was nothing to nitpick about ;-)</p>

<p>As per <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="noreferrer">PEP 8</a>, </p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>isbn13(isbn, writer = ImageWriter())
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>should be</p>

<pre><code>isbn13(isbn, writer=ImageWriter())
</code></pre>

<p>whereas</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>code = create_code_png(isbn:=row[0],title:=remove_forbidden(row[1]))
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>should be </p>

<pre><code>code = create_code_png(isbn:=row[0], title:=remove_forbidden(row[1]))
</code></pre>

<p>We have a <a href="https://codereview.meta.stackexchange.com/a/5252/92478">little list here on Code Review Meta</a> where you'll find a few tools that can help you to enforce a consistent style, even in larger projects.</p>

<p>Apart from that, you could use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.maketrans" rel="noreferrer"><code>str.maketrans/str.translate</code></a> in <code>remove_forbidden</code>:</p>

<pre><code># somewhere earlier
FORBIDDEN_SYMBOLS = str.maketrans({letter: "" for letter in ":;&lt;&gt;\"\\/?*|."})

def remove_forbidden(string_in):
     """Removes characters forbidden from windows file names from a string"""
     return string_in.translate(FORBIDDEN_SYMBOLS)
</code></pre>

<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>this_is_asuperfancyfilename
</code></pre>

<p>By keeping <code>FORBIDDEN_SYMBOLS</code> somewhere outside the function, e.g. as a script level constant, this will be a little bit faster than your original implementation.</p>

<p>If you want to include even more shiny Python features in addition to assignment expressions, maybe also have a look at <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/" rel="noreferrer">f-strings</a> (3.6+) and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html" rel="noreferrer">type annotations</a> (3.5+).</p>

<p>I also would not use <code>os.chdir</code> but instead build a full path using either <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>os.path.join</code></a> (the old way) or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html" rel="noreferrer">the Pathlib module</a> (the new way).</p>

<p>This code involves sorting an array of \$N\$ elements, so it has \$O(N * log N)\$ time complexity. To achieve \$O(N)\$ time complexity, you need to avoid sorting input data. Instead, you can create an array of \$N\$ bools to check that each number from \$1\$ to \$N\$ is present in the input array.</p>

<p>Welcome to Code Review.
I'm new to this site too so I hope that this is what you are looking for.</p>

<p>Looking at the API call it seems that <code>GetDataPage</code> does more than one action:</p>

<ul>
<li>validates the inputs used to form the URL </li>
<li>forms the URL</li>
<li>create a HttpWebRequest instance</li>
<li>makes the call</li>
<li>formats the response</li>
</ul>

<p>I would suggest refactoring <code>GetDataPage</code> into 5 smaller methods to make it more self-documenting.</p>

<p>In terms of calling the API there does not seem to be any handling for cases other than the happy path, eg,</p>

<ul>
<li>if the server is down</li>
<li>if the server hangs, ie, you make the request and get no response back. In this case I suspect your code will hang as the call to the API is not async</li>
<li>if the server returns a response other than the expected one (I guess a 200)</li>
</ul>

<p>Adding code to address these would make your code more robust. If there is one suggestion over all the others it would be to make the HTTP request async so that the application is not blocked while awaiting the response.</p>

<p>I notice that there is no exception handling but I am assuming that this is a prototype.</p>

<p>I hope that helps.</p>

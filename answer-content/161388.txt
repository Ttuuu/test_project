<p>So according to your helpful answers and a little surfing on the web I found out that I need a <strong><em>pseudo random generator</em></strong>, which is a kind of RNG that does not generate repetitive numbers.</p>

<p>The other point is that I should have a different <strong>seed</strong> for each and every thread, so in the code I've passed the thread ID to the random generator function and used the <strong><em>rand_r()</em></strong> with different seeds.</p>

<p>here is the complete and no error code if you want to check it out:

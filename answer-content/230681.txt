<p>I would make the function slightly more generic. After all, you do calculate <em>all</em> distances anyway. I don't think list length becomes a storage space issue here, so why not return a list sorted by distance to the player?</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>from typing import Tuple, List

def distance(character: Tuple[int, int], enemy: Tuple[int, int]) -&gt; int:
    return math.sqrt((character[0] - enemy[0]) ** 2 + (character[1] - enemy[1]) ** 2)
</code></pre>

<p>No reason to use math.pow when we have a perfectly valid <code>**</code> operator. Some would also prefer to use it to get the root, but I don't really like that with regards to readability.</p>

<p>To sort a list, you can supply a <code>key: Callable=(...)</code> keyword argument. We want to supply the above distance function to sort by. I'm using <code>functools.partial</code> to "bake in" the characters data, but you could also declare the function inside your sorting function and leave the argument definition out.</p>

<p>Then return a list like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>from functools import partial

def sort_closest(character: Tuple[int, int], enemies: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -&gt; List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """
    Finds the closest enemy in enemies

    :param character: An (x, y) representing the position of the character\n
    :param enemies: A list of tuples (x, y) that represent enemies

    :return: A tuple (x, y) of the closest enemy
    """
    return sorted(enemies, key=partial(distance, character))
</code></pre>

<p>Then retrieve the closest enemy with:</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>closest = sort_closest(player, enemies)[0]
</code></pre>

<p>Note: I also included @I0b0's typing reccomendation. You could of course omit the <code>math.sqrt</code> function in <code>distance()</code> if you <em>only</em> use it for sorting, but then you'd have to also rename it to not be "distance".</p>

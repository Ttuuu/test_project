<p>It seems that the reuse of the ids causes some problems. You write that you expect "many" entries, but do you have a more precise estimate of what "many" means in respect to application run/life time. In other words: is it even possible to reach int.MaxValue taken the expected traffic compared to the duration of a running session? For instance: if you expect 2 bitmaps per second, how many years will it take to reach max?</p>

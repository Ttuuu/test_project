<p>I have some suggestions, some regarding the code and some regarding the logic of it. Generally this is a nice code.<br>
Let's begin, logical suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First of all, the code does not run. <code>SyntaxError: name 'newUser' is used prior to global declaration</code>. You should put the <code>global</code> keyword before declaring the variables.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the <code>__main__</code> function. Usually when writing a good python code you do not write logic outside of functions. This will make your code more readable. You can than put the logic in a <code>while True</code> loop and keep accept users forever and not just twice.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Coding suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Magic numbers. The number of time you can accept a wrong password is 3, make it a constant: <code>NUMBER_OF_ERROR = 3</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>You do not need to declare <code>x</code> outside of the <code>login</code> function.</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of <code>x += 5</code> just use break, it makes much more sense.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not call the login function at the end of login. It creates unnecessary recursion.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That's it.<br>
Good luck and have fun</p>

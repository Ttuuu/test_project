<p>Your problem is at least as hard as 3SUM, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3SUM" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3SUM</a> (in fact it is very likely equivalent with a little thought).</p>

<p>Let us first see how to reduce a 3SUM problem to your problem.</p>

<p>3SUM says I have an array <span class="math-container">\$X\$</span>, and I want to find out if there are <span class="math-container">\$x\$</span>, <span class="math-container">\$y\$</span>, <span class="math-container">\$z\$</span> in <span class="math-container">\$X\$</span> such that <span class="math-container">$$x + y + z = 0$$</span></p>

<p>Let us define <span class="math-container">\$A = X\$</span> and <span class="math-container">\$B = [-a\ \$</span> for <span class="math-container">\$ a \$</span> in <span class="math-container">\$ A]\$</span></p>

<p>Then let us solve your problem, i.e. determine if there are <span class="math-container">\$x\$</span> and <span class="math-container">\$y\$</span> in <span class="math-container">\$A\$</span> such that <span class="math-container">\$x + y\$</span> is in <span class="math-container">\$B\$</span>, that is, there is some <span class="math-container">\$z\$</span> in <span class="math-container">\$A\$</span> such that <span class="math-container">\$x + y = -z\$</span>, then we have determined whether <span class="math-container">\$X\$</span> has <span class="math-container">\$x\$</span>, <span class="math-container">\$y\$</span>, <span class="math-container">\$z\$</span> such that <span class="math-container">\$x+y+z=0\$</span>.</p>

<p>Ergo, suppose we can solve your problem in better than <span class="math-container">\$O(nm)\$</span> time (and not such that the case <span class="math-container">\$n=m\$</span> doesn't magically reduce to <span class="math-container">\$n^2\$</span>) where <span class="math-container">\$|A| = n\$</span> and <span class="math-container">\$|B| = m\$</span></p>

<p>Then for a 3SUM problem we could reduce it to your problem and solve that, thus solving the 3SUM problem in better than <span class="math-container">\$O(n^2)\$</span> time (in this case <span class="math-container">\$n = m\$</span>)</p>

<p>Given that it's a long standing conjecture whether you can do <span class="math-container">\$O(n^{2-e})\$</span> for some <span class="math-container">\$e &gt; 0\$</span> for 3SUM I'm inclined to suggest you aren't going to find better than <span class="math-container">\$O(nm)\$</span>, ignoring that as detailed in the wikipedia link above there are actually marginally better time complexities which have been achieved.</p>

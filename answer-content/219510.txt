<p>Every time you feel obliged to put a comment like</p>

<pre><code>    // Start filling up left array
</code></pre>

<p>you really deal with a potentially important algorithm, which deserves a name, and a method of its own. In this case the algorithm is known as <em>partial product</em>. Consider factoring it out, and see the comments disappear.</p>

<p>Ditto for the second loop.</p>

<p>Regarding space complexity,</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You don't need <code>left</code>: accumulate the partial products directly into <code>output</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>You don't need <code>right</code> as well: instead of accumulating the partial products, use it immediately:</p>

<pre><code>    temp = 1;

    for (int i = size - 1; i &gt;= 0; i--) {
        output[i] *= temp;
        temp = temp * nums[i];
    }
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

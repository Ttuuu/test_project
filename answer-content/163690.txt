<p>To increase performance you could use the concept of <code>Binary search</code>: </p>

<ol>
<li>look at the <code>length/2</code> index (= Split the array in two parts)</li>
<li>If this value contains data take the right array-part, if not the left and start at step 1 again.</li>
<li>if your remaning array has length 1 you found your index</li>
</ol>

<p>I did not test my 'code' but you will get the idea, how it works. This code will only work if you have no empty indices between the data.</p>

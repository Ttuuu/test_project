<p>I like it.</p>

<p>There are only a few things I would reconsider:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>detectedId</code> is a clunky name, <code>clickedId</code> or <code>selectedId</code> seems better</li>
<li>You hardcode <code>4</code>, at least use a constant, ideally detect how many buttons there dynamically</li>
<li>The treatment for the first button is different enough that it can be placed outside of the loop</li>
<li><p>It seems you only need to know which button was clicked, which can be found by analyzing the selected id</p>

<pre><code>if(selectedId === "btn1"){
  $(".cont-img div").css("left", "0%");
}else{
  let id = selectedId.split('btn')[1]*1;
  $(".cont-img div").css("left", "-" + (id - 1) + "00%");
}
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>This way you dont even need to hardcode <code>4</code></p>
    </div>

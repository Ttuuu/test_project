<h1>docstring</h1>

<p>Your original method is adequately docmented, but you can format your docstring also according to a general style. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/24385103/1562285">This SO answer</a> covers some of the templates.</p>

<h1>doctest</h1>

<p>If you format your example in the correct way, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">doctest</a> to test it. This format is also recognised by Sphinx and other documentation tools, </p>

<h1>alternative approach</h1>

<p>Another approach would be to use a <code>collections.defaultdict(list)</code></p>

<pre><code>def match_ends(list1):
    result = defaultdict(list)
    for item in list1:
        result[item[-1]].append(item)
    return result
</code></pre>

<p>This way you don't have to sort the list first, but need to append to it. If you use python &gt;3.6, the original method will also return a alphabetically sorted dict, while this method will be sorted along the occurrence in the original list.</p>

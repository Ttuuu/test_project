<h2>Whitespace, let your code breathe</h2>

<p>Your code has a few logical sections, you should use empty lines to break them appart visually. It makes your code easier to read.</p>

<h2>Personal opinion: front-load your type aliases</h2>

<p>General wisdom in C++ is to define things as close as possible to their first use, but that's generally meant for objects with lifetimes. I personally prefer to put any type alias at the start of its scope.</p>

<h2>algorithm is unused, so it should not be included</h2>

<p>Simple enough: do not <code>#include</code> stuff you don't need.</p>

<p>That's kind of it, really, good job!</p>

<p>Edit: to answer your question, you could finagle something with <code>std::accumulate</code>, or just create a scope for partial_sum, but it's not worth the trouble. What you have it fine.</p>

<p>It indeed looks like your code is O(n), I atleast can't find a reason for it not to be. Although I would recommend some better variable names and breaking out done functions.</p>

<p>Your code uses <code>Reader</code> which to my knowledge is unbuffered and thus very slow. It is reasonably common for inappropriate IO code in Java programming challenges to cause TLE even for the correct algorithm. Considering you're reading up to one million ints per test case, this could be your suspect.</p>

<p>Try wrapping the <code>Reader</code> in a <code>BufferedReader</code> .</p>

<p>While I believe that the system out stream is buffered, you can also build the output into a <code>StringBuilder</code> to see if that makes a difference.</p>

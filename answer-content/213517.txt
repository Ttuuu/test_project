<li><p>Write code in English</p>

<p>English should be the preferred language to write code in.</p>

<p>It makes it easier for other people (for instance on this site) to understand what the code is doing.</p></li>
<li><p>Python comes with batteries included</p>

<p>This means whenever possible make use of the modules that are in the standard library, in this case you could make use of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.groupby" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>groupby</code> function from the itertools package</a></p>

<p>This function just groups data together with whatever <code>key</code> you supply</p></li>
<li><p>Use list comprehension when possible</p>

<p>This is not only considered Pythonic, it should also be a bit faster</p></li>

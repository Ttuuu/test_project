<p>This is the "constant frequency" optimization mentioned in the comments, it is of course situational..</p>

<p>Sine and cosine are what happens to coordinates of a unit vector that is rotated around the origin, which means that a sequence like <code>sin(start + k*rate)</code> can be generated by starting a unit vector at the starting point <code>[cos(start), sin(start)]</code> and then successively multiplying it by the rotation matrix</p>

<pre><code>[[cos(rate), -sin(rate)],
 [sin(rate),  cos(rate)]]
</code></pre>

<p>To generate each of the values, with the result being the Y coordinate of the resulting vectors.</p>

<p>So for a stretch of audio in which the frequency is not itself warped (amplitude can be varied on top of this though and that ends up causing some frequency-spread of its own), only a pair of sine and cosine are needed, the rest happens with multiplication and addition. But of course this does not help if the frequency does change all the time.</p>

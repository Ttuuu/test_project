<p>Your <code>newarr</code> doesn't need to be twice the size of <code>arr</code>, since you're already checking if <code>i+x&lt;n</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Also,</p>

<pre><code>else
    if (i + x &gt;= n) {
</code></pre>

<p>could just be replaced with <code>else</code>, since the previous condition is <code>if(i + x &lt; n)</code> and it already takes care of the only other possible case.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now that I think about it, you don't need that whole if/else structure. If you're trying to keep the result smaller than n, modulus will do that for you. <code>if (i+x &gt;= n) { b = i+x-n }</code> could just be replaced with the modulus operator - <code>b = (i+x) % n</code></p>

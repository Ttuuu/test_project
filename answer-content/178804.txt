<p>This is to expand on Austin Hastings comment.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#typeiter" rel="noreferrer">Python Standard Library</a> documentation,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The intention of the protocol is that once an iteratorâ€™s next() method raises StopIteration, it will continue to do so on subsequent calls. Implementations that do not obey this property are deemed broken.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It means that once the underlying iterator raises <code>StopIteration</code>, your object shall not accept any more push backs.</p>

<hr>

<p>I would call the list <code>lookahead</code> rather than <code>pushed_back</code>, but it is a matter of taste.</p>

<hr>

<p>Otherwise, LGTM.</p>

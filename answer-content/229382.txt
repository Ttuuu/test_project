<h3>Good Practices</h3>

<ul>
<li>✔ I like the fact you don't rotate if the array's length is a multiplication of <code>K</code>.</li>
<li>✔ As you stated in the comments, the second array <code>B</code> gets created too early, since in some occasions it would be created in vain.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Review</h3>

<ul>
<li>The challenge is clearly written for Java:<code>class Solution { public int[] solution(int[] A, int K); }</code>. The provided signature deserves its own review (casing conventions, static members, meaningful member names). However, if you 'cannot' change the signature given to you, I would be consistent and use <code>N</code> instead of <code>len</code> for the array's length.</li>
<li>You sometimes return the provided array and sometimes create a new one. I would make this very clear in the specification. A consumer should know whether or when a copy is returned. This affects further usage of the object.</li>
<li>You should guard against the source array being null.</li>
<li>How would you handle a negative value of <code>K</code>? If you think about it, a left rotation is just the inverse of a right rotation.</li>
<li>Nested statements could have been prevented by inverting the if-statement and exiting early. Less nested statements generally increase readability.</li>
<li>For bigger arrays you should check <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.buffer.blockcopy?view=netframework-4.8" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Buffer.BlockCopy</a> to optimize copying sections of an array to another array. You could see a rotation as copying 2 sections from one array to another given a pivot. Check out <a href="https://jorgecandeias.github.io/2019/02/23/algorithm-cyclic-rotation-in-csharp/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this article</a> about the subject.</li>
<li>If you can change the signature, make a static class with static method, use a meaningful method name <code>RotateRight</code> with arguments <code>array</code> and <code>count</code> and make it clear whether in-place rotation is performed or a new array is created.</li>
</ul>

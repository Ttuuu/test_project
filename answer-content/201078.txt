<p>In addition to <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/13424/adriano-repetti">Adriano Repetti</a> <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/201067/120556">answer</a> I would like to add some additional points.</p>

<ul>
<li>You should not include debugging code in your release code.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your <code>postVote</code> function</p>

<pre><code>postVote() {
    axios({
        url: this.url,
        method: 'post',
        data: { "idea": { "id": this.id  }}
    })
    .then((data) =&gt; {
        console.log(`${data}: Posted vote`); // &lt;&lt; this is a debug output
    })
    .catch((data) =&gt; {
        console.log(data);  // &lt;&lt; this is a debug output
    })
}
</code></pre>

<p>The two calls to console are in my opinion rude. Only output to a console you have access to IE your development platforms, and treat the clients console as a private out of bounds area.</p>

<ul>
<li>You don't need to wrap property names in quotes unless the names are not valid JS names eg <code>"some-prop" : data,</code>, and it is also inconsistent with the rest of your code that does not do this.</li>
</ul>

<p>From above snippet</p>

<pre><code> data: { "idea": { "id": this.id  }}
 // should be 
 data: { idea: { id: this.id  }}  
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Code style is up to the individual but be constant in the style you use. You are using semicolons for some lines yet not on others. Use them on all lines that invoke automatic semicolon insertion  (preferably) or on none, don't mix.</li>
</ul>

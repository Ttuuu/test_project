<p>Things like this can be confusing:</p>

<pre><code>age = 100 - int(age)
currentYear += age
</code></pre>

<p><code>age</code> <em>starts off</em> being the user's age, but then it gets changed to mean something different, and the name has become misleading.  Similarly for <code>currentYear</code>.  It may be better to introduce new variables, like this:</p>

<pre><code>time_until_100 = 100 - int(age)
future_year = currentYear + time_until_100
</code></pre>

<p>Or to inline the calculation:</p>

<pre><code>age = int(age)
print(name, "is going to be 100 by", currentYear - age + 100)
</code></pre>

<p>Or a compromise between the two</p>

<pre><code>birth_year = currentYear - int(age)
print(name, "is going to be 100 by", birth_year + 100)
</code></pre>

<p>Perhaps this last one is clearest (though <code>birth_year</code> is only an estimate, given we don't know whether the user has had a birthday yet this year).</p>

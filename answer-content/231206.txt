<p>The code contain a major logical flaw.</p>

<p>I tried to correct my question but @Mast made me notice that this is against the rules, sorry for my mistake.</p>

<p>In the section of the code that uses the boxes there is a for loop to generate the lists points_x1c and points_y1c. In that section there is a wrong "if" statement.</p>

<pre><code> for (int i = 0; i &lt; max_box_x; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j &lt; max_box_y; ++j) {    
            vector &lt;double&gt; points_x1c, points_y1c, points_x2c, points_y2c;
            for (int k = 0; k &lt; box_x1.size(); ++k) {
                if ((box_x1[k] == i || box_x1[k] == i + 1 || box_x1[k] == i - 1) &amp;&amp;
                    (box_y1[k] == j || box_y1[k] == j + 1 || box_y1[k] == j - 1)) {
                    points_x1c.push_back(x1[k]);
                    points_y1c.push_back(y1[k]);
                }
            }
</code></pre>

<p>The correct code should be the following:</p>

<pre><code> for (int i = 0; i &lt; max_box_x; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j &lt; max_box_y; ++j) {    
            vector &lt;double&gt; points_x1c, points_y1c, points_x2c, points_y2c;
            for (int k = 0; k &lt; box_x1.size(); ++k) {
                if (box_x1[k] == i &amp;&amp; box_y1[k] == j) {
                    points_x1c.push_back(x1[k]);
                    points_y1c.push_back(y1[k]);
                }
            }
</code></pre>

<p>This is because, for the lists points_x1c and points_y1c (logically the points belonging to a specific type) you need to take only the values for the box "i,j".
Obviously all the other suggestions given in the other answers still remains, the code can be better written and standardized by using these guidelines.</p>

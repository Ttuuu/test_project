<p>This looks to me like it will work as intended. I have a few suggestions for improvement though:</p>

<ul>
<li>You keep the <code>count</code> variable up to date but never use it's value for anything. You can either remove it or provide a <code>size()</code> method.</li>
<li>You might change your <code>push()</code> method to</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>public void push(Object item){
   top = new Node(item, top);
   count++;
}
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>If <code>top</code> is <code>null</code>, you set <code>node.next</code> to <code>null</code> in the Node constructor anyways.
 - If you do this, you can subsequently delete the Node(Item) constructor</p>

<ul>
<li>I personally would make the <code>item</code> and <code>next</code> member variables in Node <code>final</code> to prevent accidental mutations</li>
<li>(Instead of accepting <code>Object</code> as your items you might want to introduce <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/extra/generics/intro.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Generics</a> into your class. But this is an advanced topic and is maybe too hard for you as a beginner)</li>
</ul>

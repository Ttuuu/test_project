<p>So after a lot of testing I found something that significantly reduces calculation time. Converting the format of my dfm to a different sparse format saves significant time when subsetting my main matrix (dfm).</p>

<pre><code>dfm&lt;-as(dfm,"dgCMatrix")
</code></pre>

<p>This took my calculation time from approximately 11-12 seconds per line, to .2 seconds per line. As I understand it, this is because dgCMatrix format is optimized for subsetting by columns/column operations which is the first subsetting operation in my function. If you were wanting to subset by rows the optimal format would be RsparseMatrix, optimized for rows.</p>

<pre><code>dfm&lt;-as(dfm,"RsparseMatrix")
</code></pre>

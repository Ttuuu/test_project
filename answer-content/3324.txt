<p>I'm definitely <em>not</em> a Haskell expert, but here are my 2 cents:</p>

<ul>
<li>You should break your main functions in several methods. The amount of code running inside the IO monad should be minimized.</li>
<li>You often use <code>case ... of</code> where a separate function with pattern matching would be more readable  </li>
<li><code>albumName</code> could use a fold</li>
</ul>

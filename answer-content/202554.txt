<p>These are both reasonable ways to do what you're trying to do, but I think you've missed an opportunity to make this even easier. Instead of having a class that only has a <code>setX()</code>/<code>setY()</code>, why not make some operators for doing math on your points? I would start by removing the default constructor via:</p>

<pre><code> point() = delete;
</code></pre>

<p>Then I would add something like:</p>

<pre><code>point operator+(const point&amp; rhs);
point&amp; operator+=(const point&amp; rhs);
</code></pre>

<p>I would stop thinking about separate <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinates as much as possible and start thinking about points, locations, velocities, etc. This would allow you to write your code as:</p>

<pre><code>point playerPos = player.get_position();

switch (input) {
    case MOVE_UP:
        processPlayerMove(player, playerPos + point(0, -1));
</code></pre>

<p>I strongly dislike option 2 because it treats a single entity, the point, as 2 different values, when they really are a single thing.</p>

<p>Your first query will only keep 1 value for <code>&lt;fs_curr_tab&gt;-table_description</code> so you might as well go for </p>

<pre><code>  SELECT SINGLE ddtext AS table_description
  FROM dd02t
  INTO &lt;fs_curr_tab&gt;-table_description
  WHERE tabname = &lt;fs_curr_tab&gt;-table_id AND ddlanguage = 'EN'.
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>AS table_description</code> is not needed since you are not using <code>CORRESPONDING</code>, I also do not like the hardcoded language, I would take the user language. I also prefer <code>EQ</code> over <code>=</code></p>

<pre><code>  SELECT SINGLE ddtext
  FROM dd02t
  INTO &lt;fs_curr_tab&gt;-table_description
  WHERE tabname EQ &lt;fs_curr_tab&gt;-table_id 
    AND ddlanguage EQ sy-langu.
</code></pre>

<p>If this is called with a large amount of tables (say over 50), then you should definitely consider reading all the table names at once with <code>FOR ALL ENTRIES IN</code> before the loop.</p>

<p>Finally, this could go horribly wrong if that table does not have an 'ID' column. If it were me I would check first the DD03L table to make sure the table does have an ID column. If I am not mistaken, DBIF_RSQL_INVALID_REQUEST is a non-catchable exception and would send the program straight into an abend.</p>

<p>You aren't using loops or functions, so I assume you haven't learned them yet.</p>

<p>Your code is clean and readable, for the most part, so let me suggest just a few changes.</p>

<p>First, see <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP-8</a>. It's the coding standard for Python (like it or not). Many of the issues I have with your code will be fixed by conforming to that standard: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>spaces between operands and operators</p></li>
<li><p><code>snake_case</code> names</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Next, be aware that Python has an exponent operator, <code>**</code> you can use for your computations. </p>

<p>Your comments are correct, but add no value. Delete any comment that simply explains in English what the next line obviously does in Python.</p>

<p>Finally, apply the DRY principle: <em>don't repeat yourself!</em> Those <code>if...elif...else</code> statements in each block are the same, since the index values are normalized. Move them to the bottom, after your first <code>if else</code> (Freedom vs. Metric units) and set the index to some bogus value in your error case.</p>

<h3>Design Decision</h3>

<p>You have designed the defaults to be both including the start and end.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code> include_start = kwargs.get('include_start', True)
 include_end = kwargs.get('include_end', True)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>However, for continuous ranges a better default is to exclude the end. Why? Because we cannot expect the values to be discretes (hence, 'continous' range). In continous functions, an included end would need to defined as the excluded end minus some sort of <em>epsilon</em>. This is very tedious and cumbersome practice. </p>

<p>Example in pseudo code: <code>01/01/2000 - 01/01/2001</code> is much cleaner than <code>01/01/2000 - 12/31/2000 23:59:59.999999</code>.</p>

<p>Change your default for the end item to be excluded.</p>

<pre><code>  include_start = kwargs.get('include_start', True)
  include_end = kwargs.get('include_end', False)
</code></pre>

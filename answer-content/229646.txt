<p>Your implementation is interesting, but it does not save from waiting in some cases:
If two users U1 and U2 switch on simultaneously and U2 switch was handled after U1, then U1 have to wait 500 ms for switch-off.</p>

<p>I have following suggestion: What if we just compare <code>currentSwitchState</code> and <code>lastSwitchState</code> and state can be result of this comparison:</p>

<pre><code>if (currentSwitchState != lastSwitchState) {
    light.state = currentSwitchState &gt; lastSwitchState;
}
enter code here
</code></pre>

<p>In this case we can remove waiting and some code.</p>

<p>I hope it makes sense. :)</p>

<p>If you want to time something, you should time just that. When I ran your original code, I got  6.023478031158447 seconds. When I instead did</p>

<pre><code>start_time = time.time()
result = list(Median(data))
end_time = time.time()
print("Result: ", result, end_time-start_time)
</code></pre>

<p>I got  1.8368241786956787. Note that calling <code>time.time()</code> before the <code>print</code> statement means that the execution of the <code>print</code> statement isn't included in your calculation of elapsed time.</p>

<p>I also tried </p>

<pre><code>import statistics
start_time = time.time()
result = statistics.median(data)
end_time = time.time()
print("Result: ", result, end_time-start_time)
</code></pre>

<p>and got 0.7475762367248535. </p>

<p>What do mean by "not using heap", and why do you want that? What makes you think SortedList doesn't use a heap? If you're going to use pre-made functions, why not just use the pre-made <code>median</code> function?</p>

<p>Welcome to Code Review, I have seen your code and I have seen you encapsulated your <code>createQuery</code> method like below:</p>
<pre><code>try { body method } catch (Exception exception) { exception.printStackTrace(); }
</code></pre>
<p>You are basically catching all <code>NullPointerException</code> cases and other runtime exceptions you can meet within your method with the <code>Exception</code> class, this is a sign something should be redesigned to avoid these situations.</p>
<p>About the paradigm you are following , you are implementing a personal version of the <em>repository pattern</em>, referring to structures like the jpa repository present for example in the spring framework. You can check while you are creating different queries worrying about the construction of a valid query (and this is the reason why you had to encapsulate your method in the <code>try catch</code> construct), it should be better using an already built class to do the same things with much less effort.</p>

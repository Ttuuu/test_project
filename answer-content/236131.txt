<p>As I understand the code, it 1) determines a minimum number of steps (a "radius") before a particle could run into a sticky point or the edge and 2) randomly moves to a point based on a pre-calculated multinomial distribution for that number of steps.  The selected point could be anywhere within the determined "radius".</p>

<p>It seems that for a particle to reach a sticky point or the edge, it must first reach the circumference of the area defined by the radius.  Therefore, for each step, it would suffice for the particle to jump to a randomly select point on the circumference of that area.  And, because the area is symmetrical, it seems the points on the circumference are all equally probable.</p>

<p>This would let the particle make large jumps when it is far away from anything and  take small steps when it is near something.</p>

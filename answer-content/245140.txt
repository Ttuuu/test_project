<h1>Remove commented out code</h1>
<p>All the code that has been commented out distracts from the actual code. You commented it out for a reason: you don't need it anymore.</p>
<h1>Type Hints</h1>
<p>These help the user see what is accepted by a function, and what is returned by a function. It's helpful when you need to remember what functions accept what types of values.</p>
<pre><code>from typing import List

def count(board: List[List[int]]) -&gt; int:
    ....
</code></pre>
<h1><code>create_grid</code></h1>
<p>To be frank, this function is really messy. You indent <em><strong>nine</strong></em> times. I would break this into smaller functions that handle different parts of creating the grid.</p>

<p>Neither the fixed position of the header nor the positioning of the background image is achievable with flexbox.</p>

<p>You can replace <code>fixed</code> with <code>sticky</code>. This fixes the offset of the background image for <code>.hero</code> (<code>sticky</code> effects the flow of elements). This also allows us to drop the <code>width</code> attribute which is incorrectly set to <code>width: 100%</code> (should be <code>width: calc(100% - 48px)</code>) and thus fix so that the entire header is visible.</p>

<p>I think you should use <code>background-image</code>. I agree with <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/4216214/3755425">this</a> post stating you don't need an alt for a background image. And there's decent support for <a href="https://caniuse.com/#search=image-set" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the image-set css property</a> (although I don't have experience with this property myself).</p>

<p>There's an inconsistency between <code>to_base64</code> which maps integers to <em>host characters</em> and <code>from_base64</code> which maps (char-sized) <em>integers</em> to integer values.  The two transforms are consistent only when the host character coding represents the base-64 characters with the same code-points as in ASCII; not all character sets do so.</p>

<p>The correct portable way to fix this is to derive the decoder table from the encoder table.</p>

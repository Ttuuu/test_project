<p>Your algorithm can be summarized by the pseudocode:</p>

<pre><code>for each position in the array
    if a position is occupied by the wrong number
        find the number that fits into the position
        perform a swap
</code></pre>

<p>A better algorithm would be:</p>

<pre><code>for each position in the array
    if a number is in the wrong location
        find the position the number should go
        perform a swap
</code></pre>

<p>This is because finding a number for a given location requires a linear scan, but finding the location for a given number is as simple as it gets: the number five should go into the fifth position.</p>

<p>The full program could look like this (in python, as I don't speak js):</p>

<pre><code>def minimumSwaps(arr):
    def swap(i, j):
        arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
    swaps = 0
    for i in range(0, len(arr)):
        while arr[i]-1 != i:
            swap(i, arr[i]-1)
            swaps += 1
    return swaps
</code></pre>

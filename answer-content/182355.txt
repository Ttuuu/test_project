<p>Catching exceptions the way you do is not useful. For example if the <code>D2_KEY</code> environment variable isn't present, it's clear that the request will ultimately fail. Similarly if <code>self.data = result['Response']</code> raises an exception then <code>self.data</code> is <code>None</code> which means that <code>member_data = member_data['results']</code> fails with <code>TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable</code>. Only catch the exception if you can actually do something useful about it. Similarly if the status or error code is unexpected, it's fine to display some useful data like the actual code value, but raise an exception right there to show the failure.</p>

<p>The <code>ResponseSummary</code> class could just be replaced by a method returning <code>data</code>. There are times when classes are helpful, but this is not one of them.</p>

<p>With these two things in mind, you can greatly simplify your code. </p>

<p>Some of your switch cases are unnecessarily long, repetitive and include lots of code. </p>

<p>You could easily replace them with indexed arrays, making it easier to read, shorter, and easier to expand with more values later.</p>

<p>For example, instead of </p>

<pre><code>switch(Level){
    case 1:
        enemyhp = 9;
        enemymeleedmg = 1;
        break;
    case 2:
        enemyhp = 19;
        enemymeleedmg = 4;
        break;
    case 3:
        enemyhp = 24;
        enemymeleedmg = 6;
        break;
    case 4:
        enemyhp = 32;
        enemymeleedmg = 7;
        break;
    case 5:
        enemyhp = 40;
        enemymeleedmg = 9;
        break; //initializes enemy stats based on player level
    }
</code></pre>

<p>You could do</p>

<pre><code>int[] enemyHpArray = {1, 9, 19, 24, 32, 40};
int[] enemyMeleedmgArray = {1, 1, 4, 6, 7, 9};
enemyhp = enemyHpArray[Level];
enemymeleedmg = enemyMeleedmgArray[Level];
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I put the value <code>1</code> at the index 0, just to avoid putting a 0 there. It looks like you wouldn't use the 0 index of the array, but in case you do by accident, it may reduce the risk of crashing the game due to hp/damage being unintentinally set to 0.</p>

<p>Another possibility is to put only your <em>actual</em> values <code>{9, 19, 24, 32, 40}</code> in the array and then index on <code>enemyHpArray[Level-1];</code> , but I personally think that would be more confusing/less readable code.</p>

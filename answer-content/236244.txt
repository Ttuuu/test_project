<p>Comment about your naming conventions. Statements such as <code>current = original</code> show that you conflate the array and the pointer view of things. Clearly <code>original</code> refers to a string, whereas <code>current</code> seems to be "the current location in the string". (I would be almost tempted to write <code>current = &amp;(original[0])</code> just to show what's happening.)</p>

<p>However, the name <code>current</code> gives no indication of what type it is: a current <em>what?</em>. Also, the expression <code>*current</code> indicates that current is not "current character" but "pointer to current character".</p>

<p>How about you use more descriptive names, such as "pointer_into_original_string"?</p>

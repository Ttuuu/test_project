<h1>Decision loops</h1>

<p>Your implementation of a decision loop is... interesting to say the least. If you're using <code>python-3.8</code>, you can utilize the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/walrus-operator-in-python-3-8/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">walrus operator</a>. It's a way to assign variables within an expression. In this case, the <code>while</code> loop. Have a look:</p>

<pre><code>def choice(prompt: str) -&gt; bool: # replaced "yn" with "choice" #
    print(prompt)
    while decision := input("Y/N: ").lower():
        if decision in "yn":
            return decision == "y"
        print("Invalid input!")
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of just returning <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>, you can return the boolean expression that evaluates to a boolean. It's the same thing you're doing, but a lot simpler.</p>

<h1>Type Hints</h1>

<p>Using type hints help you and other people reading your code know what types of parameters are accepted and what types are returned by functions. If you look at the function above, you can see that <code>prompt</code> is a <code>str</code>, and the function returns a <code>bool</code> value.</p>

<h1>Dealing with exceptions</h1>

<pre><code>def save_clear():
    try:
        os.remove(os.path.abspath('save.pkl'))
    except Exception:
        pass
</code></pre>

<p>Passing on an exception isn't a good idea. An Exception is raised, and you're essentially ignoring it. I would print an error message to the console, such as <code>"ERROR: File not found!"</code> or something related. Just to tell you whats wrong, instead of having an exception and not knowing what specifically is wrong. You should also try to catch specific exceptions if you can.</p>

<h1>Consistency</h1>

<p>You use three different ways to concatenate strings in your program. <code>.format</code>, <code>f""</code> and <code>+</code>. Use one method and stick to it. I would recommend <code>f""</code> because it allows you to directly include variables in your strings, rather than having to call a function (<code>.format</code>) to add them.</p>

<h1>Globals</h1>

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/19158418/8968906">It's not recommended to use globals</a>. They can have unseen consequences, increase the complexity of your program, and can lead to spaghetti code. I would try to find a way to write this program without using globals.</p>

<h1>Boolean Comparison</h1>

<p>Instead of</p>

<pre><code>if new_game_test == True:
</code></pre>

<p>do this</p>

<pre><code>if new_game_test:
</code></pre>

<p><code>new_game_test</code> is a boolean value in itself, so you can just check that value. </p>

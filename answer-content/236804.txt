<p>See the problem? Exceptions were invented to release the libraries from the burden to guess what beahiour the user wants for all kind of errors. Libraries shall not <code>print</code> but leave it to the caller. The caller is the only one to know how to react on different kind of exceptions. So if you catch, be specific.</p>

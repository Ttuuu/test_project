<p>The walkFileTree method is a sample of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle" rel="nofollow noreferrer">dependency inversion</a> violation on method level. Instead of being given the path and the action to perform, the method is burdened with the depenendencies of finding the information itself. This is what increases the ABC value of the method. The problem is highlighted by the method having a very generic name <code>walkFileTree</code> but performing a very specific task instead : walking the directory beneath <code>rootDirectory</code> and adding the entries to a specific dictionary.</p>

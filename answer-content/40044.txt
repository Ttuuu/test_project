<p>I'll focus on problems in <code>compare()</code>.</p>

<p>You're using the wrong equality comparison for the bitmap size.  You need to compare the contents of the <code>Size</code> objects, not whether they are the same reference.</p>

<p>A variable named <code>flag</code> should be aâ€¦ <em>red flag</em>!  Not only is it vaguely named, its presence suggests that your code is ineffective.  Avoid using variables for flow control; find more active ways to get to where you need to go.</p>

<p>In this case, the solution is an early <code>return</code>.  As soon as you find a single difference between the two images, you're done!  You don't even need the <code>equals</code> variable.</p>

<p>I would also rename <code>compare()</code> for clarity, and make it <code>static</code> because it is a pure function of its two parameters.</p>

<pre><code>private static bool Equals(Bitmap bmp1, Bitmap bmp2) 
{
    if (!bmp1.Size.Equals(bmp2.Size))
    {
        return false;
    }
    for (int x = 0; x &lt; bmp1.Width; ++x)
    {
        for (int y = 0; y &lt; bmp1.Height; ++y)
        {
            if (bmp1.GetPixel(x, y) != bmp2.GetPixel(x, y))
            {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
}
</code></pre>

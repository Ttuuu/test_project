<p>I figured out how to cross-compile to windows using mingw compiler. When I run this app in Windows natively, it runs much faster, well over 200fps on my laptop at 900x900 instead of 40-60fps. I believe if I was running this natively on linux and not with wsl2 I would have never had performance concerns.</p>

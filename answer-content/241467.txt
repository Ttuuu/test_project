<p>Don't deal in NUL terminated strings.  The problem is that there are characters that will "encrypt" to NUL.  (In this case, notably, 'K', 'E', and 'Y'.)  This means you need to pass in the length of the text.  </p>

<p>If you want to allow for future expansion, allow for the possibility that the output text may be longer than the input text.  Dynamic allocation may be appropriate, or maybe you have an auxiliary function that says "for a text of length x, what is the longest length of output text."  It may also then be appropriate to pass in the output buffer length, and pass out the output used length.</p>

<p>Also allow for the specifying the operation (encrypt/decrypt).  This "encryption" doesn't need it, but most symmetric encryptions do.</p>

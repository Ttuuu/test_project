<p>This issue is being discussed on the <a href="https://github.com/serilog/serilog-aspnetcore/issues/141" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Serilog integration for ASP.NET Core</a> repository. Nicholas Blumhardt has proposed a <a href="https://gist.github.com/nblumhardt/34c0c273c383da9745f4e974f12b9cac" rel="nofollow noreferrer">draft</a> for a <em>late init sink</em> that would be used like this:</p>

<pre><code>var signalRSink = new LateInitSink();

Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
    .WriteTo.Sink(signalRSink)
    .CreateLogger();

Log.Information("Sadly, nobody will get this");

// ... resolve that hub ...
signalRSink.Init(wt =&gt; wt.Console());

Log.Information("Ah so nice to be loggin' again");
</code></pre>

<p>The final version is not yet implemented. Quoting Nicholas Blumhardt from the aforementioned issue:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yes, it's still being considered - just a matter of someone finding the time to dig in deeply/write some code. Cheers!</p>

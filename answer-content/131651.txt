<p>It's great that you've put the questions and answers in arrays. You can take further advantage of that in your <code>for</code> loop. Notice how you're always looking at the place in the array that's indexed on less than <code>num</code>? You can use <code>num - 1</code> as an array index. That eliminates all the duplication in your loop body.</p>

<pre><code>for num in question:
    user_answer = input(questions[num - 1])
    if user_answer.lower() == answers[num - 1]:
        print("Correct\n")
        score += 1
    else:
        print("Incorrect\n")
</code></pre>

<p>As mentioned in the comments by Sisoma Munden, <code>score = score + 1</code> can be turned into <code>score += 1</code>. This works for other arithmetic operators too (<code>someVar *= 3</code> multiplies <code>someVar</code> by three).</p>

<p>You've also hardcoded the number of questions (in the <code>random.sample</code> line). You can get the length/count of a Python array by passing it to <code>len</code>. For instance, <code>len(questions)</code> is the number of items in the <code>questions</code> array. Therefore, you can replace the <code>random.sample</code> line with this:</p>

<pre><code>question = random.sample(range(1, len(questions) + 1), len(questions))
</code></pre>

<p>Then your score-displaying line becomes this (I fixed the display as well, <code>+</code> concatenates strings together, the <code>str</code> function gets the text representation of a number):</p>

<pre><code>print("Your final score is" + str(score) + " out of " + str(len(questions)) + "\n")
</code></pre>

<p>Come to think of it, I used <code>len(questions)</code> a lot there. You might consider declaring a variable for that after your arrays:</p>

<pre><code>questionCount = len(questions)
</code></pre>

<p>You can then use that in place of <code>len(questions)</code>.</p>

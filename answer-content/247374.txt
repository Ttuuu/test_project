<p>Ok, I need to be honest here: This code is atrocious. You are virtually breaking every rule in the book. And considering the work you put into the introduction, I have to assume you do it on purpose. My general advice would be: Put the effort you do into your code and then you'll won't need to write so much documentation.</p>
<p>I won't even go into the formatting issues, because I'd have to copy and paste a complete style guide here. Go out and read some of the existing <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=javascript%20style%20guide" rel="nofollow noreferrer">style guides</a> and apply them to your code. Or if that is too much work, install and use a code formatter in your editor/IDE/build tools.</p>
<p>If you want to optimize code execution use a minifier for the production code, but don't use syntax just to write as little code/as few lines as possible, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't use of the comma operator. At all. Especially not in the <code>return</code> expression like you are. Why don't just place the <code>map</code> before the <code>return</code>? (BTW, you are misusing <code>map</code> here. It should be a <code>forEach</code> or a <code>reduce</code> instead.)</li>
<li>Don't misuse deconstrution assignments just to press as much code as possible into one line.</li>
<li>Don't use <code>&amp;&amp;</code> as a replacement for <code>if</code>.</li>
<li>Don't reuse variables, such as the <code>Num</code> parameter.</li>
</ul>

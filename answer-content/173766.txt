<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>if you don't need the bookmarks instances then I would be inclined to go for something like:</p>

<pre><code>@coaches = Coach
             .joins(:bookmarks).includes(:user)
             .where(bookmarks: { bookmarkable_type: "Coach", client: @client })
</code></pre>

<p>though I would wrap that in a scope. You could probably also get away with excluding the <code>bookmarkable_type: "Coach"</code> condition since the join will enforce that.</p>
    </div>

<p>I did something like this (in C++), and it would be more easy if you order the board cards by their index, internally. So, if the board is Ax Kx Tx Jx Qx then, if you operate on the "behind" vector of cards [ordered by index, as in TJQKA] you can "see" more easily that this is a straight (the difference between the "behind" vector's indexes is one and the last one is an Ace ==&gt; this is a straight); it is also MUCH more easy to "compute" the 1,2 pairs, 3,4 of a kind...

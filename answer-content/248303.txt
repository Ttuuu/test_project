<p>I have posted this solution and I got 76 ms, faster than 98% on my first submission.
But consider this, to check the timer of LeetCode I tried more submissions (with the same exact code) and obtain very different results: 124, 156, 164, 120, 88 ms.
While the memory stays always consistent the runtime may vary quite a bit!</p>
<pre><code>    i = 0
    for j in range(1, len(nums)):
        if (nums[i] != nums[j]):
            i += 1
            nums[i] = nums[j]
    i +=1
    return i
</code></pre>

<p>The code was clear and readable. Good job.</p>

<p><strong>Bug?</strong></p>

<p>That said, there appears to be a bug in the "play again" logic:</p>

<pre><code>    if again == 'y' or again == 'Y':
        goblin_alive = True
    elif again == 'N' or again == 'n':
        print("\nGoodbye")
        exit()
</code></pre>

<p>It seems like you mark the goblin as alive, but don't give it any health. So the next game the goblin will start out ... dead?</p>

<p><strong>More Functions!</strong></p>

<p>I suggest that you write some more functions. There are places in your code where you are "repeating yourself", and this violates the <em>DRY principle</em> (don't repeat yourself)!</p>

<p>Specifically, there is this code in the "goblin health" section:</p>

<pre><code>    again = input("Play again? Y/N: ")

    if again == 'y' or again == 'Y':
        goblin_alive = True
    elif again == 'N' or again == 'n':
        print("\nGoodbye")
        exit()
</code></pre>

<p>There is similar code (but better) in the "player health" section. I'd suggest that you write a function called <code>play_again()</code> that asks the question and evaluates the response and returns either True or False. </p>

<p>Then you can write another function, <code>reset_game()</code> that resets the global variables for you (you'll want to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-global-statement" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>global</code></a> keyword for this).</p>

<p>You can then write code like:</p>

<pre><code>if play_again():
    reset_game()
else:
    exit()
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Magic Numbers</strong></p>

<p>Finally, I encourage you to define a pair of <em>constants</em> to use in place of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><em>magic numbers</em></a> 1 and 2:</p>

<pre><code># Near the top of the module
PLAYER_HITS = 1
GOBLIN_HITS = 2

    # Later in the code:
    if hit_type == PLAYER_HITS:
        damage = random.randint(1, 3)
        print("You deal a fierce blow for " + str(damage) + " damage to the goblin.")
        g_health = g_health - damage
    elif hit_type == GOBLIN_HITS:

<p>When reading this function alone, without any surrounding code, I wonder where the initial <code>+ 1</code> for the <code>position</code> comes from. That looks like an off-by-one bug to me. I don't know whether it is indeed a bug, it's just suspicious.</p>
<p>The calls to <code>tuple()</code> look redundant since the <code>current_position</code> already is a tuple. Doesn't your IDE warn about such things?</p>
<p>The word <code>position</code> is a bad name since it is ambiguous. It could either mean an <code>(x, y)</code> tuple or the complete <code>(board, player_to_move)</code> tuple, like in the sentence "in this position, Red should resign". A better name would be <code>last_move</code> or <code>prev_move</code>.</p>
<p>Is there a good reason why you use a tuple at all? Having two variables <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> would make the code pretty clear. These variable names are short enough that you don't need the <code>low_x</code> and related variables anymore.</p>
<p>Do you need the call to <code>tolist()</code> at all?</p>
<p>Instead of generating a 2-dimensional matrix, it could be more efficient if you just took the 6 neighbor regions explicitly and individually. That way you also get rid of the <code>pop(0)</code>. I don't know whether that is faster in Python though.</p>

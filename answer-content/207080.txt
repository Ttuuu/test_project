<p>Don't declare multiple variables on a single line. it is error prone and more difficult to read.</p>

<pre><code>int n,q,k,count;
</code></pre>

<p>should be:</p>

<pre><code>int n;
int q;
int k;
int count;
</code></pre>

<p>Not sure what I mean by error prone?</p>

<pre><code>int* n,q,k,count;
</code></pre>

<p>How many pointers do you have? one. only <code>n</code> would be a pointer in this declaration.</p>

<hr>

<p>Let your operators breathe. The lack of whitespace makes your code harder to read.</p>

<pre><code>for(int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
  {
    int temp;
    cin &gt;&gt; temp;
    s[i] = temp;
  }
</code></pre>

<p>this is a little easier to distinguish.</p>

<p>Use more consistent indentation. I had to read the code three times just to realize that the scope braces didn't line up with each other. I almost flagged to close because</p>

<pre><code>for ()
{
}
else
{}
</code></pre>

<p>would be broken, and that's how your braces line up horizontally.</p>

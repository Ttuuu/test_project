<p>Well, this is embarrassing. Turns out, that the lists weren't empty after all, but they had 1 item, with its date property (having the attribute <code>IsTimeWindowDate</code>) preceding the <code>dateFrom</code>. The result of <code>CalculateTimeWindows</code> would still be an empty list, and at the end I was only counting the rows inserted in the database (taking for example <code>myList1.Where(x =&gt; x.Date &gt;= dateFrom)</code>).</p>

<p>Still, this is taking a wee bit too much for 1 row.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> An improvement with this code whilst debugging locally, but actually taking longer when deployed live on Azure:</p>

<p>(first setting <code>lastWindow = false;</code> inside the <code>CalculateTimeWindows</code>)</p>

<pre><code>                    ...
                    if (itemPointer == stateModels.Count())
                        lastWindow = true;
                    else if (lastWindow)
                        break;
                }
                while (nextWindowFrom &lt;= dateTo);
</code></pre>

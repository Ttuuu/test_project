<p>Since you asked, I wouldn't think there would be any difference between using <code>else</code> vs <code>||</code>.</p>

<p>But, related to that, and to add on to the other answers, is that code should normally be written for humans first, and only incidentally for computers.</p>

<p>It takes only a bit of mental effort to reason that <code>(n % 2 != 0) || (n &gt;= 6 &amp;&amp; n &lt;= 20)</code> fulfils the four bullet points given, but it's even easier to mentally verify that this code does, because it exactly mirrors the problem statement:</p>

<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>public static boolean isWierd(int n) {

    if (n % 2 == 1) {
        return true;
    }

    if (2 &lt;= n &amp;&amp; n &lt;= 5) {
        return false;
    }

    if (6 &lt;= n &amp;&amp; n &lt;= 20) {
        return true;
    }

    return false;

}
</code></pre>

<p>When somebody is hunting through thousands of lines to find where a bug enters the system, it might be that they're having to keep in their minds the state of a number of variables and the call stack, potentially for several different execution paths. It should be as simple as possible for them to look at the <code>isWierd</code> function, convince themselves that it is correct, and move on.</p>

<p>And as with the other answers, the performance difference at this scale is likely to be either optimized away or be too small to matter (you can always come back to this if it does end up mattering). </p>

<p>Your custom function is 36 lines of very hard to digest code.  You are performing a battery of <code>if-elseif-else</code> conditionals on the same variable -- for this reason, it is most appropriate to employ a switch case (even though I have a strong bias against them) as a matter of best practice.  If the goal is to obfuscate the output AND the code, I reckon you've found a winner.</p>

<hr>

<p>I'll offer a comparison using tests <code>5</code>, <code>11</code>, and <code>987654321</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://jsfiddle.net/d2eqnLo3/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Test Results</a>:</p>

<pre><code>5 -&gt; [!+[] + !+[] + !+[] + !+[] + !+[]]
11 -&gt; +!+[] + [+!+[]]
987654321 -&gt; [+!+[] + [+[]] - !+[]] + [+!+[] + [+[]] - !+[] - !+[]] + [+!+[] + [+[]] - !+[] - !+[] - !+[]] + [+!+[] + [+[]] - !+[] - !+[] - !+[] - !+[]] + [!+[] + !+[] + !+[] + !+[] + !+[]] + [!+[] + !+[] + !+[] + !+[]] + [!+[] + !+[] + !+[]] + [!+[] + !+[]] + [+!+[]]

<p>Alternatively, you might leverage <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowBase64/Base64_encoding_and_decoding" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Javascript-native calls</a> to base64 encode: <code>btoa()</code> and <code>atob()</code>.  Because you are dealing purely with integers, you don't need to concern yourself with "The Unicode Problem".
To encode a number use <code>btoa(num)</code> and to decode it back use <code>atob(num)</code>.</p>

<p>Benefits include:</p>

<ol>
<li>Future developers of your code will be able to instantly research what your process is doing.</li>
<li>There is no need to write a custom function</li>
<li>The output is far, far better compressed</li>
<li>The process of decrypting the generated string is just as simple as encrypting it</li>
<li>If you want to further obfuscate the generated strings, you can cleanly add your own "special sauce" that will offer more "entertainment" for crackers.</li>
</ol>

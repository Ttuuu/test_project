<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>Other answers cover a lot but I also would suggest replacing </p>

<pre><code>while(deque.empty()) {
    condition.wait(lock); // unlocks, sleeps and relocks when woken up  
}
</code></pre>

<p>with</p>

<pre><code>condition.wait(lock, [this]{return !deque.empty();});
</code></pre>

<p>because it means the same and is more compact (readability being the same or also better).</p>
    </div>

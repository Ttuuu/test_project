<p>This is not a proper review, but rather an extended comment.</p>

<p>Are there shorter, more-concise alternatives to the above approach</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. You should view it not as a programming problem, but as a recreational math exercise.</p>
<p>Consider a simplest case of <code>N</code> being an even power of <code>10</code>, say <code>1000000</code>. For a moment, allow leading zeroes. Now, each 6-digit palindromic number <code>abccba</code> corresponds to a 3-digit number <code>abc</code>, and in fact is <code>1000*abc + cba</code>. Notice that if the sum of all 3-digit numbers is <code>X</code>, the sum of all 6-digit palindromic numbers is <code>1000*X + X = 1001*X</code>. As for <code>X</code>, recall the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression <code>0 + 1 + 2 + ... + 999</code>.</p>
<p>To deal with leading zeroes you must subtract the sum of those palindromic numbers which do have leading zeroes. Yet again, they are in form <code>abba0 = 1000*ab + 10*ba</code>. Yet again, use the arithmetic progression formula to get the result.</p>
<p>No programming beyond a few arithmetic operations is required.</p>
<p>I don't want to spell out the complete solution. I hope this is enough to get you started with the arbitrary N.</p>

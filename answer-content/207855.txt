<li>If you're going to drop in a comment block for function documentation, fill it out. Otherwise, delete it.</li>
<li>Generally you shouldn't <code>import</code> on the inside of a function. <code>import</code> at the top of a file.</li>
<li>Your constructed URL shouldn't use a series of <code>+</code>. You should be using the <code>%</code> formatting operator or <code>str.format()</code>. This will also avoid calling <code>str(0)</code>.</li>
<li>None of your <code>else</code>s are necessary. You return before each of them, so you can simply continue writing the rest of the function afterward.</li>
<li>If I were you, I would simply return <code>s_details['data']</code>. Decomposing the payload into a series of lists isn't really useful, and if it is indeed useful for your application, it should be done in a separate function.</li>
<li>Returning an error string to indicate an error is a bad idea. You should <code>raise</code> an exception instead.</li>
</ul>

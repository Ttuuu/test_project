<p>Let's make it pure function:</p>

<pre><code>function readLine() {
    return inputString[currentLine++];
}
</code></pre>

<p>IMHO both <code>for</code> loop should be transform to <code>reduce</code>, or at least the second one where you use only addition, it would be still simple and readable as a <code>reduce()</code>.</p>

<p>Personally, I don't like those shorts like <code>ws</code> - sounds like websocket, <code>ar</code> and means nothing, <code>obj</code> and <code>count</code> are too generic.</p>

<p><code>result</code> could be declared as <code>const</code>, as well <code>obj</code> and <code>count</code>.</p>

<p>And lastly, too much links as comments, why do you assume reviewer don't know TS, JS... or google? :)
Not to mention, the links could be dead soon.</p>

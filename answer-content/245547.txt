<p>@mickmackusa is correct, you should <strong>never ever use num_rows</strong> to count the rows in the database, it could kill your database server. This function is rather useless for any other use case too.</p>
<p>Besides, always follow the rule of thumb: make a database to do the job. If you need tell a database to give you the count.</p>
<p>As a code improvement, let me suggest you a <a href="https://phpdelusions.net/mysqli/simple" rel="nofollow noreferrer">mysqli helper function</a> I wrote to put all the prepare/bind/execute business under the hood</p>
<pre><code>public function getUnreadNumber()
{
    $userLoggedIn = $this-&gt;user_obj-&gt;getUsername();
    $sql = "SELECT COUNT(1) FROM notifications WHERE viewed='0' AND user_to = ?";
    return prepared_query($this-&gt;con, $sql, $userLoggedIn)-&gt;get_result()-&gt;fetch_row()[0];
}
</code></pre>
    </div>

<p>First, please note that <strong>this security measure has been <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/q/6095/1220">thoroughly</a> <a href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2016/08/18/nists-new-password-rules-what-you-need-to-know/" rel="noreferrer">debunked</a></strong> (although the reasons why are complex and psychological). Any code resulting from this exercise is therefore by the standards of the security community following an anti-pattern, and should not be used no matter how polished.</p>

<p>That said:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Rather than the</p>

<pre><code>if something:
    return True
return False
</code></pre>

<p>a more readable pattern is simply <code>return something</code>.</p></li>
<li>This code would be more scriptable if it either took passwords as arguments (using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>argparse</code></a>) or read one password per line from standard input.</li>
<li><p>Another way to make this more scriptable is to use the really common</p>

<pre><code>if __name__ == "__main__":
    sys.exit(main())
</code></pre>

<p>pattern.</p></li>
</ul>

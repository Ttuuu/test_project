<p>This is dangerous  </p>

<pre><code>int newId = bankAccounts.Count();
</code></pre>

<p>Cannot assume that will be a valid newID.  If this is a server application two clients could get the same newID before adding.  An account can be removed.</p>

<p>Account should overide equals and Accounts should be a HashSet.</p>

<p>There is no facility for knowing what accounts belong to an individual.  </p>

<p>There is no check of a person is allowed to withdraw from an account.</p>

<p>External should not be able to set balance.</p>

<pre><code>public decimal balance { get; set; }
</code></pre>

<p>The balance could be changed and no transaction. No withdrawal. </p>

<p>Maybe they are not looking for that stuff.  If the job was at a bank you have shown poor domain knowledge.</p>

<p>Name should be a property </p>

<pre><code>public class Bank
{
    public string Name { get; }

    private List&lt;Account&gt; bankAccounts = new List&lt;Account&gt;();
    public Bank(string name)
    {
        Name = name;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Transactions does not need a set.</p>

<pre><code>public List&lt;Transaction&gt; transactions { get; } = new List&lt;Transaction&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>Even with just a <code>get;</code> transactions can be modified externally.  It should probably be read only.</p>

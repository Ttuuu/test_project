<p>Your current battery of if conditions needs a re-think.  <code>$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']</code> -- as long as it has a non-falsey value will evauate to <code>true</code>, satisfy the first expression, will never even reach <code>$_SERVER['PHP_URL_PATH']  === "/mainHubV8.1.php"</code>, execute <code>echo "Loading Styles for MainHubV8.1.php";</code>, and nothing else will ever get a look.</p>

<p>It is unclear to me if you ever want to load multiple stylesheets.  If so this would a second reason to opt for a <code>switch</code> block versus an <code>if-elseif...</code> block.</p>

<p>You probably intend to check if the string is found in <code>$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']</code> or <code>$_SERVER['PHP_URL_PATH']</code>. Each variable must be separately checked (there are different techniques to perform that process).</p>

<p>I think you should choose one reliable source to make your comparison on.</p>

<p>To streamline your code without abandoning secure practices, I recommend a "whitelist" array of valid css filenames.  If the incoming value exists in the whitelist, include the css file(s) by directly writing the <code>$_SERVER</code> value into the echo line(s).</p>

<p>If you cannot manage to get the 1-to-1 literal variable string to match your css file, then I recommend a lookup array instead of a switch block (because I hate how verbose all those <code>break</code> lines make the script).</p>

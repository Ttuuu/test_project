<p>An observation on your class constructors.  At the moment you are using public properties to allow you to set the value of properties of a class after it has been created.  You can take this to the next step which allows you to delete the setters for the public class members by passing the create parameters to the Self function.</p>

<p>In this way you can create objects with immutable properties from  parameters that are provided at the time of object creation.</p>

<pre><code>Public Function Create(ByVal Logger As ILogger, ByVal MessageSender As IMessageSender) As Chore

    With New Chore

        Set Create = .Self(Logger, MessageSender)

    End With

End Function


Public Function Self(ByVal Logger As ILogger, ByVal MessageSender As IMessageSender) As Chore
' This code runs internal to the newly created instance
        Set this.Logger = Logger
        Set this.MessageSender = MessageSender
        Set Self = Me

    End Property
</code></pre>

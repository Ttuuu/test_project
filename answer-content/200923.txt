<p>That's the correct approach, and so I don't think time or space complexity can be improved significantly.  </p>

<p>However, you could improve the re-usability of the function by using an array to store the counts, rather than individual variables.</p>

<pre><code>private static void printSortedArray (int[] array, int maxElement) {
    int[] counts = new int[maxElement + 1];

    for (Integer element : array) {
        // You could check if 0 &lt;= element &lt; maxElement here
        counts[element]++;            
    }

    for(int i = 0; i &lt; counts.length; i++) {
        for(; counts[i] &gt; 0; counts[i]--) {
            System.out.print(i + " ");
        }
    }

    System.out.println();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also, as changed above, there's no point to slightly abbreviating your variable and function names.  The additional clarity is worth being two letters longer.</p>

<p>Additionally, a function like this would more typically either re-arrange the array in place, or return a separate sorted array, rather than sticking sorting and printing together.  For this program it does what it needs to, but generally speaking it's good to separate your logic from your output.</p>

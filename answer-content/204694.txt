<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>Assuming you want a SOLID code and keep the single responsibility principle, you would need to inject window and document separately.
A clean way is to provide each of them using the <code>useValue</code> property of your provider:</p>

<pre><code>@NgModule({
  declarations: [...],
  imports: [...],
  providers: [
   { provide: "windowObject", useValue: window}
  ]
})
</code></pre>

<p>as already <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/40222547/532695">answered on SO</a>:
same stuff for the document provider.</p>
    </div>

<h1>General thoughts</h1>

<p>The script looks decent. I like how most lines have sufficient spacing that lends itself to readability and there are ample comments throughout the code. </p>

<p>It is good that the script exits early when it cannot connect to the database or cannot open a file for writing. Initially I thought about suggesting that <code>file_put_contents()</code> be used instead of <code>fopen()</code>, <code>fwrite()</code> and <code>fclose()</code> but that would require dramatic changes to the structure of the script and might lead to queries being run before the file paths could be checked.</p>

<h1>Suggestions</h1>

<h2>Constants</h2>

<p>While it appears you intend to have users of this script modify them, <code>$useroutfile</code> and <code>$grantoutfile</code> could be declared as constants, since the value is never re-assigned. The same would also apply to the values stored in variables for the database connection info (e.g. <code>$dbuser</code>, <code>$dbpassword</code>).</p>

<p>Another thing to consider for those values is to get them from command line arguments or else user input.</p>

<h2>Database Server name hard-coded</h2>

<p>The value for <code>$dsn</code> contains <code>localhost</code> for the host name:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>$dsn = 'mysql:host=localhost;charset=utf8mb4';
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Some users might need to modify a database server other than <em>localhost</em>. It may be wise to support a different host name with a variable/constant that can be configured at the top of the script.</p>

<h2>Unused variable <code>$notuser</code></h2>

<p>This variable doesn't appear to be used after it is assigned:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>$notuser = implode(',',array_map('add_quotes',$ignore_users));
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>I presume you intended to use that in the <code>WHERE</code> condition inside the string assigned to <code>$Query</code>.</p>

<h2>Use consistent variable naming patterns</h2>

<p>I see most variables are in all lowercase, but there are a couple outliers:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>$ignore_users</code></li>
<li><code>$Query</code></li>
</ul>

<p>It is best to stick to a common convention for naming variables.</p>

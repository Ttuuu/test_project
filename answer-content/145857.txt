<p>You usage of the mixin will work and although it is not pretty there is not much else that can be done as far as valid LESS / CSS output.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that this using a JavaScript array in a hacky type mannor and the output would still need to be sanitized of the extrenious code that is not valid. But I think we are both headed in the same direction.</p>

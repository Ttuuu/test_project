<p>I'm glad you did this, gives me a chance to further enforce/correct some misinformation.</p>

<p><code>final double pi = Math.PI;</code> this is a circumstance where the value pi should be <em>static</em> and would appropriately be written as UPPERCASE <code>PI</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Static since the value of pi is not dependent on any instance of Circle</li>
<li>Final, since of course you wouldn't want anything changing it</li>
<li>Uppercase since it is both these things, it is considered <strong>constant</strong> thus the naming convention.</li>
</ul>

<p>Though, there's no need for you to take up namespace or memory when you can <em>directly use</em> <code>Math.PI</code>. For instance, your <code>double area()</code> method's implementation could be:</p>

<p><code>return Math.PI * Math.pow(radius, 2);</code></p>

<p>For the same reason instead of having placeholder variables that aren't used elsewhere:</p>

<pre><code>double a = 5, b = 3, c = 4;
Shape triangle = new Triangle(a,b,c);
</code></pre>

<p>Simply use them</p>

<pre><code>Shape triangle = new Triangle(5, 3, 4);
</code></pre>

<p>a, b, and c aren't really fitting names to begin with, if you do elect to use them try using more descriptive names such as base, side1, and side2 in this case.</p>

<p>I like that you use the abstract class to declare in your tests, doing that will afford you some flexibility in the future, just make sure you understand that when you rely on specific methods that only exist in a subclass you'd have to declare with that subclass.</p>

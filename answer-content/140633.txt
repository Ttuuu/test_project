<p>The Fibonacci sequence grows fast enough that it exceeds 4 000 000 with its 34th term, as shown on the <a href="https://oeis.org/A000045" rel="nofollow">OEIS</a>.</p>

<p>Given this fact, hardcoding the set of even Fibonacci numbers under 4 000 000 - or even their sum - would be far from impractical and would be an obvious solution to drastically increase execution time.</p>

<p>You want a data structure that supports efficiently manipulating head and tail. Usually we call that a <a href="http://www.collectionsjs.com/deque" rel="nofollow noreferrer">deque</a>, a double-ended queue, sometimes implemented with linked lists.</p>

<p>As I look at your diagram, the containers on top and bottom in some sense hold the same R,B,Y sequence of items, just in cyclic permutation. So why don't you consider using a simple array of size N, with <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code> indices that you increment mod N ? Then you only incur expensive memory copies when an effect finally completes.</p>

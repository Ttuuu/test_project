  <p>The stopwatch i kept for checking time taken to load DataGrid. It is
  showing value less than 250ms. But in reality it is taking too much
  take show and for 4-6 second the UI gets hanged. Why is hanging? How
  to overcome it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's beacuse the datagrid layout update is happening asynchronously. You can work around it by exploiting the dispatcher priority system:</p>

<pre><code>Dispatcher.CurrentDispatcher.BeginInvoke(
                ((Action)(() =&gt;
                {
                    sw.Stop(); //We stop it here, after the datagrid has been rendered
                    btnClick.Content = sw.ElapsedMilliseconds.ToString();
                })),
                DispatcherPriority.Loaded);
</code></pre>

<p>The Loaded priority is just below the Render priority, so that code will be executed after the datagrid has been rendered.</p>

  <p>How can i show BusyIndicator till DataGrid is fully created?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Use a task to load the data table:</p>

<pre><code>ctrlBusy.IsBusy = true;
var task = Task.Factory.StartNew&lt;DataTable&gt;(() =&gt; dbLayer.tblSaddleSelectAll());
task.ContinueWith(
                t =&gt; dgvMap.ItemsSource = t.Result.DefaultView, 
                CancellationToken.None, 
                Tasks.TaskContinuationOptions.OnlyOnRanToCompletion, 
                TaskScheduler.FromCurrentSynchronizationContext());

task.ContinueWith(
                t =&gt; ctrlBusy.IsBusy = false, 
                CancellationToken.None, 
                Tasks.TaskContinuationOptions.None, 
                TaskScheduler.FromCurrentSynchronizationContext());
</code></pre>

<p>I'm sorry i can't help with the other questions.</p>

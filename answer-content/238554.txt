<p>In your first code you already have everything you need, you just don't use it. <code>List2</code> and <code>List3</code> are each lists of points to create. But they only contain one point, so your <code>for</code> loop does nothing exciting, it only runs once.</p>

<p>You can simply add more points to any of the lists, here I take the first as an example:</p>

<pre><code>import simplekml

points = [['Placemark', 'old file', 51.500152, -0.126236],
          ['New placemark', 'new file', 51.600152, -0.136236]] # description, lat, lon

kml = simplekml.Kml()
for point in points:
    kml.newpoint(name=point[0], description=point[1],
                 coords=[(point[3], point[2])])  # lon, lat, optional height

kml.save("test2.kml")
</code></pre>

<p>You could make this a bit more readable by using a <code>collections.namedtuple</code> for the markers. This way your comments become superfluous:</p>

<pre><code>from collections import namedtuple
import simplekml

Marker = namedtuple("Marker", ["name", "description", "lat", "lon"])

points = [Marker('Placemark', 'old file', 51.500152, -0.126236),
          Marker('New placemark', 'new file', 51.600152, -0.136236)]

kml = simplekml.Kml()
for point in points:
    kml.newpoint(name=point.name, description=point.description,
                 coords=[(point.lon, point.lat)])

kml.save("test2.kml")
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I followed Python's official style-guide, <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP8</a>, when naming my variables. Variables and functions should be <code>lower_case</code> and only classes (such as the namedtuple class I create) should be in <code>PascalCase</code>. PEP8 also recommends putting a space after commas and not to use unnecessary whitespace. </p>

<p>Just to add on to the C++ answer.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You're assuming that a solution exists, due to lack of break condition in the loop. That may work for Leetcode; however, that is not a reasonable assumption. If a solution doesn't exist, you're in Undefined Behavior Land by accessing the array out of bounds.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You don't need <code>return vector&lt;int&gt;{index, iter-second};</code>. Just <code>return {index, iter-&gt;second};</code> works due to implicit construction of vector from an initializer list.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Assuming it's possible that a solution doesn't exist, you might want to return an empty vector or a <code>std::optional</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>This post has been around for too long and I don't want it to be <a href="https://codereview.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1511/120114">a zombie</a> any longer... You haven't replied to our questions in comments but we see you have been on SE sites lately so I am going to go ahead with the code as is.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/143034/displaying-a-conflict-marker#comment268222_143034">was pointed out in comments</a> there appears to be some type of rendering (perhaps server-side) that is mixed in with the JavaScript code, which is not declared, so I wouldn't really be able to try running the code even if I wanted to :/ I could try to dig through your StackOverflow posts to find relevant code but I don't have time for that. </p>

<p>For the code you posted, it doesn't really seem like "<em>a lot</em>" but that depends on perspective... if you really wanted, you could abstract the code in the <code>v-if</code> (i.e. <code>v-if="date.datestamp==conflict.datestamp"</code>) to a method and call it instead of having the logic in the markup.</p>

<p>I question whether <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>&lt;template&gt;</code></a> is the best tag to use in the <code>for</code> loops...While there are no restrictions on permitted content within a <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> tag, it seems odd to have one nested inside the other. Would a simple <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> suffice for one or both?</p>

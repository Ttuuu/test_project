<p>A small side note: in <code>create()</code>, you wrote</p>

<pre><code>int openspots = 20;
// ...
while (openspots-- &gt; 0) {
// ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>While it looks clean, it's weird to read and should probably be written as a <code>for</code>-loop. This way, you also reduce the scope of <code>openspots</code> to inside the loop and don't clutter up your namespace inside of <code>create()</code>. Also, the twenty seems a bit like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_%28programming%29" rel="nofollow noreferrer">magic number</a> to me, you shold probably put it into a constant. This would make the loop look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>for (int openspots = CONST - 1; openspots &gt;= 0; openspots--) {
// ...
}
</code></pre>
    </div>

<p>I think your code has an issue:</p>

<pre><code>this.checkFilterValue(element.children || this.filtersConfig[index + 1], currentFilterName)
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>this.filtersConfig[index + 1]</code> is never called as you check <code>element.children</code> first:</p>

<pre><code>if (element.children) {
   ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Your code doesn't need a <code>forEach</code> as a for loop will be better:</p>

<pre><code>checkFilterValue(group, currentFilterName) {
  for (let key in group) {
    const { name, value, children } = group[key]
    if (name === currentFilterName) {
      return value
    }

    if (children) {
        let found = this.checkFilterValue(children, currentFilterName)
        if (found) return found
    }
  }

  return null
}
</code></pre>

<p>By using a for loop you are able to directly return the value if found.</p>

<p>Another issue of your code is you missed to reset <code>this.returnedValue</code> doing so you have a bug if you call 2 different searches and the second one doesn't find anything.</p>

<p>Although you didn't share other code, maybe you should do this in another method.</p>

<p>You can see I use the spread operator to make the code much more concise:</p>

<pre><code>const { name, value, children } = group[key]
</code></pre>

<p>and get rid of <code>element.something</code>.</p>

<p>Not sure how to handle the part where you call the function with a different set of data, but maybe inside this method is not the right place of doing it.</p>

<p>Here are a few thoughts, in no particular order:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Separation of concerns</strong>: Better separate display/styling/HTML issues from the high-level application code (the questions posed and the responses provided). </li>
<li><strong>Object-oriented approach</strong>: Consider for example constructors; Survey(), Section(), Slide(), Radio_group(), Radio_button().</li>
<li><strong>Question types</strong>: The survey is currently limited to a hard-coded "VERY DISSATISFIED" ... "VERY SATISFIED" scale. Other semantic scales could be offered, as could "Yes/No" booleans.</li>
<li><strong>Branching</strong>: It's not atypical for surveys to branch - ie to be responsive to the answers provided. Branching would probably require a change of approach, by which slides are built on-the-fly rather than building everything at the start.</li>
<li><strong>Colors</strong>: As it stands colors are limited to those specified in the CSS style sheet. You might consider a more flexible, data-driven approach, implemented wholly in javascript.</li>
<li><strong>Summarizing results</strong>: There are issues around the <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-summarize-Likert-Scale-Questionnaire-results" rel="nofollow noreferrer">summarization of Likert scale questionnaire results</a> that you need to be aware of. I'm sure the web includes many other good articles/discussions on the subject.</li>
</ol>

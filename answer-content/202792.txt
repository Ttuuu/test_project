<p>Welcome to the world of programming! Congrats on undertaking your first project as well! I will have to spend more time looking at your code to figure out how to do things more efficiently, but in terms of adding functionality to prevent a user from entering duplicate coordinates I think you can expand your <code>checkOutOfBounds()</code> function. </p>

<p>I think you can rename that function to be <code>checkIfValidInput()</code>. This function will not only check the out of bounds condition but also check to see if a set of coordinates has already been entered. Are you familiar with <a href="https://www.callicoder.com/java-arraylist/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>ArrayList</code></a>? This would be a good opportunity to use one to keep track of the coordinates entered by the user. You can either use an array list (preferable because the size can dynamically increase) or an array of 2-element arrays , i.e. an array of each user coordinate choice during the game. When the user enters a set of coordinates inside of your <code>userCoordsChoice()</code>, you store that coordinate and when you call the <code>checkIfValidInput()</code> you can check this array to see if those coordinates have already have been called.</p>

<p>I think my approach to this problem would be to separate it into two completely independent classes.</p>

<p>The first class would take a <code>List&lt;String&gt;</code> and modify that collection to conform to your length constraint. The result of this transformation could be a new, potentially shorter, <code>List&lt;String&gt;</code>, perhaps with a "..." as the last element where required. Or it could be an object that encapsulates an <code>int</code> for the number of entries to keep and a <code>boolean</code> for whether truncation was necessary.</p>

<p>The second class would then create the comma-separated list. The implementation of this will depend on how you implemented the first class. Don't forget that if you're using Java 8 then you can use the following quite delightful snippet of code to turn a <code>List&lt;String&gt;</code> into a comma-separated <code>String</code>:</p>

<pre><code>list.stream().collect(Collectors.joining(","))
</code></pre>

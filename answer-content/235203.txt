<p>GetFileBatches is enumerating fileInfoCollection twice.  One for Any and once for groupby.  </p>

<p>By default Rx runs same thread.  You could test this by logging Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId and seeing the values. The RawDepthMapsProducer isn't adding anything and just adding over head since its all on the same thread.   You can read more <a href="http://introtorx.com/Content/v1.0.10621.0/15_SchedulingAndThreading.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.  Right now it's just the code inside the Parallel.ForEach that is using different threads, but the Observable inside are using the same thread.</p>

<p>Rx running by default on the same thread is why the Task.Run needed to be there to get it off the main thread.  ObserveOn would be a more Rx option or using SelectMany for Tasks. </p>

<p>Hard to give more feedback with this so much abstracted and if you can use Task or not.  You could switch to the ObserveOn to use ThreadPool but this might cause too much back pressure.   </p>

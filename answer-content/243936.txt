<p>I consider that the second option is better for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first option is more verbose than the second, and it is in a way that there is no additional information which allow other developers or even you to obtain meaningful information.</li>
<li>The second option has a constant style name which represents what you are trying to tell us, "hey, this is a constant and its value is ..." and so, it clearly reflects a shorter and descriptive code style.</li>
<li>Having less properties (in your objects) implies less space, and less space computed implies less execution time. (even if it is very small).</li>
<li>Less content helps you to debug faster.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, I hope it helped you.</p>

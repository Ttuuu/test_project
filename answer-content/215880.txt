  <p>efficient solution to a Google interview question where they ask you to either find the lowest or second lowest value in an array without using the max or min methods.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the question is to find the lowest or second lowest value, then sorting (log-linear) will be <em>very</em> inefficient compared to making one or two passes (linear) to find the two numbers.</p>

<p>The generalized version of the task to find the <code>k</code>-th lowest number,
is not a small detail and not to be underestimated.
Sorting the entire array is still going to be quite inefficient.
Consider an alternative approach, using a max-heap:</p>

<ul>
<li>If <code>k</code> is larger than the number of elements, then raise an exception or return <code>undefined</code>.</li>
<li>Add the first <code>k</code> elements to a max-heap.</li>
<li>For each remaining element:

<ul>
<li>If the value is equal or greater than the top of the heap, ignore it</li>
<li>Otherwise add the value to the heap, and remove the top</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>In the end, the top of the heap is the <code>k</code>-the lowest value.</p>

<p>I realize this is just puzzle code, but treating this as a merge request for a production system:</p>

<ol>
<li>Replacing unknown codes with a space character seems counter to requirements. I would instead just <code>t.append(codes[s])</code> and let the script exit with an error when given invalid input. If I wanted a more user friendly error message I'd catch this specific error and either print a warning on standard error before continuing or throw an application-specific error.</li>
<li>You would also want to read from standard input rather than a specific file. That way you could use your script as part of a pipeline.</li>
<li>Translation should be separate from reading input. That way the translation code can be reused independently of the input method.</li>
<li>If you may have huge input I would use buffered reads rather than line-based. The former doesn't have to inspect every character, and the user can't kill the program by passing in a single long line.</li>
<li>The mapping from a string of three spaces to a single space should be in <code>codes</code>. That way you're operating exactly to spec rather than second guessing what other sequences of spaces mean, and it gets rid of a costly regex replacement.</li>
</ol>

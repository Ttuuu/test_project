<p>Nope, it is not correct. The problem is that the to_visit list can change after visiting a child of the currect node(for example, on a full graph with 3 vertices your implementation will visit the third node twice(if you run the depth-first search from the first vertex)). However, it is easy to fix it. You can just iterate over all children of the current node and run a depth-first from a child if it has not been visited yet(using an if statement inside the for loop).</p>

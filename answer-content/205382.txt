<p>The <code>UpdateNames</code> event should be <code>TeamChanged</code> or something, so that it tells the presenter what happened on the view, as opposed to what the presenter should be doing; "update names" sounds more like a method name than an event, too.</p>

<p>The presenter shouldn't know about any form controls: the view knows about the model - there's no need to round-trip to the presenter to update the list of names, IMO that's pure presentation logic that should remain encapsulated in the view.</p>

<p>The <code>IsValid</code> logic could be used to keep the OK button disabled until the model is in a valid state; that way you wouldn't need that <code>MsgBox</code>, as the user wouldn't even be able to attempt to submit incomplete/invalid data.</p>

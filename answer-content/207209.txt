<p>AFAIK, trigonometric functions are pretty much unavoidable in (non-graph-based) dynamic movement. Depending on what you're trying to accomplish, grid- or graph-based movement might be an option, though graph traversal and pathfinding can be its own can of worms.</p>

<p>A simpler solution might be to just precalculate the sine/cosine/arctangent of a few hundred values and store them in a <code>TypedArray</code> where you can look them up directly. Since you're not doing scientific calculations, this might very well be enough. You'll probably want to run some benchmarks to compare the two solutions, though.</p>

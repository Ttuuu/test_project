<p>Based on my first not too thorough read, this looks rather nice. I currently only have two points of critique.</p>

<p>The first point is the lack of explicit interfaces. I think both the <code>PlayerGrid</code> and the <code>Grid Coordinates</code>could use an explicit interface, <code>IGrid</code> and <code>IGridCoordimate</code> say. While it may be reasonable to invent different grids, it might look odd at first to have an interface for <code>IGridCoordinate</code>. However, with the interface you can hide away the <code>Create</code> member that really should not be used by consuming code. </p>

<p>The second point concerns the globals. First, I think the grid size and ship count should really be injected into the <code>PlayerGrid</code> instead of referring to global constants. At some point in the future you might want to make them a setting.
Second, I think the global functions really belong in an implementation of an <code>IShipFactory</code> or maybe <code>IShipyard</code> that can be injected into anything needing to generate new ships. </p>

<p>I wonder if you are asking the right question. I can't help but wonder where this code block could possibly run in order to make sense.</p>

<p>I will have to assume a lot, so here we go:</p>

<p>Why don't you create an associative array where the keys are the endpoint and the values are a string of your stylesheet.</p>

<p>This way you will be able to read that from a database one day.</p>

<p>Now take your endpoint (a note here: you want to look into <code>REQUEST_URI</code> and/or <code>parse_url</code>) and simply get your values out:</p>

<pre><code>$styleSheets =['index.php'=&gt;'style.css'];
$styleSheets[$currentRoute]
</code></pre>

<p>That said, feel free to share your code-base as I think you might want to get some feedback on your general structure.</p>

<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>Two things I noticed.</p>

<ol>
<li>The return statement if the length is invalid should be on a separate line, and wrapped in braces</li>
<li>What purpose does the int cast solve? I thought php was typeless.</li>
</ol>

<p>Other than that, the only other thing I noticed is to space out your operators. However, all the actual function seems to work fine </p>
    </div>

  <p>Please review for performance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The performance looks fine to me. Some key observations:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's clear that all nodes must be visited to compute the correct answer, so the solution cannot be better than <span class="math-container">\$O(n)\$</span> time.</li>
<li>Traversing in level order as you did will require as much additional space as the number of nodes on the most dense level.</li>
<li>Traversing depth first would require as much additional space as the longest path from root to leaf.</li>
</ul>

<p>Without knowing in advance the shape of the tree (whether it's deep or wide),
and given <code>TreeNode</code> as defined and no additional helper data structures,
it's not possible to tell whether DFS or BFS is better.
So they are both equally fine, as neither uses space excessively.</p>

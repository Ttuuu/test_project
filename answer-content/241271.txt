<p>I will give you some tips about defining structs that later are going to be part of a file, of course you can do in other way but this is the way I follow in general. I understand that the following struct is the header of the file.</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct {
    I2C_TypeDef *pI2Cx;
    I2C_Config_t I2C_Config;
    I2C_State I2C_State;
    uint8_t *txBuffer;
    uint8_t *pRxBuffer;
    uint8_t rxStartIndex;
    uint8_t rxBufferSize;
    uint8_t txBufferLength;
    uint8_t rxBufferLength;
} I2C_Handle_t;
</code></pre>

<p>In general header files contains some bytes for identification(check libmagic library), the second tip is to have all the types group to avoid misalignment of data. So your struct will be </p>

<pre><code>typedef struct {
    uint32_t magic; // The magic value
    I2C_Config_t I2C_Config;
    I2C_State I2C_State; 
    I2C_TypeDef *pI2Cx;
    uint8_t *txBuffer;
    uint8_t *pRxBuffer;
    uint8_t rxStartIndex;
    uint8_t rxBufferSize;
    uint8_t txBufferLength;
    uint8_t rxBufferLength;
} I2C_Handle_t;
</code></pre>

<p>Also you can use the attribute packed of the compiler if needed alignment of the data struct.</p>

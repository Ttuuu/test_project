<h1>Code Review</h1>
<p>Despite its name, <code>"stdafx.h"</code> isn't a standard header.  It doesn't seem to be needed, as the code compiles and runs without it.</p>
<p>Your indentation is off - perhaps that's a result of how you inserted the code into the question?</p>
<p>The <code>continue</code> is redundant - there's no more code within the loop after the <code>if</code>/<code>else</code>, so it can be omitted.</p>
<p>The code assumes that a result will be found before <code>int</code> overflows.  Remember that <code>INT_MAX</code> may be as small as 32767; perhaps <code>unsigned long</code> may be a better choice, or one of the fixed-width types specified in <code>&lt;cstdint&gt;</code>, perhaps?</p>
<p>Your loop structure would be clearer if you separate out the test from incrementing smallest multiple.  That could look something like this (still using <code>int</code> as our type):</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;climits&gt;

static bool is_multiple_of_all(int n, int max)
{
    for (int i = 10;  i &lt;= max;  ++i) {
        if (n % i != 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}


int main()
{
    const int target = 20;
    for (int candidate = 2 * target;
         candidate &lt;= INT_MAX - target;
         candidate += target)
    {
        if (is_multiple_of_all(candidate, target)) {
            std::cout &lt;&lt; candidate;
            return 0;
        }
    }
    // not found
    return 1;
}
</code></pre>
<h1>Algorithm</h1>
<p>Project Euler problems tend to exercise your mathematical reasoning.  You're expected to find better methods than brute force search to find the solution.  (Hint: think about prime factors).</p>

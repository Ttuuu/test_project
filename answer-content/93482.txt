<p>I am puzzled by the lack of parallelism.</p>

<ul>
<li>Your <code>changeClass()</code> would be more accurately called <code>addClasses()</code>.  However, the inverse operation is just an anonymous function for <code>$('#message').on(…)</code>.</li>
<li><code>$('#message').on(…)</code> uses jQuery, but nothing else does.</li>
<li><code>$('#message').on(…)</code> refers to <code>$(this).parent()</code> which presumably refers to the same element as <code>document.getElementById("dragNdrop")</code>. </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, you have one onClick handler and one onFocus handler. I don't know if you are intentionally listening for two different types of events.</p>

<p>Once you clean up all of these inconsistencies, the code should be a lot easier to understand.</p>

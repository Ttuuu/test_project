<p>Yes <code>logging</code> could replace <code>writeReport</code>, but it wouldn't write JSON. It would not be able to replace the other two functions.</p>

<p><em>But</em> <code>logging</code> is a complex library, and can be rather daunting to get it to work correctly as a beginner. And overall the majority of your code would still be the same. Given that you're mutating globals than I think you may be overwhelmed  when implementing it.</p>

<hr>

<p>However I have never needed a function like <code>error</code>, as if I raise an error it's either mission critical - exiting the program. Or it's for control flow. And so I believe the rest of your system is misconfigured, as you shouldn't need <code>error</code>.</p>

<p>Additionally both <code>error</code> and <code>state</code> should be passed the message as an argument. If you need to use existing error messages then you can put them in a module:</p>

<p><code>states.py</code></p>

<pre><code>CODE_0 = 'El programa funciono correctamente'
CODE_1  = 'Se accedio a la base de datos'
...
</code></pre>

<pre><code>import states

state(states.CODE_0)
</code></pre>

<p>Or just a list:</p>

<pre><code>STATES = [
    'El programa funciono correctamente'
]

state(STATES[0])
</code></pre>

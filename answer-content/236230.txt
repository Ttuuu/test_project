<p>It's a basic command pattern without any safety checks against programming errors. :) It would be a good idea to check that a word can not be removed from an empty list.</p>

<p>While the code shows that you know how to code a command pattern it doesn't tell me if you understand why one would want to use it. Having WriteCommand and UndoCommand objects going around in isolation makes very little sense. And domain-wise, writing to a text editor with command objects is probably not something that I would do.</p>

<p>Instead put the command pattern into actual use by, for example, integrating it to the editor in the form of an undo/redo stack. Appending strings to the editor automatically create undo commands into the stack and performing the undo command executes the last command and adds a corresponding redo command into the redo stack.</p>

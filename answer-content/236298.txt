<p>Some quick remarks:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A <code>List&lt;StringBuilder&gt;</code> seems a very bad return value, IMHO. Is there a reason for such an unusual type?</p></li>
<li><p><code>result</code> is a <code>List&lt;StringBuilder&gt;</code>, so it should be <code>results</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>What is returned in the case of <code>if ((result == null) || (!result.Any()))</code>? I'm guessing a <code>null</code>, so return that as fast as possible, that way the rest of the code doesn't need to be indented as much.</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of "\r\n", use <code>Environment.NewLine</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>This code is almost 40 lines long and yet it seems to be only a part of a longer section of code. This worries me, because it suggests that the method it is part of is much longer and even more convoluted. I'd urge you to split your code into smaller methods which each do one particular task.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>But my main objection is <code>List&lt;StringBuilder&gt;</code>, and that you use this list to do a <code>Contains()</code> on its contents (and then even assume some kind of order in the returned result when a condition about <code>result[0]</code> causes you to parse <code>result[1]</code>). Considering that you're searching for specific predefined phrases, suggests that the return of <code>ReadResult_WS_Import</code> should really be a custom class with meaningful properties.</p>

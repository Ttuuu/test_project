<p>So, you basically rewrote the <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strtok/" rel="noreferrer">strtok function</a> in ANSI C. The difference is that you allocate memory for each substring while TOK modifies the original string by adding \0 characters in the place of delimiters. This means that you keep allocating more and more memory, while you can just make a copy of the whole string and use strtok to modify the copy you just made, keeping the original string untouched.
When you write more advanced C code, try to avoid the need to allocate more memory. You know the amount of memory required is just the length of the string so make a copy of it. Then replace the tokens you want to replace with the \0 character, walking through the string just once and returning pointers to each start of a substring. And decide if "\0" is a string that you want to return or not...
Nice attempt, but it can be improved by not using realloc() in the first place... That method will slow down this function considerably...</p>

<p>Welcome to the community :). A few pointers:</p>
<ol>
<li>The code does not follow <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="noreferrer">PEP-8 style guide</a>. You should follow the <code>snake_case</code> naming convention for variables.</li>
<li>Split code into separate functions.</li>
<li>Instead of the code running as is, the execution condition should be placed inside an <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/419163/what-does-if-name-main-do"><code>if __name__</code></a> block.</li>
<li>If you're on python 3.6+, make use of f-strings over concatenating separate variables and casting them to strings over and over.</li>
<li>Cast the input from user as float as soon as it is read.</li>
<li>I don't think you need to round the random variable calculated to 4 digits. For print purpose, you can use the precision specifier.</li>
<li>Again, if using python 3.6+, you can also provide type hinting.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>The above mentioned points, and a few more changes, your code would be:</p>
<pre><code>from math import isclose
from random import randint


def calculate_sq_root(num: float) -&gt; float:
    "generate a random number and manipulate it until we calculate square root of input number"
    random_num = randint(1, 9)
    print(f"Random number is {random_num}.")
    while not isclose(num, random_num * random_num):
        random_num = (random_num ** 2 + num) / (random_num * 2)
        print(f"Trying number {random_num:.4f}")
    return random_num


def get_input() -&gt; float:
    "ask user for a number to find sq root for"
    return float(input("Please enter number for which we'll find sq root:\n"))


def main():
    user_num = get_input()
    sq_root = calculate_sq_root(user_num)
    print(f"Square root of {user_num} is {sq_root}.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
</code></pre>

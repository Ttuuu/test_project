<p>I'm appalled!  What kind of code are you writing that's so inflexible it needs all these tests?  ;-p</p>

<p>Seriously, it ought to be possible to enable only the tests that the including code needs, perhaps by predefining macros that declare its non-portabilities:</p>

<pre><code>#ifdef REQUIRE_BINARY_FP
static_assert(FLT_RADIX == 2, "Dinosuar: Non binary FP");
#endif
</code></pre>

<p>(to pick a simple example)</p>

<hr>

<p>On an extremely minor note, in the comments you've consistently written "insure" where you evidently mean "ensure".</p>

<hr>

<p>Additional tests to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>I've seen code that breaks if <code>'z' - 'a' != 25</code> and/or <code>'Z' - 'A' != 25</code>.</li>
<li>Some code requires the existence of exact-width integer types such as <code>uint32_t</code>, which are not available on all platforms (it's possible this is covered by the power-of-two byte-width test, but I can't prove it).</li>
<li>Perhaps some code requires <code>long double</code> to be bigger (in precision and/or range) than <code>double</code>?</li>
</ul>

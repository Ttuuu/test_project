<p>First, to fix your formula:</p>

<p><code>r</code> probably shouldn't be divided by 100, since the argument is <code>.045</code> in one of the examples, which I verified to mean 4.5% rather than 0.045%.</p>

<p>Now, the loop logic:</p>

<p>Your current code replaces <code>compInt</code> each time the for loop runs, so it does something like this.</p>

<p>Example: P=1000, r=0.045, t=3</p>

<pre><code>compInt = 0
compInt = 1000 * 1.045 ^ 0
compInt = 1000 * 1.045 ^ 1
compInt = 1000 * 1.045 ^ 2
compInt = 1000 * 1.045 ^ 3
</code></pre>

<p>There is no need to perform any of the calculations except for the last line. </p>

<p>However, since your teacher wants you to not use <code>Math.pow</code> and use a loop. So think: what gets repeated when you do <code>Math.pow</code>? Multiplication, of course. So you simply multiply the principal by <code>1+r</code> for each year. </p>

<p>Since it's homework, I'm not going to post the revised code, but I hope I've given you an idea of where to go.</p>

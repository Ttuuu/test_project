<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>We need to protect <code>a</code> when it's an expression - we've put parens around <code>a[0]</code> where we should have put them around <code>a</code>:</p>

<pre><code>(sizeof(a)/sizeof(a)[0])
</code></pre>

<p>For the same reason, I think that the second <code>typeof</code> should be</p>

<pre><code>typeof(&amp;(a)[0])
</code></pre>

<p>I have to admit that I can't easily contrive an expression of array type where the parens make a difference, but better safe than sorry...</p>

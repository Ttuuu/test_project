  <p>I want to include it as a practice of getting used to writing solutions that require classes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No solution "requires" classes, although some situations are better represented with classes than with other techniques.</p>

<p>In this particular case, <code>Shape</code> doesn't really need to exist - as you've already identified. Since each of those methods only depends on <code>term</code>, you can simply have three functions all accepting one integer.</p>

<p>Some other things that can improve:</p>

<h2>Int division</h2>

<p>This:</p>

<pre><code>return int(self.term * (self.term + 1) / 2)
</code></pre>

<p>can be</p>

<pre><code>return self.term * (self.term + 1) // 2
</code></pre>

<h2>Enumerate-to-<code>/dev/null</code></h2>

<p>You don't need to call enumerate - you aren't using the index. Just use <code>for terms in hexagonal</code>.</p>

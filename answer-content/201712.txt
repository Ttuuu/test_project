<p>The intention of <code>CleanUriString</code> seems to be to return a new string containing only characters from the <code>legalCharacters</code> string.</p>

<p>If <code>CleanUriString</code> is passed a value containing more than one character not in <code>legalCharacters</code> it will return a substring of all the characters up to the last illegal character including any prior illegal characters.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>CleanUriString("asdøæå") //Result = asdøæ
</code></pre>

<p>I would suggest you write a thorough specification of what you expect <code>CleanUriString</code> to do. </p>

<p>Should it strip all illegal characters? Cut the string off at the first illegal character? Outright reject any string with illegal characters?</p>

<p>When that is done rewrite the method step-by-step according to the specification.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>As noted by commenters, you will get multiple definition errors if you try to include this header in multiple translation units. The functions must be marked <code>inline</code>, or the header file reduced to the declarations, with the definitions placed in a separate source file.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>std::string format</code> argument is copied unnecessarily as it is passed by value. It should be passed by <code>const&amp;</code> instead. (Or replaced with <code>std::string_view</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>The difference between all these functions is the format string. As such, we don't really need the functions at all. We can define the format strings as constants, and the user can pass the one they need to <code>get_chrono</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>get_chrono</code> is probably not the best name for the function. Maybe <code>format_time_now</code>, or <code>format_time</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The function would be much less restrictive if the time were passed as an argument. It can then be used for formatting other times than <code>now</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Note also that in the original code, if we wanted to call <code>get_second</code> and <code>get_minute</code> for one point in time (say for some custom output format), we can't! Because <code>now</code> will have changed between the calls, and we might end up with incorrect output.</p></li>

<p>This is not a review, but an extended comment.</p>

<p>Consider the question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given two arrays, <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, find the maximum of <code>A[i] + B[j]</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I suppose you can do it in linear time.</p>

<p>Now rearrange the original equation as <code>(A[k] - k) + (A[j] + j)</code> and consider two auxiliary arrays, formed by <code>A[i] - i</code> and <code>A[i] + i</code>.</p>

<p>Finally realize that you don't need these arrays at all.</p>

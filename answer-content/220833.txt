<p>Yes, in this case it is. As you stated yourself it has "no more meaning". It only exists for the purpose of styling.</p>

<p>This is what the MDN has to say about div:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The HTML Content Division element () is the generic container for
  flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled
  using CSS.</p>
  
  <p>As a "pure" container, the  element does not inherently represent
  anything. Instead, it's used to group content so it can be easily
  styled using the class or id attributes, marking a section of a
  document as being written in a different language (using the lang
  attribute), and so on.</p>

<p>Clippy helps automatically scan for common mistakes in code. Many of these are from its automatic review. Aside from the suggestions in other answers, consider:</p>

<h2>Don't explicitly use return</h2>

<p>in <code>fetch_url</code>, and just leave it as the one word <code>body</code>.</p>

<h2>Don't use <code>&amp;String</code>: use <code>&amp;str</code></h2>

<p>on lines 16 and 59. You should never (unless you're doing some weird stuff with <code>capacity</code>) pass a <code>&amp;String</code>. This is because anything you'd want to do with it can be done with a simple slice instead, i.e. <code>&amp;str</code>. If you take a <code>String</code> as a parameter, then you require your users to allocate memory on the heap, instead of using a slice that they already have.</p>

<h2>Don't bind a variable to an empty type</h2>

<p>on line 60. Aside from being unused entirely, its type is <code>()</code>, meaning that it contains no data anyways.</p>

<h2>Don't use <code>extern crate</code></h2>

<p>That was the old pre-2018 syntax, and you don't even use that syntax for other libraries anyways.</p>

<p>You are using the <code>Double</code> data type for all variables. I think this is a good thing since it should avoid conversions. But it is probably too large for your purpose.</p>

<p>From the doc:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Double (double-precision floating-point)  8 bytes
    -1.79769313486231E308 to -4.94065645841247E-324 for negative values</p>

<p>Perhaps using the <code>single</code> data type is enough ?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Single (single-precision floating-point)  4 bytes     -3.402823E38 to
  -1.401298E-45 for negative values
  1.401298E-45 to 3.402823E38 for positive values</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can try and compare results.</p>

<p>For reference a response I made on another topic, that includes comments about data types: <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/240534/219060">Adding qty If duplicates keys found VBA</a></p>

<p>It is unfortunate that the variable names (a..f) are not descriptive and 
<strong>meaningful</strong>. That makes logic errors harder to spot since the variables look  all the same. Surely all those values have a meaning ?</p>

<p>Something else: if you are doing calculations in a loop and assuming this is in Excel, you can <strong>suspend automatic recalculation</strong> at the beginning of your procedure:</p>

<pre><code>Application.Calculation = xlManual
</code></pre>

<p>Turn it back on when you are done:</p>

<pre><code>Application.Calculation = xlAutomatic
</code></pre>

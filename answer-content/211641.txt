<li><p>There is no reason to initialize <code>i</code> as <code>{c + std::distance(begin, start)}</code>. Upon such initialization you are guaranteed that <code>i == start</code>. A much simpler <code>i{start}</code> suffices.</p></li>
<li><p>Testing for <code>i == size</code>, or <code>i == end</code> inside the loop, as well as tracking two iterators, feels wasteful. Consider splitting the loop into two, e.g:</p>

<pre><code>    for (i = start; i != end; ++i) {
        fn(i);
    }

    for (i = begin; i != start; ++i) {
        fn(i);
    }
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>I am not sure that <code>for_start</code> is a good name. I am also not sure what name would be good. <code>iterate_rotated</code> perhaps?</p></li>
</ul>

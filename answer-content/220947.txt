<p>At first I thought it can be improved in more functional way, but after several minutes I see your solution is pretty optimal and elegant. I see two places for improvement:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>for i, letter in enumerate(phrase):</code> - you don't use <code>i</code> so you don't need <code>enumerate</code>. You can replace it with an ordinary loop: <code>for letter in phrase:</code></p></li>
<li><p>You can add try-except block or check that <code>phrase</code> is actually a string, not a random type object</p></li>
</ul>
    </div>

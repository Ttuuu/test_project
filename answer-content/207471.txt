<p><code>crc</code> should be a pointer to <strong>const</strong> void, as we should not need to modify any of the input.</p>

<p><code>len</code> ought to be <code>std::size_t</code> - it doesn't make sense for it to be signed.</p>

<p>Document the generator polynomial.</p>

<p>Prefer <code>new[]</code> to <code>std::malloc()</code>; prefer <strong>not allocating</strong> to either.</p>

<p>Variable-length arrays are not part of standard C++.</p>

<p>Reinterpreting as <code>uint32_t*</code> will give different results on platforms of different endianness.</p>

<p>Restricting to a maximum of 32 bits of input is very severe.  And the code should check that this restriction is respected, rather than assuming correct usage.  With such a small limit, we could just accept input as a <code>std::uint_fast32_t</code>, rather than as a pointer to memory data.</p>

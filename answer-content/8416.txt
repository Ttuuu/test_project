<p>Congratulations. You've all managed to write Java in Python.</p>

<p>Try something like:</p>

<pre><code>from random import choice
if __name__ == "__main__":
    while True:
        print "1. Rock 2. Paper 3. Scissors"
        val, comp = int(raw_input('Enter your choice Number: ')), choice(range(1,4))
        if val == comp:
            print "Draw. Try again"
        elif val == 1:
            if comp == 2:
                print "You lose"
            if comp == 3:
                print "#WINNING"
        elif val == 2:
            if comp == 3:
                print "You lose"
            if comp == 1:
                print "#WINNING"
        elif val == 3:
            if comp == 2:
                print "You lose"
            if comp == 1:
                print "#WINNING"
</code></pre>

<p>This, even with the ridiculously long if/else statement is better than everything proposed here.</p>

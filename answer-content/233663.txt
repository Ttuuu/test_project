<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>What I see here is either:</p>

<ul>
<li>Trying to sort list based on a value and getting item (or items) from top of the list. In that case you can use comparator and take stuff from top of that list. I don't see argument in being able to access actual "value". I see it as adding more responsibilities to the class.</li>
<li>Trying to filter out and cache some results. In that case I see this as sequence of objects (similar to for example Rx programming) and in that case a simple .filter {} lambda would be enough for me while providing me with more flexibility with how to filter, aggregate data and what to do with them after.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall I don't find this class useful unless for something very specific.</p>
    </div>

<p>Your code is concise and readable... I didn't have any feedback... it really shows how the functional solution is nicer.</p>

<p>I was curious if it could be done with regular expressions and no iteration, so I played around and got:</p>

<pre><code>const numJewelsInStones = (j,s) =&gt; { 
  const m = s.match(new RegExp(`[${j}]`,'g'))
  return m ? m.length : 0 
}
</code></pre>

<p>or even</p>

<pre><code>numJewelsInStones = (j,s) =&gt; s.replace(new RegExp(`[^${j}]`,'g'),'').length
</code></pre>
    </div>

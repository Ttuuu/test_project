<h2>Close on destruction</h2>

<p>You shouldn't need to explicitly close your file member on destruction. Since it's a safe variable and not an unsafe pointer, <code>fstream</code>'s own destructor will be called and the file will be closed.</p>

<h2>Const members</h2>

<p>You should make <code>path</code> <code>const</code>, since it doesn't change over the course of the object's lifetime.</p>

<h2>File object scope</h2>

<p><code>inFile</code> is not opened in the constructor, and it's always used in open/close pairs in your methods. That means that it shouldn't be a member at all; just use local variables. One benefit is that you won't need to explicitly close those files; when the variable goes out of scope the file will be closed.</p>

<h2>Error handling</h2>

<p>If you want to drink more of the OOP kool-aid, you shouldn't be using boolean return values, which is a pattern inherited from C code. Instead, your methods would be <code>void</code>-typed, and you'd throw an exception if something goes wrong.</p>

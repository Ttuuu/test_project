<p>To get the sub-list of the <strong>last n elements</strong> without computing the length first (see comments):</p>

<ul>
<li>Go ahead with an <em>end</em> pointer until you have skipped <em>n</em> elements. </li>
<li>Now go ahead in parallel with a <em>start</em> pointer and the <em>end</em> pointer until the <em>end</em> pointer reaches the end of the list (the <em>start</em> and <em>end</em> pointers will stay <em>n</em> elements apart as you go).</li>
<li>Now <em>start</em> points to the desired sub-list.</li>
</ul>

<p>In an interview, before you implement anything, it's often a good idea to first describe your plan. Counting first works and is no different in terms of the O notation, but I doubt it's what the interviewer wanted to see. Describing your plan can avoid spending time on something the interviewer might not really be interested in.  </p>

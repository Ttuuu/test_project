<p>Here are a list of things that I notice here.</p>

<h3>Indentation and Spacing</h3>

<p>Throughout your code, your indentation and spacing is inconsistent. I would recommend picking a specific tab width and setting this either to 1 tab or the respective amount of spaces. In addition, placing spaces around all operators and before braces will create clarity.</p>

<h3>Useless Destructor</h3>

<pre><code>snake::~snake()
{
    //dtor
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't plan on using your destructor, then adding an implementation is unnecessary.</p>

<h3>Usage of <code>this</code></h3>

<p>Looking through your classes, I notice that you prefix everything with <code>this-&gt;</code>, even though this is unnecessary in C++. If you really need to separate local variables from members, then I would recommend a good naming convention (I use a trailing underscore).</p>

<h3>Random Numbers</h3>

<pre><code>shape.setPosition( (rand()%40)*20, (rand()%30)*20);
</code></pre>

<p>In C++, using the <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/random" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>&lt;random&gt;</code></a> header is recommended over plain old <code>rand()</code> (which you didn't seed with <code>srand()</code>, AFAICT so the fruit location will always be the same every run of the game).</p>

<h3>Use of <code>std::endl</code></h3>

<p>Unless your goal is to specifically flush the console, then you shouldn't be using <code>std::endl</code>. Prefer plain old <code>\n</code> instead.</p>

<h3>A Proper Fixed Timestep</h3>

<pre><code>sf::sleep(this-&gt;time);
</code></pre>

<p>In most games, what you want to aim for is a proper <a href="https://gafferongames.com/post/fix_your_timestep/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">fixed timestep</a>, which helps create deterministic runs with use of delta times in between frames. Good beginner SFML tutorials/books usually cover this and it is a <em>must</em> for a good game loop.</p>

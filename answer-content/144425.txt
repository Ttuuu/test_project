<li><p>The function has no docstring. What does it do? How do I call it? Are there any helpful examples you can present? The text in the post would make a good start.</p></li>
<li><p>The name <code>unpack</code> is poorly chosen. I know that sequence unpacking is the use case that you have in mind, but the function does not actually unpack anything. What it does is to return a fixed-length prefix of a sequence, padding with <code>None</code> if necessary to make it up to the required length. So a name like <code>prefix_pad_none</code> would give a clearer indication of the behaviour. (Compare with the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools-recipes"><code>padnone</code> recipe</a> in the <code>itertools</code> documentation.)</p></li>
<li><p>The pad value <code>None</code> should be a parameter to the function (with default value of <code>None</code>). That's because there are use cases in which you might want to pad a sequence with some other value. For example, zero, one, and NaN are common pad values in mathematical code.</p></li>

<p>Revised code:</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import chain, islice, repeat

def prefix_pad(n, iterable, padvalue=None):
    """Return the first n elements of iterable, padded out with padvalue
    if iterable has fewer than n elements.

    """
    return islice(chain(iterable, repeat(padvalue)), n)
</code></pre>

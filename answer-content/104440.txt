<p>I think you've overcomplicated things for yourself. A fluent API on top of @rolfl's suggested alternative may have a merit, if it's fluent in a more traditional sense. </p>

<p>In particular, I think the builder pattern can be useful here. You could have a builder static inner class that gathers all the parameters such as min, max, default or custom random, number of elements, at each step returning a builder instance, until a final toIntArray or toLongArray call, validating the accumulated parameters. The implementation will be a lot simpler, and there will be no disputes about strong/weak fluency.</p>

<p>The builder could also keep default parameters, such as the random object to use, so that users don't need to specify explicitly.</p>

<p>I would also shorten some of the method names, for example <code>withMin</code> instead of <code>withMinimum</code>. Sure, an IDE auto completes just the same, but it's shorter to read and the meaning is just as obvious.</p>

<p>This'll be a short review, because the code looks okay.</p>

<p>I think that the main problem with your code is that it's hard to figure out what part of the code is used to interact with the GUI vs what code is used to change the tags on the mp3 files.</p>

<p>You should try to separate your code in (at least) two classes : </p>

<ul>
<li>The GUI</li>
<li>The MP3 tagger</li>
</ul>

<p>This way, it's easier to maintain both parts, you could also end up creating a CLI tool that does the same thing as the GUI tool and you wouldn't need to rewrite a thing, you could just reuse the mp3 tagger class.</p>

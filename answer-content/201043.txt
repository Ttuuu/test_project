<p>After reviewing your Java-7 code, it seems that you have counted frequency of each word from magazine and ransom. Then, you are comparing frequencies of both hash map. </p>

<p>Well, this question can also be solved by using <code>ArrayList</code> instead of <code>HashMap</code>. Time complexity of hash map and array list is O(1) and O(n). I have solved this question by making array list of magazine. Then, I started to remove each element (from magazine array list) found in ransom array.  </p>

<p>In your case, you are getting two new maps from <code>getFrequencyMapFromArray()</code> function. From my point of view, this can reduce the overall performance based on length of both (magazine and note) strings. <code>ransom[]</code> is almost same as <code>maganize[]</code>. So, you are creating two maps of almost equal length. </p>

<pre><code>boolean flag = false;
List&lt;String&gt; ll = new ArrayList(Arrays.asList(magazine));

for(int i = 0; i &lt; ransom.length; i++)
{
     if(ll.contains(ransom[i]))
     {
          ll.remove(ransom[i]);
     }
     else
     {
          flag = true;
          break;
     }
}
</code></pre>

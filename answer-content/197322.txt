<p>I would rather write the code as soft as the requested exercise was:</p>

<pre><code>def acronym(phrases):
    acronym = ""
    for word in phrases.split():
        acronym = acronym + word[0].upper()
    return acronym

def main():
    phrases = input("Enter a phrase: ")
    print(acronym(phrases))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
</code></pre>

<p>I changed some variable names to make everything more readable and removed something useless to shorten the code.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You should wrap your code under a <code>if __name__ == "__main__":</code> guard to allow importing parts of your script from other scripts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>as the other guy said.</p>

<p>I can bear that you are a novice and the first times what matters is to make a good and clear code, so you can get the idea next times you have to do something similar.</p>

<p>If it was asked to make the code the shortest possible, then I would suggest something like this:</p>

<pre><code>def main():
    data = input('Enter a phrase: ')
    data = [i[0] for i in data.upper().split(' ')] 
    print(''.join(data))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
</code></pre>

<p>Here we split every word, get its first letter and use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join" rel="nofollow noreferrer">str.join()</a> to print a concatenation of the strings.</p>

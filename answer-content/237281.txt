<p>It's a good idea for <code>worker.c</code> to include <code>"worker.h"</code>, preferably as the very first line.  That ensures that the declarations are consistent and that the header has no missing includes of its own.  (So, in <code>task.c</code> move the <code>task.h</code> include to the top spot, and similarly with <code>utils.h</code> in <code>utils.c</code>.)</p>

<p>I recommend adding include-guards on all your header files.  I know there's no intention to multiply-include any of them, but it can easily happen, particularly when they include each other.</p>

<p>Your error-checking on I/O operations is commendable - well done.  However, I noticed an unchecked <code>malloc()</code> in <code>filepath_join()</code> that should be addressed (in passing, it also has a pointless cast).  All the callers of <code>filepath_join()</code> need to be prepared for that, too.</p>

<p>There's a similar unchecked <code>malloc()</code> and pointless cast in <code>main()</code>, where we initialise <code>process_name</code>.</p>

<p>In <code>main()</code>, we shouldn't assume that <code>errno</code> is unset when we call <code>strtol()</code> - if it's successful, then <code>errno</code> may be left unchanged.</p>

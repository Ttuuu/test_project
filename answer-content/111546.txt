<p>To expand on TheCoffeeCup's answer:</p>

<p>When scanning for matches, make sure to order your tests from least expensive to most expensive (or most trivial to least trivial). You only want to be performing the most expensive scan operations when you absolutely need to.</p>

<p>Depending on the persistence of your grid and the number of searches being performed, you may find it more efficient to pre-convert your 2-dimensional array of characters into a one dimensional array of strings (one string per row).</p>

<p>Expanding on that, searching vertically is essentially the same as searching horizontally except the characters are translated in position. If you create two single dimension arrays of strings - one for horizontal scanning, and one for vertical scanning- you can perform that part of the scanning using the same simple loop. </p>

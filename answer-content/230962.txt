<h2>DRY Code</h2>
<p>There is a programming principle called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" rel="noreferrer">Don't Repeat Yourself Principle</a> sometimes referred to as DRY code. If you find yourself repeating the same code multiple times it is better to encapsulate it in a function. If it is possible to loop through the code that can reduce repetition as well.</p>
<p>This code repeats many times with minor variations:</p>
<pre><code>            int ABx5 = Math.Max(arr[2, 0], arr[1, 0]);
            int ABy5 = Math.Max(arr[2, 1], arr[1, 1]);


            int ABx6 = Math.Min(arr[2, 2], arr[1, 2]);
            int ABy6 = Math.Min(arr[2, 3], arr[1, 3]);
</code></pre>
<p>It might be better to create a function that performs this.</p>
<h2>Complexity</h2>
<p>The function <code>FindPoints()</code> is too complex (does too much). All software design methods include breaking the problem into smaller and smaller pieces until the problem is very easy to solve. Smaller functions are easier to read, write, debug and maintain.</p>
<p>There is a programming principle called the Single Responsibility Principle that applies here. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle" rel="noreferrer">Single Responsibility Principle</a> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>that every module, class, or function should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by that module, class or function.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to the possible function mentioned above in the DRY Code section, it might be better to add a function that only gets the input and creates the arrays, a function that finds the overlap of the rectangles and a function that calculates the area of each rectangle.</p>
<h2>Variable Names</h2>
<p>From the problem description, it is not clear why there are any variable names related to <code>money</code> or <code>compensation</code>, which means that the variables that refer to this are unclear. The variable name <code>T</code> may come from the original problem description on the website, but it isn't clear here either.</p>

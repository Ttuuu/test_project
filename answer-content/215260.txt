<p>First off, this is buggy. If one of the input arrays is empty, you'll get an <code>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</code> - and even if you correct that error, the iterator will stop if it encounters an empty array.</p>

<p>Consider using proper tests with multiple scenarios, especially with edge cases, in order to catch errors like that.</p>

<hr>

<p>Then I get two warnings from Eclipse (other compilers and their settings may differ, but I believe these are "common" warnings, that normally would be raised). You should never have warnings. Code should preferably be adjusted or rewritten to avoid them, or at the very least (if you have a good reason to keep the warning) annotated with <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> and commented on with those reasons.</p>

<p>1) Due to the use of generics together with variable arguments the <code>GlueArrays</code> constructor should have the annotation <code>@SafeVarArgs</code>.</p>

<p>2) The instantiation of the iterator in <code>iterate()</code> is lacking its type parameters. It should be</p>

<pre><code>return new GlueArrayIterator&lt;T&gt;(arrays);
</code></pre>

<p>or, if you are at least using Java 1.7, just</p>

<pre><code>return new GlueArrayIterator&lt;&gt;(arrays);
</code></pre>

<p>Disregarding using a better parser (<a href="http://python.omics.wiki/biopython/examples/read-fasta" rel="nofollow noreferrer">biopython's SeqIO</a>), here are some immediate speed boosts due to better use of vanilla Python:</p>

<p>You don't actually need the <code>counterofsites</code> at all. If you only want the fraction of <code>'-'</code>, this is the same as the average of a sequence of <code>1</code> and <code>0</code>, where the value is <code>1</code> (or equivalently, <code>True</code>) if the character is <code>'-'</code>:</p>

<pre><code>from statistics import mean

def gap_fraction(alignment, i):
    return mean(site == "-" for record in alignment for site in record.seq[i])
</code></pre>

<p>This uses a <a href="https://djangostars.com/blog/list-comprehensions-and-generator-expressions/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">generator expression</a> to flatten the sites.</p>

<p>The other improvement is using a <code>set</code> instead of a <code>list</code> for the to be filtered elements. This is needed since you later do <code>if i not in tofilter</code>, which needs to scan through the whole list in the worst case. With a set this is immediate, i.e. it is <span class="math-container">\$\mathcal{O}(1)\$</span> instead of <span class="math-container">\$\mathcal{O}(n)\$</span>. You will only see a real difference if your number of columns to filter gets large (&gt;&gt;100), though.</p>

<pre><code>to_filter = {i for i in range(length) if gap_fraction(alignment, i) &gt; 0.9}
</code></pre>

<p>I also used a <a href="https://medium.com/@joshuapaulrobin/set-comprehension-in-python3-for-beginners-80561a9b4007" rel="nofollow noreferrer">set comprehension</a> to make this a lot shorter and followed Python's official style-guide, <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP8</a>, which recommends using <code>lower_case_with_underscores</code> for variables and functions.</p>

<p>You should also keep your calling code under a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/419163/what-does-if-name-main-do"><code>if __name__ == "__main__":</code> guard</a> to allow importing from this script form another script without running the code.</p>

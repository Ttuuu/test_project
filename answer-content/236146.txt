<p>Probably the most important thing is to reduce the amount of nested loops. It looks like it's currently n^4, so for every 1,000 items it'll loop around 1,000,000,000,000 times. I solved a similar problem once by having an initial loop which mapped the data structure into a less deeply nested form, and then I didn't need to do as many nested loops.</p>

<p>Also, as a side note, it would be good to name your variables rather than just using letters of the alphabet. Even just small changes like replacing <code>x</code> with <code>num</code> or <code>number</code> would improve the readability quite a bit.</p>

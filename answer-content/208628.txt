<p>You have a lot of code to carefully, almost surgically, merge records from list2 into list1 based on a sorted order.  Why not just (1) quickly merge the 2 lists without regards to order, followed immediately by (2) custom ordering?  Something short like:</p>

<pre><code>mergedList = list1.ToList().Union(list2).ToList();
mergedList = mergedList.OrderBy(x =&gt; x.StartTime).ThenBy(x =&gt; x.EndTime).ToList();
</code></pre>

<p>Also, I think <code>Slot</code> is too generic a name.  I suggest <code>TimeSlot</code> instead.</p>

<p>You have no real checks when adding a time slot that <code>Start</code> occurs before <code>End</code>.  You may also want to make sure all <code>DateTime</code> values are based on the same <code>DateTimeKind</code>.  There is nothing in your code that prevents one time slot based on Utc and another based on Local.</p>

<p><code>Duration</code> is an int representing minutes.  This is ripe for confusion.  You could rename the variable to be <code>DurationInMinutes</code>, but I would recommend using a <code>TimeSpan</code> instead.  This makes the code more understandable with:</p>

<pre><code>Duration = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10);
</code></pre>

<p>Later you will probably be using that <code>Duration</code> with some conditional or other calculation with another <code>DateTime</code> and a <code>TimeSpan</code> is a great fit for that.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE MORE SUGGESTIONS</strong></p>

<p>You are interested in a custom sort for your time slots, but I am guessing you want that sort always.  You might want to consider making <code>TimeSlot</code> implement <code>IEquatable&lt;TimeSlot&gt;</code> and <code>IComparable&lt;TimeSlot&gt;</code>.  You will need to add some methods to help out there, such as <code>Equals</code>, <code>CompareTo</code>, and <code>GetHashCode</code>.</p>

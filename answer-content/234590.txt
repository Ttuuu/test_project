<p>I believe the problem lies in the initialization time. If I am not wrong it is like <code>O(n^2 log n)</code> which might be a problem for tests with large <code>n</code> and small sample size.</p>

<p>To fix it you'll have to redo the whole algo if I am not mistaken.</p>

<p>There is a method that doesn't have the same long initialization problem while retaining the same <code>O(log n)</code> (at least on average, <code>O(log^2 n)</code> at worst) time per iteration - simply build a two dimensional segment tree. Since we work with a permutation it will be rather sparse.</p>

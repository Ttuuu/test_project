<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>A small issue, that is probably no big deal for this program, but could cause problems over smaller timescales than days:</p>

<pre><code>json_data = json.load(data)
for record in json_data["data"]:
    # Time in JSON file also has timezone so i have to use timezone.utc
    today = datetime.now(timezone.utc)
</code></pre>

<p>Having a different definition of "now" for each element in the file is unexpected.  We can ensure consistency by assigning <code>today</code> once, outside the loop.  (That slightly improves efficiency, too - but probably not by enough to measure!)</p>
    </div>

<p>If talking about code readability, I'd recommend you to read PEP-8 at first, for example:</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>def one():
    pass
def two():
    pass
</code></pre>

<p>This is how you <strong>don't want</strong> your code to look like. Instead, it should look like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>def one(): # you can add hints for this function here
    pass

def two():
    '''
    or if it's documentation, you can leave it here
    '''
    pass
</code></pre>

<p>Also, it's better to have newlines between blocks of code and blocks of comments. Don't stack everything in one pile:</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>self.root = root # root is a passed Tk object

#Custom Window Height
#TODO! change to ratio

window_height = 700
window_width = 1000

#Get User Screen Info
screen_width = root.winfo_screenwidth()
screen_height = root.winfo_screenheight()

</code></pre>
    </div>

<p>Perhaps it makes more sense to declare adaptor's interface more C++-, rather than Java-, idiomatic. I mean, define <code>operator*</code> and increment rather than <code>next()</code> etc. You'll need, however, to define a helper sentinel structure to compare against, to get rid of <code>has_next()</code>.</p>

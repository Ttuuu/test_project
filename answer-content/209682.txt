<p>I assume that <code>card_number</code> is an integer. As such, you should not convert it to a <code>str</code>, nor convert it to a <code>list</code>. You should be doing integer operations only, not list operations.</p>

<p>For your learning purposes, I won't rewrite the algorithm for you, but try to rewrite it such that it's represented as a loop over the credit card number, which successively gets divided by 10.</p>

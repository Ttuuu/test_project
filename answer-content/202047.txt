<p>Do you have to use Java?  In SQL:  </p>

<pre class="lang-sql prettyprint-override"><code>INSERT INTO snomedinfo_data 
  (refid, id, effectivetime, active, moduleid, conceptid,
   languagecode, typeid, term, caseSignificanceid)
  SELECT sd.refid, sd.id, sd.effectivetime, sd.active, sd.moduleid, sd.conceptid, 
         sd.languagecode, sd.typeid, sd.term, sd.caseSignificanceid
    FROM snomed_descriptiondata sd JOIN snomed_conceptdata sc ON sd.conceptid = sc.conceptid 
    WHERE sd.active = 1 AND sc.active = 1
</code></pre>

<p>This uses no <code>while</code> loops if that's the criteria.  </p>

<p>In general, you want to do as few SQL/Java transfers of data as possible.  Your original code did three.  This does none.  </p>

<p>The key observation is that if you want to find every entry in a table that corresponds with an entry in another table, you should do a join rather than two separate queries.  This is where your nested <code>while</code> loop was.  You were joining in your Java rather than in SQL.  </p>

<p>And truly, you don't need to bring any of the data back to Java.  It's quite possible to insert from a select in SQL.  </p>

<p>If this is too much data, you might want to <code>LIMIT</code> how many rows you do at once.  So do ten thousand at a time or whatever.  </p>

<p>Test the <code>SELECT</code> before you do the <code>INSERT</code> to make sure that it returns the right data.  </p>

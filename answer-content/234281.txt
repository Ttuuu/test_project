<p>You should remove all static qualifiers, so that you have real object. Maby create a Main.java with the main function so that it is your only class with static. Your distinction between Gui and GameOfLife is good and i would keep it that way. 
You can move the <code>int [][] array = new int [71][71];</code> out of the method to a field from the class GameOfLife and you should rename it to something like "gamefield" or "gamestate". 
These are the important things.</p>

<p>A little thing you can replace:</p>

<pre><code>static int count = 0;
static boolean[] test = new boolean[1];
</code></pre>

<p>with something like:</p>

<pre><code>boolean running = true;
</code></pre>

<p>the hole helper() can be replaced with:</p>

<pre><code>running = !running;
</code></pre>

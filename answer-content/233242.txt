<p>I ran a few examples through the code and I have made the following assumptions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the code calculates the minimum amount of coins needed to produce the user's input</p></li>
<li><p>the user can enter in a custom coin and it will use that as part of its calculations</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Instead of using a matrix, I just found the highest coin which can be used to make change, then subtracted it from the total user inputted amount, and repeated it until there was no change left.</p>

<pre><code>coins = [50000, 20000, 10000, 5000, 2000, 1000, 500, 200, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1]

coinToAdd = int(input("Enter in coin to add to coins:"))
userMoney = int(input("Enter in coin to calculate change:"))
coins.append(coinToAdd)
coins.sort(reverse=True)
totalCoins = 0
while [j for j in coins if userMoney &gt;= j]:
  userMoney = userMoney - [j for j in coins if userMoney &gt;= j][0]
  totalCoins = totalCoins + 1

print(totalCoins)
</code></pre>

<p>While this appears to work, there are a few things about it that are not very clear.</p>

<h2>Reconsider the use of regex</h2>

<p>Rather than using a regex, for the numeric ranges in particular, it may make more sense to capture those values and check them with Java statements.  It would certainly reduce the size and complexity of the regex.</p>

<h2>Document non-obvious constraints</h2>

<p>The current regex includes a 1,253 count, the origin of which is decidedly non-obvious.  <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt" rel="nofollow noreferrer">RFC 1035</a> and <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc822.txt" rel="nofollow noreferrer">RFC 822</a> are both obvious candiates for an authoritative source, but this regex does not conform to either of those.</p>

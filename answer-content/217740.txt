<p><strong>Portability</strong><br>
The function <code>strcasecmp()</code> is a POSIX standard and not a in the C programming standard as pointed out in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31127260/strcasecmp-a-non-standard-function">this stack overflow question</a>. Therefore the <code>sort_entries()</code> function may not compile or link on some systems. It would be better if the program that contained the <code>sort_entries()</code> function also contained a version of <code>strcasecmp()</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Performance</strong><br>
Generally a bubble sort will be implemented as nested loops, the inner loop going over the whole input list to perform as many swaps as possible in a single pass. This implementation restarts at the beginning after a single swap requiring more passes. There is no performance improvement by this single loop over the nested loop implementation, and there may be a performance hit.</p>

<p>If the code swapped the pointers rather than the strings themselves there might be an improvement in the performance.</p>

<p><strong>Variable Scope</strong><br>
It is better from a maintainability perspective and overall code comprehension to create variables as needed rather than create all the variables at the top of the function. It would be better if the variables <code>t</code>, <code>next</code> and <code>value</code> were defined within the loop rather than at the top of the function. The variables <code>t</code> and <code>next</code> are only needed within the if statement.</p>

<p>It's possible to serialize "unserializable" types via reflection, including private unserialized members and properties, though its a pain to deal with arbitrary type, you can certainly deal with all the common types easily, and provide for delegates to serialize/deserialize custom types.
The main thing for dealing with "unknown" types is to find out if they support a Set method - if not, you can't deserialize them, so no point to serialize them.</p>

<p>I assume this assignment if for your own exercise, so giving you the source code of the solution is contraproductive. So I will only give you hints how to rewrite your code. Once done, post it here and we can compare it with my solution.</p>

<ul>
<li>You can avoid a whole inner loop cycle if you look ahead one item in your outer loop. In your example 1, your first loop would compare 7 with all others. Your second loop would compare 1 with all others. Since 1 &lt; 7 you can skip comparing with all others in your first loop and only do the comparisons in your second loop. That means if it gets cheaper to buy every day, then skip until the day it becomes more expensive.</li>
<li>You can avoid a whole inner loop cycle if you remember the old value from the outer loop and compare it to the current value. That means in your example, you compare buyPrice=1 and buyPrice=5. Because 1 &lt; 5, you can skip the inner loop for 5 and just leave maxProfit as it is. In other words, the profit cannot become bigger if you buy it more expensive the next day(s) and sell it with the same price.</li>
<li>Once you go through the inner loop, remember the maximum selling price and its position. The next time you go through the inner loop, you can reuse this maximum instead of iterating through all elements. (of course only if its position is still inside the new inner loop elements). </li>
<li>Just delete the line "if(prices[j] &gt; prices[i])". Subtracting two integers is as fast as comparing them in machine language. </li>
<li>Follow DRY principle (clean code, red grade): instead of copy-pasting "prices[j]" just assign it to a variable with a meaningful name, for example "int buyPrice=prices[j]", in opposition to "int sellPrice=prices[i]".</li>
<li>Guard your code: "prices.length" can throw a nullPointerException!</li>
<li>"if(size == 0 || size == 1)" can be written faster and more clearly as "if(size &lt;= 1)"</li>
</ul>

<p>The maxProfit from your example 1 is 6 - 1 = 5. If more than 1 transaction is allowed, you could buy for 1 (second day) and sell for 5 (third day), then you could again buy for 3 (fourth day) and sell for 6 (fifth day). You overall profit would be 5-1 + 6-3 = 7. That's much more than if only 1 transaction is allowed.</p>

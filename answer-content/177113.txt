<p>The main things that I consider wrong or I don't fully get.</p>

<p><strong>service1</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Probably is just a test case but if not, never name classes in that way.</li>
<li>The <em>try/catch/throw</em> makes no sense to me. You can simply remove them.</li>
<li><em>SqlConnection, Command and reader</em> should always be used within a <em>using</em> clause.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>DALEmployee</strong></p>

<p>What is the concept behind this class? Do you really need it?
If yes, my recommendation would be to inject <em>IService1</em>. You can google <em>dependency injection</em> to get more details.</p>

<p><strong>Controller</strong></p>

<p>If you don't need <em>DALEmployee</em>, you can simply inject <em>IService1</em> directly in the controller.</p>

<p><strong>getEmployees</strong></p>

<p>Generally is weird to me how you achieve the pagination. Generally i would use as parameters <em>CurrentPage</em> and <em>PageSize</em> and for me it seems you that you are using the employee id. How would you extend this if you have to sort by other criteria rather than employee id? Additionaly, you are using a different <em>where</em> on the get count and on the procedure itself, what will lead to wrong pages.
Finally, depending on your sql server version, you may use this operators to paginate.</p>

<p>SELECT * FROM TableName ORDER BY <em>whatever</em> <strong>OFFSET</strong> 10 ROWS <strong>FETCH</strong> NEXT 10 ROWS ONLY;</p>

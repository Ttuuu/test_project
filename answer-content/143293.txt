<p>You have a bug here:</p>

<pre><code>int socket_desc , client_sock , c , *new_sock;
new_sock = malloc(1);
</code></pre>

<p>You're allocating 1 byte with the <code>malloc</code>, <code>int</code>'s are usually bigger than this (typically 4 bytes), so you're borrowing 3 bytes that you don't own.  You should probably be doing:</p>

<pre><code>new_sock = malloc(sizeof *new_sock);
</code></pre>

<p>I'm also not a huge fan of multiple variable declarations on a single line, it makes the code harder to read.  This is amplified when you're mixing normal variables and pointers, which you are here:</p>

<pre><code>int socket_desc , client_sock , c , *new_sock;
</code></pre>

<p>Your approach of a single thread per client is probably going to be ok while you have a reasonable number of clients, however it may have scale-ability issues if you have a large number of clients.  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/14317992/592182">Typically having a pool of threads to manage the connections can be more efficient</a>.</p>

<p>You are on the right track, and I think you would benefit by having your class implement the Java <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> interface like so:</p>

<pre><code>public class LinkedList&lt;T&gt; implements List&lt;T&gt; {
</code></pre>

<p>You would then have to change your methods so that their names and signatures conform to the interface. You can read about the details <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/List.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> for Java 7 or <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/List.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> for Java 8. If you do this then you could pass instances of your class into already implemented functions like <code>Collections.sort</code>.</p>

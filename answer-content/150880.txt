<p>Your current situation:</p>

<p>You are storing all the visited numbers in a list and then querying only <strong><em>the size</em></strong> of the list. Instead of doing this you can instead have a single variable that keeps track of <em>the number</em> of visited numbers. You don't need a list.</p>

<hr>

<p>Optimal solution:</p>

<p>Remember all the visited numbers and for each number <em>store the number of visited numbers</em>. For example, for the number 3 the next number is 10. So calculate the Collatz sequence for the number 10 and then add one. Then when your outer loop actually reaches the number 10, you can use the number you calculated before as you already know the Collatz Sequence for the number 10.</p>

<p><em>Hint: There is a good data structure you could use for this</em></p>

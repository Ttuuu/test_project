<p>I'm also beginner, so not sure if can make a good review, but just want to notice. If you just need to replace a bunch of string (the list of colors), maybe it's better to use Aho-Corasick algorithm to find all matches and then just use fold through all matches. I did it for similar task.<br>

I used this implementation:<br>

As I remember, I had some issues and made changes in this library to make it working with the current GHC version, but these were very simple changes.<br>
But it will be very interesting for me to read answers.</p>

<p>P.S. I remembered what was the problem and how I "solve" it. I just used this commit from this fork:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/stackbuilders/AhoCorasick/commit/9a825aef5d19c707d2306befca688a1a72d50bb0" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/stackbuilders/AhoCorasick/commit/9a825aef5d19c707d2306befca688a1a72d50bb0</a><br>
Someone already fixed the issue. So just add in stack.yaml  </p>

<p>The answer from @Reinderien covers a lot of things well. I want to particularly pick up on the Global Variables aspect as I think it's the single part that will help you to improve your code the most.</p>
<p>You seem to have down the idea that functions take an input and that you can get an output from them using <code>return</code>, but you don't seem to use that output in the <code>run</code> function. Giving the intermediate variables name would also make it easier to work out what stage you were at.
e.g.</p>
<pre><code>def run(): 
    ...
    c_dna_seq = DNA_to_cDNA(seq)
    rna_seq = transcription(c_dna_seq)
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>Another thing that I would recommend for readability is using verbs for function names rather than nouns. e.g. <code>convert_dna_to_cdna()</code> or <code>transcribe(seq)</code></p>

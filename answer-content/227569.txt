<p>Whenever possible put the styling in the CSS. Avoid doing it in the JavaScript like this.
For example, you could add it to your <code>.dice</code> style. (Note: same goes for other parts of your code)</p>

<pre><code>diceDOM.style.display = 'block';
</code></pre>

<p>Use shorthand <code>+=</code>. (Note: same goes for other parts of your code)</p>

<pre><code>roundScore =roundScore + dice + diceTwo;
</code></pre>

<p>'array' is a bad name for a variable. It's not descriptive.
It's also a keyword in a lot of languages, so you should avoid it anyway</p>

<pre><code>array[i]=dice;
</code></pre>

<p>No need for an if statement here, both paths do the same thing</p>

<pre><code>if (dice == 6 &amp;&amp; array[i-2] ==  6 ) {
    nextPlayer();
}

} else  { 
    nextPlayer();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Change your ternary from this:</p>

<pre><code>activePlayer === 1 ? activePlayer = 0 : activePlayer = 1;
</code></pre>

<p>to this:</p>

<pre><code>activePlayer = activePlayer === 1 ? 0 : 1;
</code></pre>

<p>Hopefully your 'challenges' were posted by a mistake, as a result of copying &amp; pasting the instructions.
It wouldn't be right to do any part of your assignment for you. Code reviewing it is already crossing a line, probably.</p>

<p>However I will say the challenge should definitely get you thinking about ways to refactor your code.
In real life changes happen all the time. The customer suddenly wants this or that feature added. You should always write you code in such a way it can be changed easily.</p>

<p>For example what if you want to erase the score on a '6' roll? You'd need to scroll through your code looking for the area that handles dice rolls.
But if you had a method it's blanetly obvious (As an added bonus, easier to read the code):</p>

<pre><code>function shouldScoreBeErased(dice1, dice2)
{
    return dice1 == 1 || dice2 == 1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You should also have a method for erasing the score etc.
To add the dice being 6 twice in a row feature, you'd need to keep track of previous rolls as well. (Tbh you should be anyways, showing the history of the game at the end could be a nice feature!)</p>

<p>You should also have a method for writing the score, dice etc to the DOM. Again making it easier for maintanability.</p>

<p>Instead of 'dice1' and 'dice2' I strongly recommend using an array of dice. Again for maintanability (adding new dice or removing one). It also gets rid of the grammer awkwardness ('1 Dice' is actually called a 'die')</p>

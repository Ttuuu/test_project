<p>Since Java 7, the recommended way of closing <code>Closeable</code> resources such as <code>Scanner</code> is to use <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/tryResourceClose.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>try-with-resources</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in)) {
    // ...
}
// no need for explicit scanner.close() here, 
// since the variable is scoped within the try statement and will be closed at the end
</code></pre>

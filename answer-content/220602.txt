<p>Some ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li>A recursive solution is only as efficient as the equivalent iterative solution if the compiler/interpreter is smart enough to unroll it into an iterative solution. I'd love to be corrected, but I don't believe the Python interpreter is able to unroll recursive algorithms such as this one. If that is so, an iterative solution will be more efficient. An intermediate solution would be to create a cache of values returned so far to avoid having to recompute every value at every step.</li>
<li><p>This code, like basically any Python code, could benefit from a run through Black, flake8 and mypy with a strict configuration like this:</p>

<pre><code>[flake8]
exclude =
    .git,
    __pycache__
max-complexity = 4
ignore = W503,E203

[mypy]
check_untyped_defs = true
disallow_untyped_defs = true
ignore_missing_imports = true
no_implicit_optional = true
warn_redundant_casts = true
warn_return_any = true
warn_unused_ignores = true
</code></pre></li>
<li>Taking user input interactively is bad, because it means your code can't be included in non-interactive code. Use <code>argparse</code> to get a value when starting the program.</li>
</ul>

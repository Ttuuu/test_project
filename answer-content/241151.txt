<p>New list here just contains links to list_of_json objects, it shouldn't consume much memory, so getting rid of it won't save much either.
Variables that reference to all objects (here dicts) are kept until the function is active. I'd suggest split the data flow into chain of functions to reduce temp objects reference count to 0 and make garbage collector get rid of them. </p>

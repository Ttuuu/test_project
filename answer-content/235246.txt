<p>Apart from Oliver Schonrock's suggestions, I'd like to add:</p>

<h1>Be consistent</h1>

<p>You write <code>std::cout</code> but <code>cin</code>. Either consistently prefix standard library symbols with <code>std::</code> (the preferred way), or leave it out everywhere in files where you have <code>using namespace std</code>.</p>

<p>Also, be consistent in the language you are using. Some of the lines you print are in Norwegian, others in English. In fact, in some sentences you mix both.</p>

<p>I'd recommend you switch to English everywhere, unless there is a requirement for Norwegian variable names, comments and/or output.</p>

<h1>Focus on one thing</h1>

<p>Why is this program checking usernames? It makes no sense to me. If the assignment is to implement a program that calculates volts, ohms and amperes based on Ohm's law, then just focus on that.</p>

<p>There isn't going to be a significant difference between C and C++ when using the same algorithm.</p>

<p>Using a <code>while</code> loop versus a <code>for</code> loop in this case will not have a significant difference either. The loop is only going to sum 5 values.</p>

<p>The problem is the algorithm, as another answer pointed out do as much of the sorting as possible as the numbers are input. Don't input directly into the array, because that forces the sort, input into a variable and compare the variable against the the contents of the already sorted array, only replace the numbers in the array if the new number is larger.</p>

<p>If the program was broken up into functions you could profile it to see where it was spending the most time, but it is obvious that the sort is the time sink. Breaking it up into function might help with writing the code and debugging as well.</p>

<p>I agree with all of the other reviews but I would recommend you to use a a switch statement instead of long if-elses.</p>

<pre><code>switch(input){
case 1:
// do stuff
break;
case 2:
// do other stuff
break;
case 3:
// do other stuff
break;
default:
// Invalid input
break;
}
</code></pre>

<p>In my opinion this increases readability and provides a good way of checking states and catching invalid inputs.</p>

<p>To clear the console screen your are using <code>system("clear")</code> which is okay, but not good practise because its OS-specific. For Unix based systems like MacOS and Linux this would cause undefined behaviour or simply do nothing. A workaround that is portable and can be used on *NIX platforms is simply using ANSI escape characters:</p>

<pre><code>void clear() {
    // CSI[2J clears screen, CSI[H moves the cursor to top-left corner
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "\x1B[2J\x1B[H";
}
</code></pre>

<p>(Taken from User Cat Plus Plus from this thread <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6486289/how-can-i-clear-console">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6486289/how-can-i-clear-console</a>)</p>

<p>Now you have to options, either determine which OS the program runs or just trying both <code>system(clear)</code> and <code>clear()</code>.</p>

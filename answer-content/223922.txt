<p>You have a memory leak. Well several.</p>

<p>All of the <code>static char *</code> functions allocate memory using <code>malloc()</code> which is never freed.</p>

<p>Now let's take a look at how they are used, for example</p>

<pre><code>strcpy(sweepSpeed, getSweepSpeed(currentLine, i));
</code></pre>

<p>So <code>getSweepSpeed()</code> is returning a pointer to a string, which is immediately copied into another string <code>sweepSpeed</code>, then the returned pointer is discarded and the buffer allocated by <code>getSweepSpeed()</code> is leaked.</p>

<p>An alternative which would work here would be to get <code>getSweepSpeed()</code> to write its result directly into the buffer <code>sweepSpeed</code>. So the call becomes</p>

<pre><code>getSweepSpeed(currentLine, i, sweepSpeed);
</code></pre>

<p>and the function definition becomes</p>

<pre><code>static void getSweepSpeed(char* line, int linePosition, char * speed)
</code></pre>

<p>I'm sure you can do the rest..</p>

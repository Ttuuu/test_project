<p><strong>Python is not Java</strong> (or C++, or ...). There is no need to have a getter and setter for every attribute.</p>

<ul>
<li>Instead of calling <code>card.modify_weight(new_suit_weight=3)</code>, you can just do <code>card.suit_weight = 3</code>, so that method is not needed at all.</li>
<li>Instead of calling <code>card.get_suit()</code>, just use <code>card.suit</code>, so all those <code>get_*</code> methods are superfluous.</li>
</ul>

<p>The rest looks fine to me, except for the closing part of the docstring of <code>Card</code>, those <code>"""</code> should be indented the same distance the opening <code>"""</code> are.</p>

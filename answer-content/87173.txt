<p>I'd say a combination of both would be best.</p>

<p>So first of all I'd favour less code, so <code>static</code> import all the things.</p>

<p>The <code>times(1)</code> is arguably good, I think the notes on the Mockito docs
were saying that it depends on whether you really want to make sure that
you only call it once, or whether you just want to test that "it
happened" at all. Also, as @fge said, <code>times(1)</code> is the default, so leave it out.</p>

<p><code>any(String.class)</code> is better than <code>isA</code>, because it clarifies intent; since <code>String</code> is <code>final</code>, you can't get a subclass there, so <code>isA</code> is in a sense too broad.  Then again, <code>anyString</code> would be best, since it is shorter than the alternative and also checks for <code>null</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>doAnswer</code> is probably not necessary?  I mean <em>if</em> you return a
value, I'd probably check that it's passed through unharmed as well.  Also, I think usually you don't need <code>doAnswer</code>, but you can use a simpler way of returning the value; <code>doAnswer</code> would be needed for throwing exceptions etc.</p>

<p>Why do the tests have a <code>throws</code> clause though?</p>

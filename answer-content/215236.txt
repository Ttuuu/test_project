<p>That's a very good code. Speaking of the things that are written in it, there is very little I would <em>change</em>. Only a few things are coming to my mind, </p>

<ul>
<li>I would move the database connection code into a separate file and then just include in other scripts that needed a database connection.</li>
<li>Using the Refresh header is old fashioned, inconvenient and buggy. I would rather redirect a user to the newly created account page. So they would know that an account has been created at once.</li>
<li>I wouldn't hardcode a particular hashing algorithm, and rather use PASSWORD_DEFAULT instead. </li>
</ul>

<p>That's all. But of course some things could be <em>added</em> to this code as well. You can add some verifications, like as to see </p>

<ul>
<li>if the username is not empty or already exists</li>
<li>whether the password is not strong enough</li>
<li>whether email follows the proper format or already exists</li>
<li>all other verifications you can think of</li>
</ul>

<p>And for this purpose it is useful to make $msg not a string but an array of strings, to collect all possible errors in one variable. You can check this approach in my <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/214895/101565">recent answer</a></p>

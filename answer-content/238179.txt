<p>You never use your <code>Map</code> to lookup a filter function by its key. If you don't need any of the keys then you don't really need a <code>Map</code>.</p>

<pre><code>def filterTwitter(str :String) :String =
  List(Twitter.removeRT
      ,Twitter.removeNickName
      ,Twitter.removeURL
      ,Emoticons.removePunctRepetitions
      ,Emoticons.removeHorizontalEmoticons
      ,Emoticons.normalizeEmoticons
      ,Beautify.removeCharRepetitions
      ,Beautify.removeNSpaces
      ).foldRight(str)(_(_))
</code></pre>

<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>

<p>The 1st underscore is an element from the <code>List</code> that is being folded. Because this is a fold <strong>Right</strong>, it will start with the last element (<code>removeNSpaces</code>) and work toward the head (<code>removeRT</code>).</p>

<p>The 2nd underscore is the result from the previous invocation and it is being passed as an argument to the filter function. (Actually it's a little more complicated than that, but this is an easy way to think about it.)</p>

<p>So this is what's going down:</p>

<pre><code>removeNSpaces(str)             ===&gt; resStr1
removeCharRepetitions(resStr1) ===&gt; resStr2
normalizeEmoticons(resStr2)    ===&gt; resStr3
. . .
removeRT(prevResStr)           ===&gt; finalResStr
</code></pre>

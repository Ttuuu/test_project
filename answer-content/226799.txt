<p>You don't need the special case for <code>k == 0</code>. When <code>k == 0</code>, the result of the other expression will be 1 as well.</p>

<p>For this sequence of binomial coefficients you don't need to calculate the full <code>fak</code> expression each time. You can also start with <code>c = a ** i</code>, and then, for each k, multiply by <code>(n - k) / (k + 1) * b / a</code>. That's a bit faster and provides less risk of producing numeric overflows, which would result in slightly incorrect coefficients. The Wikipedia article on binomial coefficients should explain this in more detail.</p>

<p>You might like to consider the downside of all of the array/enumerable methods â€“ poor performance, and not necessarily better looking code.</p>

<p>Sometimes, simpler can be better.</p>

<pre><code>original.length.times.reject { |idx| original[idx] == other[idx] }.size
</code></pre>

<p>This creates one array, whereas decomposing two string of 15 characters each into array and then manipulating them can easily create 15 arrays and 30 strings during the processing. What if you have strings of 10,000 characters?</p>

<p>If your code does not have to create new objects then I'd suggest at least considering not doing so.</p>

<p>ps. if you knew that the strings were ASCII then you could ...</p>

<pre><code>original.bytesize.times.reject { |i| original.getbyte(i) == other.getbyte(i) }.size
</code></pre>

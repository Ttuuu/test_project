<p>If I can make a recommendation, while it is virtuous to write your own parser, there are parser-generators for implementing new languages that help you focus on the end application instead of a great deal of the implementation details. I have used <a href="http://www.antlr.org/download.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ANTLR</a> successfully. They have bindings for C++, which may just suit your needs. If you choose this route, I would also recommend the Antlr Reference Manual from Pragmatic Programmers. In a couple of days you should be able to implement what you're looking for. </p>

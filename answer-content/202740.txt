<blockquote>
  <p>database connection code in many files instead of single file, is there any problem with that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing critical, but what if your database credentials would change? Are you going to edit all these files?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>is it correct to use below 2 lines ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, apart from the fact that DBController doesn't seem to belong here. Where did you get that and why do you think it is needed?</p>

<p>Besides, in your example you seem to be using both ways, including database.php <strong>and</strong> writing the connection code right in the script. You should use only one method. </p>

<p>there are other issues in your code</p>

<ul>
<li>you should never ever use a code like <code>echo "Failed to connect to MySQL: " . mysqli_connect_error();</code>. Read my article on the <a href="https://phpdelusions.net/articles/error_reporting" rel="nofollow noreferrer">proper error reporting</a></li>
<li>same goes for the <code>if ($result=mysqli_query($con,$sql))</code> condition. It effectively mutes the possible error message which will never reach you. You should never run a query inside a condition like that. Just let the error go.</li>
<li>you should never ever select all rows from a database only to count them. <a href="https://phpdelusions.net/top#num_rows" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Ask a database to count the rows instead</a>. </li>
</ul>

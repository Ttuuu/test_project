<p>You've actually improved the design, because now unit tests can inject their own context and thus the <code>shutdown()</code> becomes testable. Pure gold.</p>

<p>But your stated reasons make me wary. I'd pass a parameter (e.g. struct) to <code>Start()</code> or <code>NewServer()</code>  There aren't many good uses of <code>WithValue</code> that make your code more readable and neater.</p>

<p>Also docs for WithValue warn that "The provided <code>key</code> must be comparable and should not be of type <code>string</code> or any other built-in type to avoid collisions between packages using context." So that's a big problem with your example.</p>

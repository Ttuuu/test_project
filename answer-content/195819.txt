<ul>
<li><p>What is the point of <code>clear_session</code> it is never called without also calling <code>initiate_quiz</code> yet repeats the same code.</p></li>
<li><p>I would define a constant for the number of questions (or pass it as a parameter) rather than repeating it.</p></li>
<li><p>Usually I expect a method with a noun name like <code>remaining_words</code> to return the remaining words. Since this method does other things I would call it something else maybe <code>get_words</code> or <code>initialize_words</code></p></li>
<li><p>I also avoid doing redirects inside methods that are doing calculations. i.e. I would move the redirect out of <code>remaining_words</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>save_score_to_db</code> could be turned into a single line using <code>Score.create(...)</code></p></li>

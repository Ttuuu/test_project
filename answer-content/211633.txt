<p>Looking at the documentation of <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/PyPDF2/PdfFileReader.html#PyPDF2.PdfFileReader.decrypt" rel="noreferrer">PdfFileReader.decrypt</a> It states that it return 0 if the file fails or 1 if it succeeds.</p>

<p>You can also use isEncrypted to check if the file was encrypted in the first place.</p>

<p>So you can turn the loop around. First open the pdf file see if it was encrypted at all and if so try to call <code>decrypt</code> with every password in your dictionary.</p>

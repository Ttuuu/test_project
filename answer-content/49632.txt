<p>I agree with your teacher that breaking the code into functions will help the readability of your code. </p>

<p>For example, put the code, for the result of each decision, in its own function.</p>

<pre><code>cout &lt;&lt; "1. Go West" &lt;&lt; endl;
...

if (choice2 == 1) {
    go_west();
} else if (choice2 == 2) {
    go_east();
} else if (choice2 == 3) {
    wait();
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I am reading the code this makes it much easier to figure out what is happening. What happens if I input <code>2</code>? I do not need to skip over all the go west or wait for something to happen code because they are in functions somewhere else. If I am interested in that code then I look at the function.</p>

<p>This also helps if two routes lead to the same result, you do not need to copy and paste the code you simply call the same function.</p>

<p>If you have learned about switch statements then it might get you some more points to use a switch instead of if/else.</p>

<pre><code>switch (choice2) {

case 1:
    go_west();
    break;
case 2:
    go_east();
    break;
case 3:
    wait();
    break;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is not very important in the real world though. Use whichever you think looks better.</p>

<p>It would also be an idea to use <code>enums</code> or constant values when processing the decision points. If I look at the if/else statements I need to remember: does 1 mean east or west?</p>

<pre><code>#define WEST 1
#define EAST 2
#define WAIT 3

if (choice2 == WEST) {
    go_west();
} else if (choice2 == EAST) {
    go_east();
} else if (choice2 == WAIT) {
    wait();
}
</code></pre>

<p>A more advanced strategy would be to use a jump table.</p>

<pre><code>void(*tbl[4])(void) = { 
    &amp;invalid_input,
    &amp;go_west,
    &amp;go_east,
    &amp;wait
};

cin &gt;&gt; choice2;

if (choice2 &gt; 3)
    choice2 = 0;

tbl[choice2]();
</code></pre>

<p>This may not be a viable option for you at your current stage but it might help other people or yourself later on in your education.</p>

<h1>DB query</h1>
<p>Check how you can use LINQ with mySQL. The query code will be shorter and readable with LINQ. Also, syntax errors are caught at compile time.</p>
<p>Regardless of my suggestion to use  LINQ, here my review of your current implementation :</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Don't ever concatenate strings to create a query. This way is vulnerable to SQL Injection. Use query parameters instead.</p>
</li>
<li><p>No need for count(*), just check the number of rows in the DataTable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Error handling</h1>
<p>You show a message box with the exception. It means nothing to the user. Also, it is considered not safe to show internal errors.</p>
<p>I suggest at least to add a human-friendly error like "an error occurred, please send this to XXX Exception message "</p>
<p>I guess you did this so the user will pass you the error.<br>
These are the approaches I am familiar with:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write the errors in log and add a way for the user to send it to you.</li>
<li>Use a library that reports errors to an external service.</li>
</ol>
<p>When the user doesn't succeed to connect aka <code>connection.Open</code> fails. The user gets an error message of the exception.</p>
<h1>Store User</h1>
<p>I assume <code>Dashboard</code> needs the user.</p>
<p>I don't understand why user is a member of the form; it is not used anywhere.</p>
<p>Create user after the query and pass it to <code>Dashboard</code>.</p>

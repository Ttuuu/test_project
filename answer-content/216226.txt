<p>What threw me off for a short while is your usage of <code>six.moves.range</code>, but I see now that it is for compatibility. However, you can make this usage more transparent by importing it like this:</p>

<pre><code>from six.moves import range
</code></pre>

<p>I would also use <code>random.SystemRandom().randint</code> instead of <code>randrange</code> because it is inclusive and makes it that slight bit more readable. Note "dice" is already the plural of "die", "dices" is not an English word.</p>

<pre><code>RNG = random.SystemRandom()

def roll_dice(nrolls, ndice=5):
    """Rolls a number of dice (default: 5) n times"""
    return [[RNG.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(ndice)] for _ in range(nrolls)]
</code></pre>

<p>I also made the random number generator a global constant, no need to redefine that every time you roll the dice and made it list comprehensions instead of tuples on generator expressions, mostly so it fits into one line.</p>

<p>Parsing the output of <code>ifconfig</code> is problematic: different versions have slightly different output formats, and it's hard to make code sufficiently flexible enough to handle them all.  And it's impossible, in general, to also handle future output formats.</p>

<p>You're probably better off using <code>ip addr</code>, which has a more consistent and predictable output format.</p>

<p>The <code>doctest</code> cases in the docstring aren't very good unit tests - they might be correct for your machine at the time of writing, but they are too fragile, as they depend on environment outside your control.</p>

<p>Well, I would prefer not to have a private Node class inside the BinaryTree class.
I think that the logic for adding/removing nodes in the tree should be done at the Tree class and not at the Node class level.</p>

<p>Maybe move the Node class into its own file, rename it to BinaryNodeTree and move the add/remove logic to the tree itself, which can use a utility class for searching the node to add the value too.</p>

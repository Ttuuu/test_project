<p>I have one other addition to what Loki has already pointed out.</p>

<p>The C++ committee has voted to deprecate inheriting from <code>std::iterator</code> as of C++17. The current recommendation is apparently to write those <code>typedef</code>s yourself.</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;typename K, typename V&gt;
class MapValueIterator {
public:
    typedef V value_type;
    typedef std::ptrdiff_t difference_type;
    typedef V *pointer;
    typedef V &amp;reference;
    typedef std::ForwardIteratorTag iterator_category;

// ...
</code></pre>

<p>Feel free to read <a href="http://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2016/p0174r0.html#2.1" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the proposal to deprecate it</a>, if you care about why they're doing it (and such).</p>

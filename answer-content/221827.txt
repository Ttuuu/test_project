<h3>A couple of minor remarks</h3>
<p>The <em>active layout</em> is used in various locations. Perhaps you should create a getter for it to avoid redundant code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>let activeLayout = getRoot(self).stage.activeLayout;</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Writing in a fluent style is a delight for the eye, but it should not come at too much cost in code quality. <code>getParent(self, 2)</code> should have been set in a local variable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>return getParent(self, 2).selection === self &amp;&amp; getParent(self, 2).stage.dragging</code></p>
</blockquote>

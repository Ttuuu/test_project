<p>Some suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li>I would usually inline single line functions unless what they do is hard to understand from just reading the command. <code>filesize</code> might be one such candidate.</li>
<li>I believe that not specifying the block size can be faster, by allowing Python to use whatever block size it thinks is appropriate. This would need some actual testing though.</li>
<li><p>Your function arguments are only partially typed. You might want to use a stricter <code>mypy</code> configuration, such as the following, in your setup.cfg:</p>

<pre><code>[mypy]
check_untyped_defs = true
disallow_untyped_defs = true
ignore_missing_imports = true
no_implicit_optional = true
warn_redundant_casts = true
warn_return_any = true
warn_unused_ignores = true
</code></pre></li>
<li>MD5 was optimized for cryptographic use, not for speed. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/5400275/96588">Another Q&amp;A</a> explores options for fast non-cryptographic hashing.</li>
<li>I would avoid converting digests to strings - it might be slightly easier for debugging purposes, but data type conversions are in general very costly.</li>
<li>Optional parameters mean you have to test at least <em>two</em> things rather than one. Your code only ever calls the <code>hash_*</code> functions without optional parameters, so you might as well either inline them.</li>
<li>On a related note, static values which are used in multiple places are perfect for pulling out as constants. The hashing function and block size would be obvious candidates for this.</li>
<li><a href="https://effbot.org/zone/default-values.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Mutable default parameter values</a> are an accident waiting to happen. The default pattern for this is to use a default of <code>None</code> and to assign a default <code>if foo is None</code>.</li>
<li>r-strings like <code>r"./testdata"</code> are meant for regular expressions. Since <code>pic_dir</code> is not used as such it should probably be a regular string.</li>
<li><code>duplicates</code> is at first a list of <em>potential</em> duplicates and later is trimmed in stages. This makes the code hard to follow.</li>
<li>Things like the directory/directories to include should be arguments. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>argparse</code></a> can deal with this easily.</li>
<li>To make this more scriptable I would print the result on standard output. It's trivial to then redirect it to a file.</li>
</ul>

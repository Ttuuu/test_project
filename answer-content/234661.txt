<p>I doubt if all those logic is meant to be in the ApplicationHelper. You could create a new helper file and move that logic.</p>

<p>As you have three constant values declared within the method body, you can move them outside as constants, and modify the value of <code>total_stars</code> depending on the conditions you have:</p>

<pre><code>ZERO_STAR_ICON_NAME = "star"
FULL_STAR_ICON_NAME = "star_fill"
HALF_STAR_ICON_NAME = "star_lefthalf_fill"

def show_star_rating(rating)
  round_by_half = (rating * 2).round / 2.0
  total_stars = Array.new(round_by_half, FULL_STAR_ICON_NAME)
  total_stars += [HALF_STAR_ICON_NAME] if round_by_half - round_by_half.to_i == 0.5
  total_stars += Array.new(5 - total_stars.size, ZERO_STAR_ICON_NAME) unless total_stars.size == 5
end
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>You can use <code>unless</code> whenever you have a <code>!=</code> condition to make the statement more clear.</li>
<li>You can use <code>Array.new</code> to create a new array and sum (<code>+=</code>) it to the current value of <code>total_stars</code>.</li>
</ul>

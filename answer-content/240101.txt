<p>Currently your code has user input, calculation and output all mixed up. This is OK as a first step (your code works, yay!), but the next step should be separating the calculation from the IO part. For this a simple function which takes the input already as parsed numbers will do:</p>

<pre><code>def clock_angles(hour, minute, second):
    """Convert the time in hour, minute, second into angles of clock hands
       on a 12 hour clock, in degrees."""
    if hour &gt;= 12:
        hour -= 12
    assert 0 &lt;= hour &lt; 12 and 0 &lt;= minute &lt; 60 and 0 &lt;= second &lt; 60
    degrees_per_hour = 360 / 12
    degrees_per_minute = degrees_per_second = 360 / 60
    return (hour * degrees_per_hour,
            minute * degrees_per_minute,
            second * degrees_per_second)
</code></pre>

<p>It even has a <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/" rel="noreferrer"><code>docstring</code></a> describing what it does and some simple input validation.</p>

<p>Your IO can then be wrapped under a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/419163/what-does-if-name-main-do"><code>if __name__ == "__main__":</code> guard</a> which ensures it is not being run when you import from this script from another script. You can also use a <a href="https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/" rel="noreferrer"><code>f-string</code></a> to make formatting the output slightly easier.</p>

<pre><code>if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_time = input("Please input a time (HH:MM:SS): ")
    hour, minute, second = map(int, input_time.split(":"))

    hour_angle, minute_angle, second_angle = clock_angles(hour, minute, second)
    print(f"When the time is {input_time} the hour hand is at {hour_angle}°, the minute hand is at {minute_angle}° and the second hand is at {second_angle}°.")
</code></pre>

<p>I included the second hand here. Being able to parse the input without the seconds is left as an exercise.</p>

<p>Some general improvements:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use <code>&lt;cstdlib&gt;</code>, not <code>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</code>.  The latter is a deprecated header that is kept for C compatibility.  It should not be used in new C++ code. </li>
<li>Do not use <code>void</code> in an empty parameter list.  It is counterintuitive and is not necessary in C++ at all.  It is only used in C prototypes.</li>
<li>The copy constructor should take by const reference because it does not modify the argument.  Same for <code>push</code>. </li>
<li>You are using assignment in constructors when you ought to use member initializer clauses.  This is bad practice. </li>
<li><code>front</code> should return by const reference, not by value.  Returning by value makes an unnecessary copy. </li>
<li><code>MAX_SIZE</code> is not a macro and should not be in ALL_CAPS.  And it should be <code>constexpr</code>.  Or better, a template parameter. </li>
<li>It is advised in C++ to use <code>std::array</code> instead of raw arrays. </li>
</ol>

<p>There are still many things to improve, but this should be enough to get you started. </p>

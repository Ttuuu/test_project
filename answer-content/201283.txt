<p>The only method that I'm aware of to avoid modulo bias is to just exclude some bytes so that the number of possible values is a multiple of the array's length, and all the numbers are consecutive. Something like this should work if your strings are not more than 256 characters long.</p>

<pre><code>random_index(length):
    m = 256 % length
    n = next_byte()
    while n &lt; m:
        n = next_byte()
    return n % length
</code></pre>

<p>However, there are two problems with this approach. Firstly, this will need an unpredictable number of bytes, so you need to be able to get more on-demand. Secondly, I'm no expert in C#, but this code seems way too low-level. Any decent library should provide some kind of <code>choose</code> function you can use to simply pick a character from an array.</p>

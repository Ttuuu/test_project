<p>My main objection was against AccountAdmin Controller. Your latest comment makes my point a bit moot, but here it is anyway.</p>

<p>This controller knows too much about the details of account management. It's not cool that you have to remove and re-add a password to reset it, and these operations pollute your code. A useful approach is to create a helper class to collect all the dirty elements in one place, until you find a better solution. For example, create a UserManagerHelper class with a ResetPassword method. This way your controller code can remain clean, and the strange remove password + re-add password stuff could be encapsulated and hidden in the helper.</p>

<p>Another thing that's not cool about this class is the two variants of the ResetPassword. The inspection from one to the other is confusing, and it seems to result in an unnecessary validity check when coming from a GET request. It would be better to factor out the common logic to a third method, and these two method should not call each other.</p>

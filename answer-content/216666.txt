<p>I think it's cool that you fetch the pages in parallel.</p>

<h3>A minor miss of the spec</h3>

<p>The description says to <em>not return</em> from <code>getMovieTitles</code>,
but the implementation does that.</p>

<p>I agree the early return makes sense when there is a single page of results.
I would have extracted to a function the code that fetches results.
Then the caller could simply call <code>sortAndPrintResults</code> on the returned array.</p>

<h3>Things I find weird</h3>

<p><code>return sortAndPrintResults(matches)</code> is weird because <code>sortAndPrintResults</code> is void.</p>

<p><code>sortAndPrintResults</code> joins the results before printing to console,
which doubles the memory used by the results.
It would have been better to call <code>console.log</code> in a loop.</p>

<p>I find the name <code>fillRange</code> misleading.
Basically it creates a sequence of numbers.
That's not what I would guess from the name.</p>

<p>It's a pity to construct an array of numbers just to loop over them.</p>

<p>These two issues could be fixed by implementing a <code>range</code> function as an <em>async generator</em>.</p>

<p>It's not 100% clear if the functions were given or only the first one.
Many of them would be better inlined.</p>

<p>It's one big static main method that works only on data from System.in. Start by refactoring the algorithm into a reusable utility method that works with integers. You're working with numbers so requiring the input to be a string is not an improvement (it seems like a cop-out to make the coding easier for you).</p>

<p>An armstrong number can not be larger than 4 * 9^3 so you should add range checks to avoid useless checking.</p>

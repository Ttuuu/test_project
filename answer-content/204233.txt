<p>Why should your <code>Cell</code> check against <code>MAX_VALUE</code> anyway? Do you expect some solver to set a value of <code>42</code> in a 9x9 Sudoku? So leave this constant to the <code>Sudoku</code> class. If you want to init a cell simply pass a list of allowed values (you could do a 9x9 Sudoku also with the values <code>'abcdefghi'</code> as there is no math but symbols only). Also get rid of <code>value</code> but have <code>_possible_values</code> reduced to length of 1. Init all cells with a list of symbols and init the non-editable cells with a list of length 1. next get rid of <code>editable</code>, it is not needed any more. also a cell should not need to know it's position in the grid, get rid of it. That leaves a <code>Cell</code> as a container for possibilities.</p>

<p>Another point - do not raise wrong exception types. An <code>AttributeError</code> is expected to be one. Use <code>ValueError</code> and/or <code>IndexError</code> or similar.</p>

<p>Also <code>Region</code> should get a list of possible symbols to work with. By reading the code I could not figure out, what <code>remove_possible_value_if_cell_is_in_region</code>does, that could not be done by <code>update_possible_values</code>. setting a value is nothing different than removing all but one possibility. removing one possibility should be handled the same, whether the count goes down to 5 or to 1.</p>

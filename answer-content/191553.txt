<p>A few superficial things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Games like this are perfect for <strong>object oriented</strong> code. Some obvious classes for a Minesweeper game would include for example <code>Game</code>, <code>Board</code> and <code>Tile</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid <code>global</code>s.</strong> These helpfully often disappear naturally when using OO.</li>
<li><strong>Pass the code through <code>pycodestyle</code></strong> and correct everything it reports. Other Pythonistas will thank you, even though it may feel unfamiliar and even arbitrary some times.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid single letter names</strong> such as <code>b</code>. Even <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> can be misleading in your specific case - a mathematically inclined person would think of them as offsets from the bottom left, but it looks like in your case it's actually an offset from the <em>top</em> left since they are used as <code>row</code> and <code>column</code> in <code>prepareWindow</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Use constants for magic values</strong> such as configuration variables and the minimum number of mines (5).</li>
<li><strong>Add spacing to your <code>longvariablenames</code></strong> to make them easier to read.</li>
</ul>

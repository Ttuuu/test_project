<p>These two functions look quite sufficient to solve the task. I will say that the functional solution will likely be slower, not only because it is functional but also because of the call to <code>.flat()</code> and iterating over twice as many elements. </p>

<p>Correct me if this is incorrect, but the call to <code>.flat()</code> could be removed if the call to <code>.every()</code> was changed to a condition similar to the condition in the imperative solution: </p>

<pre><code>.every((x,i, src) =&gt; i === 0 || !(src[i][0] &lt; src[i - 1][1]));
</code></pre>

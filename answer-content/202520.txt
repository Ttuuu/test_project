<p>One of the improvements would be to use an <code>HttpClient</code> instead of <code>Http</code> for making the API calls.</p>

<p>If you use <code>HttpClient</code>, you won't have to call the <code>res.json()</code> everytime you <code>subscribe</code> to the response.</p>

<p>To use <code>HttpClient</code>, you'll first have to <code>import HttpClientModule from @angular/common/http</code>. Then you'll have to add it to the <code>imports</code> array of your <code>@NgModule</code> decorator.</p>

<p>Then you can inject <code>HttpClient</code> as a dependency and you will have access to the usual Http methods on the instance of <code>HttpClient</code> as well.</p>

<p>With that, you first part of the code will be reduced to:</p>

<pre><code>private itemUrl = "http://fooserver/api/get/item/details";
getItemDetailsUrl(productId): Observable &lt; any &gt; {
  return this.http
    .get(this.itemUrl, {
      params: {
        productId: productId
      }
    })
    .flatMap(res =&gt; this.getItemDetails(res.itemUrl));
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also, I figured, there was a redundant <code>map</code> operation after the flatMap which wasn't really required. Rest all, I guess is in place in your code and I'm not really if it can be improved further. But I'll be looking out for answers to this question just in case.</p>

<p>A comment on the actual game logic rather than coding style: It looks like it's possible the cave might not be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory)" rel="noreferrer">connected</a>, meaning there would be no way for the player to ever reach the wumpus.</p>

<p>Generating a random but connected graph is a bit tricky, but there are various things you could try.</p>

<p>I think many traditional implementations always have 12 rooms, with the structure of the rooms and edges matching the corners and edges of a dodecahedron. The room numbers can be shuffled so that exploration is still tricky no matter how well a player knows the game.</p>

<p>You could first add rooms one by one with an initial connection to some previous random room, forming a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)" rel="noreferrer">tree</a> graph. Then add more random connections like your current cave-building. This might still cause caves where, for example, two different sections are somewhat easy to get around but only two paths connect between them. But that doesn't sound terrible as long as the total size is reasonable.</p>

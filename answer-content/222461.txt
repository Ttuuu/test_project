<p>Instead of embedding the word list within the program, you might want to treat it as <em>configuration</em>, and load it from a data file.  The advantage of this is that it can allow the use of alternative configurations by command-line option (e.g. use a list of French obscenities for French-language lyrics).</p>

<p>On efficiency: we're only interested in the <em>set</em> of words in the lyrics.  Given that many songs have repeated lyrics, then it's probably worth reducing the lyrics to a set of words before comparing that set with the banned words (use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#frozenset.intersection" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>&amp;</code></a> for set intersection), or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#frozenset.isdisjoint" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>set.isdisjoint()</code></a> for a potentially faster test.</p>

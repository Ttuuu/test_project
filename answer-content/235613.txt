<p>The only numbers one should use in coding are 0, 1, and many.</p>

<p>This code implicitly uses 2, the number of special cases, "[]" and "()", for which you wrote code. So right away you know the fundamental design is wrong.</p>

<p>If this were a real program and next week your boss told you to handle "&lt;&gt;" as well, you'd have to write another section of code.  Then next year you're asked to handle "«»" too.  If it had been written properly, each time you'd only have to add those characters to a table and not make any changes to the actual code.  As it is, you'll have to make extensive changes to the code, especially if you've already corrected it to check for proper nesting (e.g. "[(])" is wrong).</p>

<p>The key to writing this is keeping track of what state your string is in at any point: which bracket type is it immediately within.  Hint: try stacking the opening characters as you encounter them.</p>

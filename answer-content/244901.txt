<p>The first things that strike me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where is the documentation?</li>
<li>How do I know what the code is <em>intended</em> to do (which may be different from what it does)?</li>
<li>Why are there no comments at all in/near the code?</li>
</ul>
<p>As such, the code is not maintainable, neither by you in 6 months or some poor maintenance programmer who gets to fix/update the program.  (Always program assuming the maintenance programmer who will have to keep your code alive is a homicidal maniac with a chainsaw and knows where you live.)</p>
<p><em>Given a number i, this will return an array of i elements.  The elements are strings that, when printed/displayed with a monospaced font, will show a triangle. With an input of 3, an array containing these 3 elements is returned:</em></p>
<pre><code>'  *  '
' *** '
'*****' 
</code></pre>
<p>There are also no tests, but that may be justified if it is just an example.  (Input validation etc. etc. etc. have been mentioned by others.)</p>
<p>Unless there is a really, really good reason, you need your code to be (in this order):</p>
<ol>
<li>correct: getting the wrong answers makes the code utterly useless.</li>
<li>maintainable: a new programmer (or you in 6 months) must understand this.</li>
<li>sufficiently fast while not being an undue burden on memory, I/O, storage space etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>Why is speed/memory/... not placed higher?  Because usually these limitations can be solved by throwing money at it, whereas a non-maintainable program is a millstone round the neck.</p>
<p>LoC is a <em>terrible</em> measurement.<br>

(See how productive I have been?)</p>
<p>Elegant code is maintainable: succinct, minimum boilerplate code, idiomatic use of the language.</p>
<p>There are code formatters for C# out there: use them!  Tweak then to fit the style guide used --- if necessary create a style guide.</p>
<p>Consistency is especially important when there are/will be more than one single programmer.</p>
<p>Your choice of name is ... <em>interesting</em>.  Nothing is actually printed.  Even when the result is printed, you will get no stairs.  It'll be a triangle, a pyramid, maybe even a "tower".  Good names provide a very useful abstractions.</p>

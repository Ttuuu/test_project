<p>Is a good practice to share LiveData?
<strong>Yeah</strong></p>

<p>Here as you are using the data in databridge as a single source of truth and it is used hold data which is needed to be shared across multiple screen with live updates, Livedata is a really good option as it will also handle the lifecycle for you.</p>

<p>Android docs also has sample on <a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Extending LiveData</a> to create your own singleton data source which you may find helpful.</p>

<p>Also you can leverage the feature of <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/object-declarations.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Object declarations</a> in kotlin to lazy initialize your DataBridge rather than in Application class.</p>

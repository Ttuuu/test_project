<p>What you've implemented is very similar to the <a href="http://www.dofactory.com/net/builder-design-pattern" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Builder pattern</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Fluent interface</a>. </p>

<p>In your case however this isn't very useful because it doesn't really add any new functionality, abstractions and also does not make anything simpler. It just delegates all calls to actual underlying objects.</p>

<p>I also support the optinion that this is not the right way and that the object initializer is in this case sufficient.</p>

<p>If you would have introduced any abstractions for the email-client or the email-message then a builder might be a better choice but not this time.</p>

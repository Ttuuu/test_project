<p>From eyeballing it, your code doesn't quite produce the format shown after <code>will return</code> (pairs separated by <code>" "</code> instead of <code>"], ["</code>).<br>
An alternative to building a <code>String</code> and then printing it is printing its parts immediately -<br>
I'd define a method like <code>long squares(Appendable destination)</code>:<br>
works with both <code>StringBuilder</code> and <code>OutputStream</code>. (Returning the count of pairs.)</p>

<hr>

<p>Just a sketch how to reduce run time machine operations:  </p>

<ul>
<li>determine <code>max</code> as the maximum input value (terminate with no pairs if negative), and maxRoot = floor(sqrt(<code>max</code>+1))</li>
<li>establish the count of every number from -maxRoot to maxRoot<br>
(<strong><em>assuming</em></strong> [5, 25] was to be reported six times if another five was in the example input -<br>
specifying required output by example is hard, by <em>a single</em> example sub-optimal)</li>
<li>for every non-negative input number that has integer roots in the input, report as many pairs for each of its roots as there are occurrences of that root<br>
(<strong><em>assuming</em></strong> the order didn't matter between, say, <code>[2,4]</code> and <code>[-2,4]</code>. 
If that mattered, too, you'd need to keep positions instead of counts (order on first lookup as a root), increasing <em>additional space</em> to O(n))</li>
</ul>

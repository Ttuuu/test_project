<p><code>draw_position_x</code> and <code>draw_position_o</code> do two things currently - they add a move to the board and they draw it. You should separate those into two functions, one to add a move and one to draw the board, because drawing the board doesn't depend on the move that was just played. A separate draw function won't need any if statements, eliminating a lot of the duplication currently in the code.</p>

<p>You do also do not need a separate functions for placing an 'x' move and placing an 'o' move; use a single function and pass the move 'x' or 'o' as a parameter.</p>

<pre><code>while running:
    while num_moves &lt; 9 and not win:
</code></pre>

<p>You should be able to eliminate one of these two <code>while</code> statements. You can have a single <code>while num_moves &lt; 9 and not win</code> which is sufficient to keep execution in the main game loop until the game is over, and remove all the <code>break</code> statements within the loop. If you need or want to jump back to the top of the loop (for this program, perhaps after bad input) you can use <code>continue</code> instead of <code>break</code>.</p>

<p>The three <code>VERTICAL</code> cases and three <code>HORIZONTAL</code> cases in <code>win_check</code> could be tested with a for loop over columns/rows, instead of repetition.</p>

<p>You don't need to <code>sys.exit()</code> at the end of the program â€” the program exits when it reaches the end of the code.</p>

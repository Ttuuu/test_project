<p>The code feedback is already done wonderfully. I'd like to write about some pointers that might be important, apart from the leet speak:</p>

<ul>
<li>The word Phoque , is French for seal. There are numerous examples of words which are perfectly meaningful in some language but if pronounced in English, might be considered offensive. You might need to do a <a href="https://stackabuse.com/phonetic-similarity-of-words-a-vectorized-approach-in-python/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">phonetic similarity check</a></li>
<li>The context can be taken into account. For example, the word 'blow' or 'mom' need not be offensive. It becomes offensive only when it is surrounded by contextual words that make it offensive, ('job', etc).  In these cases, you might need to come up with an <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-score-probability-predictions-in-python/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">algorithm that outputs a probability score</a> and filter songs based on that.  </li>
</ul>

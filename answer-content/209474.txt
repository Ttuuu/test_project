<p>Obviously. Don't clutter your code with comments unless they add something we don't already know.</p>

<pre><code># defining variables
create_username = 0
create_password = 0
password = 0
username = 0
</code></pre>

<p>This is generally a bad idea, and you aren't in mid-1990s C. Don't predeclare your variables. Initialize them where they're actually used.</p>

<pre><code>print(users)
</code></pre>

<p>If <code>users</code> is a plain-old dictionary, I recommend the use of <code>pprint</code> instead of <code>print</code>.</p>

<pre><code>"enter username(type signup to create an account): "
</code></pre>

<p>This is called in-band control, and is a bad idea. What if someone's username is called "signup"? You want out-of-band control. Ask explicitly whether the user wants to sign up or log in.</p>

<pre><code>if username == "signup" or username == "Signup":
</code></pre>

<p>Don't do two comparisons. Convert <code>username</code> to lowercase and compare with <code>'signup'</code>.</p>

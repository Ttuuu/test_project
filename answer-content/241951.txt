<p>You could change to ExecuteScalar function if you only expect one record. The difference between your code and mine would be in case there are more than one records you take the last record and this code takes the first record.<br>
I also removed the "end if" statement as I don't know what it was for.<br>
Mind that I also changed the select statement to only return the balance as you are not using the name and employee id:  </p>

<pre><code>Public Sub GET_BALANCE_VALUE(EMPLOYEE_ID As Integer, EMPLOYEE_NAME As String, ByRef BALANCE As Integer)
    Dim con As New MySqlConnection("server=localhost; user=rrrr; password=dddd; database=airtech_db; convert zero datetime=true;")
    Dim dt As New DataTable
    Dim da As New MySqlDataAdapter
    Dim sql As String
    Dim DR As MySqlDataReader
    Dim DB_BAL_RETRIVAL As Integer
    Dim cmd As New MySqlCommand

'TO GET PREVIOUS BALANCE - only selects column BALANCE.
SQL_CMD_TXT = "SELECT BALANCE FROM `employees`" &amp; " WHERE `NAME`= '" &amp;
UCase(EMPLOYEE_NAME) &amp; "' AND `EMPLOYEE_ID`= '" &amp;
EMPLOYEE_ID &amp; "';"
Try
    con.Open()
    sql = SQL_CMD_TXT
    cmd = New MySqlCommand(sql, con)
    DB_BAL_RETRIVAL = (integer)cmd.ExecuteScalar() ' returns  null if nothing found
    con.Close()
Catch ex As MySqlException
    Dim mbe = MessageBox.Show(ex.Message, "SALARY_HISTORY_MOD Error", MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Error)
End Try

'RETURNING BALANCE VALUE
BALANCE = DB_BAL_RETRIVAL
End Sub`

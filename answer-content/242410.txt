<h2>Indent the Code</h2>

<p>Most computer code is indented, in some languages indentation is used to show the level of complexity of the code, in other languages the code won't work properly unless it is indented.</p>

<h2>Declare the Variables as They are Needed</h2>

<p>The integer variable <code>i</code> can be declared in the for loop and that will limit the scope to just the for loop.</p>

<pre><code>for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
{
    if(arr[i] &gt; num)
    {
        position = i - 1;
        break;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Horizontal Spacing</h2>

<p>To make the code more readable, put spaces between the operators and the operands as shown above in the for loop example. Squashing all the code together makes it very difficult to understand what the code is actually doing.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>

<p>First run the -O3 optimizer during compilation and linking. If the program were more complicated than it is then use a profiling tool such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gprof" rel="nofollow noreferrer">gprof</a>.</p>

<p>Linear searches are known to be a slower way to do things.</p>

<p>I think the position reported is off by one, if I was using this code to do an insertion sort, I wouldn't subtract one from position. </p>

<h2>Shorten the Code.</h2>

<p>There are 2 shorter ways to subtract 1 from position.</p>

<pre><code>    --position;
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>    position -= 1;
</code></pre>

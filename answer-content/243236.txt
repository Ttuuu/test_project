<h2>Unit pedantry</h2>

<p>Technically those are <code>KiB</code> and <code>MiB</code> since they're multiples of 1024 and not 1000.</p>

<h2>Empty arguments</h2>

<p>This was a difficult lesson for me to drill into my head, but in C empty arguments() and <code>(void)</code> arguments are not the same thing, particularly for function declarations. Technically for definitions they are, but I don't like relying on inconsistent rules and recommend that <code>(void)</code> be used uniformly - even though you only have definitions without declarations.
<code>(void)</code> is safer and more explicit. <code>()</code> is closer to meaning "an unspecified number of arguments".</p>

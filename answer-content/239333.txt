<p>One drawback of this implementation is that, when <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> are of different lengths, it works in quadratic time. Consider</p>

<pre class="lang-cpp prettyprint-override"><code>auto attack = "12324252627";
replace_all(attack, "2", "42");
</code></pre>

<p>How many times most characters are copied to only be copied or, even worse, replaced later?</p>

<p>(Coincidentally, when pattern and replacement are of equal lengths this shouldn't be an issue.)</p>

<p>More reasonable would be to give up on in-place modification and return a freshly constructed string, with all the proper replacements done, in linear time.</p>

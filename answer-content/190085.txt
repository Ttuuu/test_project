<p>Just a quick run through with <a href="http://rubberduckvba.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">RubberDuck VBA</a> shows two common issues -</p>

<p>Passing arguments <code>ByRef</code>. You want to pass them <code>ByVal</code> if at all possible, and it's possible on these.</p>

<p>And not qualifying explicit references. When you refer to <code>Sheet</code> or <code>Range</code> or <code>Cell</code> it is assuming <code>ActiveSheet</code> unless you tell it otherwise. Always tell it where to look.</p>

<p>If this code here -</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>totalRow = Range("A1").End(xlDown).Row
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Is getting the last row, there is a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/11169920/1161309">standard</a> way to find lastRow and lastColumn. That post explains why.</p>

<p>You also have a lot of comments. Do you really need those? If so, why? Comments - <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/code-tells-you-how-comments-tell-you-why/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">"code tell you how, comments tell you why"</a>. The code should speak for itself, if it needs a comment, it might need to be made more clear. If not, the comment should describe <em>why</em> you're doing something rather than <em>how</em> you're doing it. Here are a <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/254979/125931">few reasons</a> to avoid comments all together.</p>

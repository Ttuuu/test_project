<p>Since you asked for <code>pandas</code>, here is one way to do it:</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

df = pd.read_csv("results.csv", encoding='UTF-8',
                 skipinitialspace=True, escapechar='\\')
# convert the times to timedeltas right away
df["Time"] = pd.to_timedelta(df["Time"])
# if it is not already sorted, do so
df = df.sort_values("Time")
# we are going to need this mask to distinguish between category A and the others
category_A = df["Category"] == "A"
# calculate the cutoff time, after which people get 0 points
cutoff = df.loc[category_A, "Time"].min().total_seconds() * 1.15
# calculate the points for all runners (however you do that)
df["Points"] = calculate_points(df)
# set the points to 0 for all runners in category A which are above the cutoff time
df.loc[category_A &amp; (df["Time"].dt.total_seconds() &gt; cutoff), "Points"] = 0
# save to new file
df.to_csv("output.csv")
print(df)

#   Category  Position           Name            Time  Team  avg_power  20minWKG  Male?  20minpower  Points

# 1        A         2  James Johnson 00:41:58.990000  2740        281       4.5      1      283.95   100.0

# 2        A         3       Tom Lamb 00:51:59.250000  1634        311       4.2      1      315.00     0.0
</code></pre>
<p>Note that I modified the time of "Tom Lamb" so that there is actually a runner which is affected by the time cut</p>
<hr>
<p>This is not the nicest code. It could be improved if this cut was done in each category, compared to the fastest person in that category, or, potentially, if you showed the point calculation.</p>

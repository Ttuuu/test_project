<p>This looks like <code>switch (difficulty)</code> might be more appropriate - perhaps with a <code>default</code> branch to catch out-of-range values.</p>

<p>Or, more simply, since we're just picking values, and <code>min</code> is always 0, just select from an array values (after verifying that the user's choice is in range):</p>

<pre><code>int max[] = { 25, 50, 75, 100 };
</code></pre>

<p>In fact, with these values, we could simply multiply:</p>

<pre><code>int max = 25 * difficulty;
</code></pre>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>scanf("%i", &amp;difficulty);
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Don't just discard the result from <code>scanf()</code> - always test that it converted as many values as you wanted.  In this case,</p>

<pre><code>if (scanf("%i", &amp;difficulty) != 1) {
    fputs("Enter a number!\n", stderr);
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);  /* or some better handling */
}
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly here:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>    scanf("%i", &amp;guess);
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, it would be polite to allow users to exit the game when they get bored of it (I know, I can't quite believe that might happen, either!).</p>

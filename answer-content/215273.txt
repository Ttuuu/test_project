<p>So what it looks like your doing is going through a list of <code>Controls</code> inside of <code>groupBox1</code> and trying to figure out what they are and if they are one of you random buttons. You're doing this by naming all the buttons the same but adding there number to the end and then searching them by going through each controller in the <code>groupBox1</code> and checking their name agents the ones you have generated.</p>

<p>There is a way to speed this up a bunch by using a List instead of every time you need to find the correct item looping through <code>groupBox1</code> and checking ever name.
You have already created a list but you filled it with newly created buttons that you actual never used. I would suggest just looping through the <code>groupBox1</code> and adding all the Controls to the list.</p>

<p>Here is a example. (Note if <code>groupBox1</code> has more than just buttons you might want to check its type to make sure it is a button and not something else)</p>

<pre><code>//Creates and populates listButton with all button controls
List&lt;Control&gt; listButtons = new List&lt;Control&gt;();
foreach (Control item in groupBox1.Controls)
    listButtons.Add(item);
</code></pre>

<p>Now you have all the buttons in a list (hopefully in order (I don't know how you setup groupBox1)) and we can start doing the changes you wanted.</p>

<p>Next we want to set all buttons to Green and then we can change the color of the once we want. You are already doing this with the <code>//set forecolor of the not selected buttons to green</code> But we are just going to change it to now work with <code>listButtons</code>. Also if you want to optimize this more just set the buttons colors to green when you create them in <code>groupBox1</code> Unfortunately, I cannot see were you created this group so I cannot help with that</p>

<pre><code>foreach (Control item in listButtons)
{
    item.ForeColor = Color.Green;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Next we want to create a for loop for every time you want you had a random number.
and then inside the for loop we want to create this new random number. Now we want to use that random number to access that button from the list and change its color to orange. And to change the red buttons Red.</p>

<pre><code>Random rnd = new Random();

for (int i = 1; i &lt;= 4; i ++)
{
    int listLength = listButtons.Count - 1;
    int randomNumber = rnd.Next(listLength);

    int minOrange1 = randomNumber - orange1;
    int plusOrange1 = randomNumber + orange1;

    int minOrange2 = randomNumber - orange2;
    int plusOrange2 = randomNumber + orange2;

    //Sets the red random buttons red
    listButtons[randomNumber].ForeColor = Color.Red;
    //Sets all the orange random buttons orange
    if (listLength &lt;= minOrange1 &amp;&amp; minOrange1 &gt;= 0)
        listButtons[minOrange1].ForeColor = Color.Orange;
    if (listLength &lt;= plusOrange1 &amp;&amp; plusOrange1 &gt;= 0)
        listButtons[plusOrange1].ForeColor = Color.Orange;
    if (listLength &lt;= minOrange2 &amp;&amp; minOrange2 &gt;= 0)
        listButtons[minOrange2].ForeColor = Color.Orange;
    if (listLength &lt;= plusOrange2 &amp;&amp; plusOrange2 &gt;= 0)
        listButtons[plusOrange2].ForeColor = Color.Orange;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now if we put it all together the new <code>ShuffleMines()</code> should look something like this (Note you might have to make some tweaks to get it to work within your game. Let me know if you need help or if the code just won't build because of a error I made)</p>

<p><strong>Make sure you added all the buttons in order in <code>groupBox1</code></strong> </p>

<pre><code>public void ShuffleMines()
{
    //Creates and populates listButton with all button controls
    List&lt;Control&gt; listButtons = new List&lt;Control&gt;();
    foreach (Control item in groupBox1.Controls)
        listButtons.Add(item);

    foreach (Control item in listButtons)
        item.ForeColor = Color.Green;

    Random rnd = new Random();

    //Loops for all 4 random sets of buttons
    for (int i = 1; i &lt;= 4; i++)
    {
        int listLength = listButtons.Count - 1;
        int randomNumber = rnd.Next(listLength);

        int minOrange1 = randomNumber - orange1;
        int plusOrange1 = randomNumber + orange1;

        int minOrange2 = randomNumber - orange2;
        int plusOrange2 = randomNumber + orange2;



        //Sets the red random buttons red
        listButtons[randomNumber].ForeColor = Color.Red;
        //Sets all the orange random buttons orange
        if (listLength &gt;= minOrange1 &amp;&amp; minOrange1 &gt;= 0)
            listButtons[minOrange1].ForeColor = Color.Orange;
        if (listLength &gt;= plusOrange1 &amp;&amp; plusOrange1 &gt;= 0)
            listButtons[plusOrange1].ForeColor = Color.Orange;
        if (listLength &gt;= minOrange2 &amp;&amp; minOrange2 &gt;= 0)
            listButtons[minOrange2].ForeColor = Color.Orange;
        if (listLength &gt;= plusOrange2 &amp;&amp; plusOrange2 &gt;= 0)
            listButtons[plusOrange2].ForeColor = Color.Orange;
    }

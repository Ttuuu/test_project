<p>Any code should be readable as we read code 90% time in our overall dealing of code, this code doesn't seem very readable, this can be reviewed better after making some basic changes and after that, it can be review to find real problems or can be refactored.</p>

<ol>
<li>Proper naming like <code>TagCount</code> is not actually a count similarly <code>Validation</code> is not just validation it is validations applicable on tag</li>
<li>Once your naming is proper no need this much of comments, your code should be self explainable, unnecessary comments are noise</li>
<li>Functions should be small and composite</li>
<li>Reducer is not a pure function</li>
<li>lot of functions created inside other functions these can be put out as an independent method for readability</li>
</ol>

<p>Simple things you can improve:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>12</code> is a magic number in your code, you can move it to a constant.</li>
<li>I think <code>TURNS.times do |turn| ...</code> is better than the while loop because you don't have to keep track of the counter.</li>
<li>When you're passing a simple space (<code>" "</code>) to the method <code>split</code> you can just call <code>split</code> instead, without passing any argument.</li>
<li>When the block has multiple lines it is a good practice to use <code>do</code> and <code>end</code> instead of brackets.</li>
<li>I think you can use the <code>select</code> method and assign the result directly to the <code>correct_colors</code> variable.</li>
<li>I think it would be better to call <code>Game.new.start_game</code> instead of <code>Game.new</code>, for me, it isn't intuitive that the game will begin just by instantiating the <code>Game</code> class.</li>
<li>You can make some methods private because you are not calling them on the instance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>File sizes</h2>

<p>1,048,576 bytes are one <code>MiB</code>. 1,000,000 bytes are one <code>MB</code>. 1,024,000 bytes are not anything at all. You should choose the first or second one; the first one goes up in factors of 1,024.</p>

<h2>Bug</h2>

<p>What happens when you pass <code>315</code> to <code>get_file_size</code>? <code>totalsize</code> will not be set.</p>

<h2>Iteration and recursion</h2>

<p>Have a read through this:</p>

<p>which has some great suggestions. Your recursive solution is not the end of the world, but the class implementation is problematic. You've made a class but have not instantiated it, and are passing the string <code>'self'</code> into the <code>self</code> parameter, which is not how this should work. At the absolute least, you should be instantiating <code>FileSizeFinder</code> and then calling the two methods on that instance. Better: define the methods to be <code>@staticmethod</code> so that <code>self</code> is not necessary. Much better: do not use a class at all, and simply have your two functions.</p>

<p>It sounds strange that your usual arithmetic operators are <code>assoc&lt;right&gt;</code>. For example I would expect that <code>9kg - 3kg - 1kg</code> would result in <code>5kg</code>, but your code looks like it would produce <code>9kg - (3kg - 1kg)</code>, which results in <code>7kg</code>.</p>

<p>There's a typo: <code>namo</code> should be <code>nano</code>.</p>

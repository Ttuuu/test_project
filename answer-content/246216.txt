<p>It looks like you'd benefit from moving duplicated logic into functions. Additionally, you manage all of your state within the <code>checker()</code> method, when this state could be stored on the <code>Game</code> object. Passing a user guess into the constructor seems really strange. There's nothing special about the first guess, so don't treat it as a special case.</p>
<pre><code>class Game:
    def __init__(self, secret_word):

        # the user_guess is the the letter that the user/player inputs first

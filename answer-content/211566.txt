<p>As BCdotWEB mentioned in the comment, the prefered way is to consolidate your data model to avoid such hacks. If that is not possible, your solution with the <code>convert_string</code> should work. If you need a more efficient solution, you could use <a href="https://oracle-base.com/articles/8i/function-based-indexes" rel="nofollow noreferrer">function-based-indexes</a> or <a href="https://oracle-base.com/articles/11g/virtual-columns-11gr1" rel="nofollow noreferrer">virtual columns</a> with indices, which should significantly increase query performance.</p>

<p>One comment to the posted code: The oracle function as well as the c# method do not check the length of the string before accessing the 6'th element which may result in an index out of range exception.</p>

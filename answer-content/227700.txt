<p>Are you getting the correct output with the recommended complexity? It's been a long time since I've written my own sort but start by confirming that before any of my recommendations below.</p>

<p>I suspect <code>str.split(" ")</code> is causing problems for you because you're creating lots of strings which you're about to parse and then throw away. How about parsing the integers directly from <code>str</code> in a single pass instead?</p>

<p>Try changing <code>sb.append(currentMinValue + " ")</code> to <code>sb.append(currentMinValue).append(" ")</code>. It might be a small optimization but it's easy to do.</p>

<p>How about splitting your <code>main</code> into two methods? The first for everything that uses <code>reader</code>, the second for everything that uses <code>sb</code>. Besides improving the structure of the program this provides a natural point for garbage collection.</p>

<p>What command-line args are you giving to the JVM? Since you know your memory limit try allocating it all at the start to save time allocating more memory later. You might also play with different garbage collection strategies. As you're discovering, forcing garbage collection isn't a good idea. If you're correctly setting the maximum in the JVM it should automatically garbage collect as needed to prevent running out of memory.</p>

<p>Hope at least one of these suggestions helps. I'm curious what gives the biggest improvement.</p>

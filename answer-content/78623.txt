<p>Great job on this! You did many things right. You made you variable names the same across all functions, told what each input was, and (mostly) was uncluttered.</p>

<p>These are just some minor fixes.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Change <code>jug2_result, jug1_result = 2, 0</code> to <code>jug1_result, jug2_result = 2, 0</code> to keep in line with the rest of the declarations.</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of <code>"{}".format(value1)</code>, I like to use <code>"%s" %(value1)</code>. Just personal preference, and it's shorter.</p></li>
<li><p>What's with</p>

<pre><code>vertex = g.vertices[finish]
while vertex.predecessor is not None:
    path.append(vertex)
vertex = vertex.predecessor
path.append(vertex)
return reversed(path)
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>You reverse <code>path</code> with your loop, then return it reversed again? No! Just iterate through g.vertices.</p>

<p>Again, most of these are minor, and this is probably not the best answer. Happy coding!</p>

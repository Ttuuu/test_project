<p>In order of appearance:</p>

<ol>
<li>Despite of what your given tool says, don't use its naming convention if you can avoid it. What are <em>jdbcTemplate</em> and <em>archivalJdbcTemplate</em> actually? You said they were datasources (and they are kind of that, just an access wrapper of it), why don't you call it like that (<em>smsDatasource</em> and <em>archiveSmsDatasource</em>)?</li>
<li><strong>In the method of <em>determineDataSource</em>, you are not returning your datasource, you are returning a list of items as the result of a query you have run on that datasource</strong>. You need to change the method name or the logic within the method. I'd just create a method with name <em>getDataSource()</em> to choose the right <em>NamedParameterJdbcTemplate</em> to be used. Then, what you have left in your old method has almost the same functionality than <em>NamedParameterJdbcTemplate.query()</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Try to avoid using acronyms or abbreviations</strong>. A few examples of this would be: what is <em>custId</em>? what is <em>rtDto</em>? what is <em>mtn</em>?... In the old days, fellow programmers didn't have IDE's that autocomplete the stuff you half-typed, neither they had wide screens... They have <em>real</em> limitations that we no longer have and we can now write descriptive yet concise stories in our sourcecode.</li>
<li>It looks like you have some written queries as instance fields, but the names are not descriptive enough, so I cannot know what those queries are doing, and that is deceptive and dangerous. </li>

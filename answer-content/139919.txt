<h3>Namespaces</h3>

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/1452721/1014587"><code>using namespace std;</code> is considered bad practice</a>. Short code is not a requirement in C++, clear code is preferred. It's a thing commonly taught to new C++ programmers because it's 'easier', but it will royally bite you in the behind when conflicts arise.</p>

<h3>Return</h3>

<p><code>return 0;</code> is a legacy from (pre-C99) C. In C++, it's no longer required to write this manually at the end of <code>main</code>. The compiler will take care of returning 'normal' if no errors were thrown or other returns (like <code>-1</code>) are encountered.</p>

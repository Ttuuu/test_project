<p><code>throws</code> in method declaration means that this method throws that exceptions, but does not handle them by itself. </p>

<p>If a method may throw an exception that it does not handle, it must specify this so that callers can handle that exception. </p>

<p>This is necessary for all exceptions, except <code>Error</code> or <code>RuntimeException</code>, or any of their derivatives. All other exceptions must be declared in the <code>throws</code> clause. If they are not, a compile-time error will (or may, I'm not sure) be generated.</p>

<p>Bottom line, if you try to throw non-listed exception, compiler will not compile. If you list all necessary exceptions, users of the class will be forced to use <code>try catch</code> blocks.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A call to <code>strlen(compress)</code> is unnecessary. You already know the length of the compressed string; it is <code>j</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>You may (in fact, you should) terminate the loop as soon as <code>j</code> reaches the length of the original. Once it happened, the compressed string will for sure be longer than original.</p></li>
<li><p><code>nc + '0'</code> assumes that <code>nc</code> is a single digit. The problem statement doesn't say anything about that.</p></li>
<li><p>The size of <code>buffer[20]</code> is pretty arbitrary. Since the function provides guarantees about the size of the compressed string, consider allocating <code>strlen(original)</code> bytes for <code>compressed</code>.</p></li>

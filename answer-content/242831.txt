<h2>Tests</h2>

<p>You've written some - great! Keep that up. If you want to add more structure, consider Python's <code>unittest</code> library.</p>

<h2>Unused globals</h2>

<p><code>BET_OUTCOMES</code>, <code>SUPPORTED_BET_TYPES</code> and <code>SIDES</code> are not used. My assumption is that this is related to the other segment of your code that you deleted. If it stays deleted, then delete these, too.</p>

<p>Similarly, this docstring:</p>

<pre><code>'''Returns the appropriate outcome of the bet from BET_OUTCOMES'''
</code></pre>

<p>is now incorrect.</p>

<h2>Stringly-typed variables</h2>

<p><code>bet_type</code> being either <code>total</code> or <code>handicap</code> should not be represented as a string. It should be represented as an <code>Enum</code>, or maybe if there will remain only two states, a boolean such as <code>is_handicap_bet</code>. The same applies to <code>outcome</code>.</p>

<h2>Negation</h2>

<p><code>bet_amount * -1</code> should be <code>-bet_amount</code>. 
<code>bet_amount * (-1 / 2)</code> should be <code>-bet_amount / 2</code>.</p>

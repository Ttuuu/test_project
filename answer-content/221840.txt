<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>It's invalid HTML to have <code>h1</code> inside <code>span</code>.</p>

<p>Don't use IDs for general styling use classes instead (see for example <a href="https://dev.to/claireparkerjones/reasons-not-to-use-ids-in-css-4ni4" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://dev.to/claireparkerjones/reasons-not-to-use-ids-in-css-4ni4</a>).</p>

<p>Regarding the HTML structure it seems to make sense to have the title inside the <code>.page</code> element.</p>

<p>Many of the used id and class names are very generic. Considering this is a login page I would at the very least expect the word "login" to be used somewhere. Have a look at some CSS naming schemes, for example BEM.</p>

<p>It seems to me to be a bad idea to use <code>font-size: 0</code> to hide elements. Why not use <code>display: none</code>?</p>

<p>The layout breaks for small browser windows heights.</p>

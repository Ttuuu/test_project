<p>After some experimentation, the issue does not appear to be your code.</p>

<p>In fact, if you copy the MD5 implementation from the other crate into your crate that copy will still run slower than the version in the other crate. Instead, it runs about the same speed as your code.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what's going on, but it probably has to do with the limitations of optimizations crossing a crate boundary. Probably, some optimization that the rust compiler thinks is a good idea actually degrades performance and this optimization happens to not be possible if the code is split into two crates.</p>

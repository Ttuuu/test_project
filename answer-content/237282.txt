<p>The way you currently doing it would require all the websites to be written manually. A possible alternative would be to implement recursion (loops).</p>

<p>The for loop:</p>

<p>For loops are a good way of repeating a section of code/similar code a number of times.
The number of times to repeat this code can be known explicitly, or you can determine it through a simple calculation.</p>

<p>Syntax:</p>

<pre><code>for($i = 0; $i &lt; 10; $i++) {
    echo "I at at iteration: " . $i . "\r\n";
}
</code></pre>

<p>Meaning:</p>

<pre><code>for(initialisation; condition; increment) {
    Code to Execute
}
</code></pre>

<p>Implementation</p>

<p>As Hardy Mathew provided, a possible implementation could be: <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/237250/218422">https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/237250/218422</a></p>

<p>Other</p>

<p>Your urls look like php classes. If you are trying to include them with other classes, perhaps auto loading is what you're looking for: <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.autoload.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.autoload.php</a></p>

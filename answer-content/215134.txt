<p>Take a look at your code, and think about the spec:</p>

<p>It should be, put all letters in order in a circle, if the input is in position n, the output is in position n + shift.</p>

<p>What you have is quite a lot more complicated, and in no way meets the spec.</p>

<ol>
<li>You should add <code>tempMsg.reserve(str.size());</code> to avoid reallocations.</li>
<li>You should move the line into <code>tempMsg</code> instead of making a spurious copy.</li>
<li>Consider normalising the shift before using it. And why not pre-calculate a lookup-table for use in the transform? Your choice on whether to do it on the fly, or do all 26 possible ones at compile-time.</li>
<li>There isn't actually any advantage to using <code>std::transform</code> instead of a for-range-loop, but anyway the third argument should be <code>lines.begin()</code>.</li>
<li>Your naming is curious: <code>str</code> for all lines, <code>lines</code> for a single line... Also, why not call <code>tempMsg</code> something Shorter but more descriptive like <code>ret</code>?</li>
<li>You might want to reconsider your decision to read the whole file into memory before starting processing. It isn't even useful to read it as separate lines instead of blocks.</li>

<p>Outside of beginners' programming courses and interview quizzes, linked lists are rarely useful. Theoretically, they may be efficient, but in practice, the memory allocation and memory fragmentation just isn't worth it. That may be why Python, which is supposed to come with <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0206/#batteries-included-philosophy" rel="nofollow noreferrer">"batteries included"</a>, does not come with a linked list in its standard library.</p>

<p>For a fixed-size queue, where the oldest entry is to be automatically discarded, a better data structure would be a <a href="/questions/tagged/circular-buffer" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'circular-buffer'" rel="tag">circular-buffer</a>, which in Python is provided by the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>collections.deque</code></a> class. You should make a <code>deque(maxlen=capacity)</code> instead of your <code>LinkedList</code>.</p>

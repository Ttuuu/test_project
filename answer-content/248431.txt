<p>I think I am going to change the interface.</p>
<p>Currently the usage patter is:</p>
<pre><code>typename Sha1::DigestStore      digest;
Sha1                            hasher;

hasher.hash("Bob", digest);
</code></pre>
<p>There does not seem a need to create a <code>Sha1</code> object. I think a better interface may be to make all the methods <code>static</code> so the usage becomes:</p>
<pre><code>typename Sha1::DigestStore      digest;

Sha1::hash("Bob", digest);
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>DigestStore</code> may need some other accesses functions. It currently allows <code>iteration</code> but there can be a use case where we have a <code>const_iterator</code>.</p>
<p>Still trying to understand when best to use <code>string_view</code>. Unfortunately it still does not play well with normal strings. So we may have to provide a way to also extract a string from the buffer. In that case it would be nice if we could have the data from the DigestStore into a string (which means not using <code>std::array</code>) but need to have a good use case to make that work better.</p>
<p>Not sure how that will work yet. Please provide a hint if you have am idea.</p>

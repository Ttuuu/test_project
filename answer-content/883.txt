<p>I would try to count each character and verify that it roughly matches the normal frequency of English letters. It could be more precise (on sufficiently large inputs) than counting the number of letters.</p>

<p>If you sort letters by their number of appearences, you should, statistically speaking, get something like <code>ETAONRISHDLFCMUGYPWBVKXJQZ</code>. You could use the edit distance between this string and the letters sorted by order of appearance to give a rough measurement of entropy.</p>

<p>Also, you could possibly catch non-English posts that way. (If you do go this way, I recommend you exclude code fragments from the count...)</p>

<p>First of all you must understand that <strong>validation and sanitization are not synonyms</strong>. But completely different processes that have very little in common.</p>
<p>Whereas sanitization indeed does prevent the malicious use, validation is merely for your and/or your customer's convenience. A properly sanitized data do not require any validation to be safe.</p>
<h1>Sanitization</h1>
<p>Speaking of the former, there is not so much to sanitize in this form. At least from the list you was able to gather:</p>
<ul>
<li>there is no HTML output, so it makes no sense convert html characters.</li>
<li>empty spaces do no harm whatsoever</li>
<li>stripslashes always has been useless in the business of preventing any malicious use, while nowadays it's absolutely useless at all</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't know what harm could be done to the code like this - may be it's better to ask on the security-related site of the network. May be it would be useful to check the input data length and to validate the email address.</p>
<h1>Validation</h1>
<p>Is another matter. You could validate the email address, so it won't allow a bogus email. Same goes for the date - whether it is correct and could be understood.
But, as it was said before, it's entirely up to you, whether to bother with validation or not.</p>

<p>I'm not a Java developer, but a quick tip I can provide is to avoid comments that don't explain anything. See:</p>

<pre><code>/*
* Player Class
*/
public class Player {
</code></pre>

<p>What's the benefit of this comment? It says exactly the same thing as the following line of code. Also, if at some point you decide that this <code>Player</code> class would better fit under a different name, like <code>Character</code> or <code>Entity</code>, chances are you will forget to change the comment in which case it will straight up lie about the code.</p>

<p>On the subject of lying, this comment already does:</p>

<pre><code>/*
* Bag object instantiation
*/
private Bag b;
</code></pre>

<p>This is not an instantiation of the bag object - it's only a declaration.</p>

<p>I understand that those comments may be helpful from a beginner perspective, before things like the class declaration, constructors, fields etc become idiomatic. Over time you'll find that if you remove comments like these you'll reduce the noise in your code and make it actually easier to follow. Might as well start early.</p>

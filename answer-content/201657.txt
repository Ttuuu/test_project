<p>just a note on syntax error. a syntax error occurs when you have a fault with your writing of python, not with your logic or values. if the lexer goes through your program and finds if x == 3 ::, it will raise a syntax error as it finds an unexpected :. but 3 + 'm' is not of this type as the lexer finds nothing wrong in it.</p>

  <p>Now I would like to know, can it be done in some better way? It contains <strong>13</strong> bytes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From this I conclude that by <em>better</em> you mean <em>shorter</em>.</p>

<p>You can easily bring this down to <strong>11</strong> bytes if you duplicate the method that was used to fill <code>RSI</code> for the setup of <code>RAX</code>.</p>

<pre><code>push 0x3e
pop  rax
dec  rdi
push 0x9
pop  rsi
syscall
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>The instruction <code>dec rdi</code> depends on the existing value of <code>RDI</code>.<br>
If you know that its lowest 32 bits are non-zero, then you can write <code>dec edi</code> instead, and lose the REX.W prefix. ( -&gt; <strong>10</strong> bytes)</p>

<pre><code>push 0x3e
pop  rax
dec  edi
push 0x9
pop  rsi
syscall
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>But the most important improvement you can make is of course writing comments.
For now those numbers 0x3E and 0x09 are just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)" rel="nofollow noreferrer">magic numbers</a>. What do they mean?
That's what everyone that reads your code is interested in knowing.</p>

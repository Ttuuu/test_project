<p>I think the big thing here is to <strong>beware of external data</strong>. Assume that it could be garbage.</p>

<p>For instance:</p>

<ul>
<li>What happens if the user doesn't enter a name? -&gt; Actually, not much apart from 2 spaces (rather than 1) in messages - relatively benign.</li>
<li>What happens if the user enters "rabbit" sides? -&gt; This value in any case needs to be transformed to an int for <code>roll</code> to work correctly otherwise a TypeError will be thrown. <code>int("rabbit")</code> will throw a ValueError (see last item)</li>
<li>Similarly, <code>num_of_dice</code> also have to be validated as a positive integer (non-zero).</li>
<li>If the user enters something wrong for <code>roll_again</code> (say, "of course!"), you'll enter an infinite loop - The question probably needs to be brought inside the loop.</li>
<li>You'll want to use <code>raw_input</code> rather than <code>input</code> in python2. <code>Input</code> evaluates an expression, which does what you want here (enter a number, get an int back (unless of course it's a float!)), but should be regarded as <em>avoid if at all possible</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>PHP is hell of a language to see other people working (abusing) with. </p>

<p>I'll assume the initial goal is to remove line-break elements at the beginning and the end of strings intended for output. </p>

<p>I'd suggest a single-purpose function like: </p>

<pre class="lang-php prettyprint-override"><code>function trimbr($s)
{
    return preg_replace('{^(&lt;br\s*/*&gt;)*|(&lt;br\s*/*&gt;)*$}i', "", $s);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The reason is as follow: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Regex-based string modification runs much much faster than character iterating methods. </p></li>
<li><p>Over-generalizing our trim function may not be as useful as it initially seems to be. </p></li>
<li><p>Since we're restraining ourselves from generalizing, we now aim for a minimal functionality and implementation. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Point 1 and 3 are easy to understand I suppose.</p>

<p>As for 2, we can put some stock regex substrings in the function - these substrings should be commonly-needed, and regex-safe. </p>

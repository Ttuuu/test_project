<p>Just some comments on the last part of the command.</p>
<p>Since you don't use any of the extra features of <code>uniq</code>, you can drop replace</p>
<p><code>sort -nr | uniq</code></p>
<p>with</p>
<p><code>sort -nr -u</code></p>
<hr>
<p>I don't see a reason to sort in reverse, and then take the first line with <code>head -1</code>, when you could instead use <code>tail -1</code>.</p>
<p><code>sort -nu | tail -1</code></p>
<hr>
<p>While outputting duplicated lines to tail might take some time if there is a lot of duplication, since you only actually want the final line, you can probably drop the <code>-u</code> flag in <code>sort</code>. If you wanted the most recent 3 dates, you'd need to add it back in.</p>

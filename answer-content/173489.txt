<p>Here are the few things I've noticed after a first glance on the program:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>import os</code> is not used, you can remove it</li>
<li><code>()</code> after the <code>class Application</code> can be omitted</li>
<li>keep two blank lines between the imports and the class definition, after the class code and the <code>if __name__ == '__main__'</code> line</li>
<li><em>variable naming</em> - there are some poor variable names like <code>x</code> or <code>k</code> - consider renaming them to something more descriptive</li>
<li><p>the following code block can be removed (unless you have it there as a stub for future development):</p>

<pre><code>else:
    return
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>the class itself feels overloaded - this may be because it does two different not-directly related things at the same time - prompting the user and making budget calculations - since you are going to continue to develop the class - make sure <code>Application</code> is not becoming a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_object" rel="noreferrer">God Object</a></p></li>
<li>the class and its methods would benefit from having detailed documentation strings</li>
</ul>

<p>As a side note, take a look at the <a href="http://aosabook.org/en/index.html" rel="noreferrer">The Architecture of Open Source Applications</a> project - it is really pure informational gold in terms of designing, thinking and development of your software project.</p>

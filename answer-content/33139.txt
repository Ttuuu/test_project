<p>I think it looks like good, clear, general purpose code. I don't see any really significant changes to make, but there might be some minor improvements available.</p>

<p>First, allocating default size collections and letting them grow naturally may not work well for large collections. IIRC they start at 10 elements, and then double each time they top out. But each doubling requires a reallocation and a copy, which can add up when you're adding thousands of items. You should initialize them with the proper size if you know what it is. If you can take a decent guess, even that will help: starting at (for example) 200 elements instead of 10 will save you a lot of allocations. But avoid calling <code>Count()</code> on your input <code>IEnumerable</code> objects since that could cause them to be enumerated an extra time, depending on the underlying implementation.</p>

<p>Second, if you commonly have no insertions in <code>remote</code> and no deletions in <code>local</code>, you could add some code to skip the final enumeration of <code>remoteKeyValue</code>. As you're enumerating <code>local</code>, keep a count of how many items were found in <code>remoteKeyValues</code>. If the number you end up with is equal to <code>remoteKeyValues.Count</code> then you know there are no insertions, because you already matched all the items in that collection.</p>

<p>As always with performance tweaking, profile it before and after any changes.</p>

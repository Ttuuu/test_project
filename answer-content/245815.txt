<h2>Localisation</h2>
<p>It's fine to localise your user-facing strings (e.g. <code>print('Die Buchstaben in diesem Wort bilden ein Palindrom')</code>, but it is not advisable to write the code itself in a language other than English. For better or worse, English is the de-facto language of programming. Thus, <code>buchstabe</code> would be better as <code>letter</code>.</p>
<h2>For-loop</h2>
<p>The loop is not necessary:</p>
<pre><code>    name_reversed = name[::-1]
</code></pre>
<p><code>name</code> is a string, which is itself a sequence of one-character strings. Applying a slice, as is done here, reverses the sequence but does not change the type: the output of the expression is still a string.</p>

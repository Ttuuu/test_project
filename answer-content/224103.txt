<h3>General Guidelines</h3>

<ul>
<li>You have coded everything in a single class <code>Program</code>. Take advantage of the fact C# is an object oriented language. Create at least one custom class that defines this problem.</li>
<li>Your current implementation is very strict and specific to 2 types of items. What if Monica needs to buy from <code>n</code> item types? It is up to you to decide the scope of your implementation, so what you have done is not wrong, but it is something to consider when building reusable code blocks. We can argue reusability of this exercise though.</li>
<li>When providing a method for consumers to use, make sure to include a handful of unit tests. This is an excellent way to get to know the outcome given any input. In this case, you are providing us <code>GetMoneySpent</code>, but we have to write our own unit tests to verify correctness of this method.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Review</h3>

<ul>
<li>You are using <code>Array</code> for a problem where <code>IEnumerable</code> could have also been used. Prefer the latter because you don't want to depend on fixed sized collections. You are converting <code>ToArray()</code>, this overhead should not be required when working with <code>IEnumerable</code>.</li>
</ul>

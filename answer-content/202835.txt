<p>Use variable names that are descriptive, so they will help document your code for anyone reading it without needing to add comments.
For example, instead of </p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>bool w = false;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>use</p>

<pre><code>bool HasWon = false;
</code></pre>

<p>which immediately makes clear that this is concerned with the final winning status.  Likewise change "t" to "ValidTries" etc.</p>

<hr>

<p>From a design viewpoint, if you decide the input is invalid, you should be writing a message to the user to tell them why that is invalid, not just giving them the prompt again.</p>

<hr>

<p>Instead of the goto commands and the labels for them, use a <code>while</code> loop or a <code>do... while</code>  for any time something needs to repeat.  Group your two exit conditions (they have won or they have run out of tries) together on the main "keep playing" loop, and then try a <code>do...while</code> loop for looking for a valid try.</p>

<p>So in pseudocode you want something like:</p>

<pre><code>while (not HasWon and ValidTries &lt; 8)

{
    do
    {
        // prompt them to try and read input
        // check validity of input and return error message if there is a problem
    } while (Input is not valid)

    HasWon = //check the answer is correct or not
    if (not HasWon)
    {
       ValidTries ++
       // print message that that try is wrong
     }
}
if (HasWon)
   // print winning message saying how many ValidTries it took
else
   // print message saying they ran out of tries and giving the correct answer
</code></pre>

<p>We don't have the lines of codes you say they are doing the "same" thing. So I should guess.</p>

<p>If those lines of codes have the same logic, just with different data, It's a great idea to separate those lines of codes in another method.</p>

<p>But it seems that those lines just need teams data, not the data that belong to the object. If that is the case, you should separate those lines in a <code>static</code> method, in python words, you need to add <code>@staticmethod</code> at the top of that method before <code>def</code> keyword and you should remove <code>self</code> from parameters.</p>

<p>But it is always a great idea to export the same codes in a separate reusable place. </p>

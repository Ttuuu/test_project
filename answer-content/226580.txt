<p>There are already good reviews, but there are some other points that should be addressed.</p>

<p>You don't need to use global <code>static</code> variables in your case. Your methods should only use local variables because you always reset your variables in your methods, which makes the global variables useless. A method named <code>Get...</code> should always return something, it just makes sense.</p>

<p>Second, it's a bad practice to have boolean variables that represent negative conditions. I mean that it's confusing to have <code>isInvalidInput = false</code> instead of <code>isValidInput = true</code>. It's most of the time clearer to use positive variables. If you used the <code>break</code> keyword, you could skip the use of the <code>isInvalidInput</code> <em>and</em> remove the else in your code. You can also (assuming you're using C#7) use <code>out int width</code> instead of declaring <code>int width</code> then use the <code>out</code> variable. Lastly, the word <code>integer</code> means something to developers, but not that much to non-IT people. If your program is used by non IT people, you should consider rephrasing it.</p>

<p>Final version : </p>

<pre><code>private static int GetDepthInput()
{
    while (true)
    {
        Console.Write("Enter weight of parcel:  ");
        string input = Console.ReadLine();

        if (int.TryParse(input, out int width))
        {
            break;
        }

        Console.WriteLine("***The input is invalid. (Decimal numbers aren't allowed)***");
    }

    return input;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I didn't address the other points that are written in the other 2 reviews but I also think they should be implemented.</p>

<p>OK several years later and looking back I now know what I was doing wrong</p>

<p>this is a misuse of the command parameter</p>

<p>the command parameter is not a variable that you pass into the command on execution to relay the state of the application
its a constant used to specify behaviour.</p>

<p>if your command depends on a variable parameter you should create your own command that declares the variable as a property which can then trigger the correct events that are required to notify the view of the state change</p>

<pre><code>public class ColumnCommand:ICommand,INotifyPropertyChanged
{
    public int ActiveColumn{get;set;}
    //etc;
}
</code></pre>

<p>then you could use the parameter to set if the command performs an add or a remove by passing in the string add or remove as the command parameter as this behaviour will not change during the lifespan of the command binding</p>

<p>this then allows the VM to update itself and work as intended</p>

<p>I'm not going to touch on your question on thread safety as it is a broad topic I am not familiar with. However, I can help with your questions about generics.</p>
<p>Right now, you're using generics great, except in one single place</p>
<pre><code>node.data = 0 as T
</code></pre>
<p>The type of <code>node.data</code> is <code>T</code>. This code will fail if <code>T</code> is not <code>Int</code> - for example, if <code>T</code> is <code>String</code>, the code will look like this:</p>
<pre><code>node.data = 0 as String
</code></pre>
<p>and that will throw a runtime exception.</p>
<p>Here's the important thing, though. There's no reason to do <code>node.data = &lt;anything&gt;</code>.
I assume the reason for having it originally was to "zero out" or get rid of the data as it's removed from the list - but that's what java will do for you automatically!</p>
<p>Let's say you have the following structure</p>
<pre><code>linked list    /--&gt; node 1   /--&gt; value 1
-----------    |    ------   |    --------
first node ---/     data ---/        7
</code></pre>
<p>when you delete the pointer to <code>node 1</code>, you end up in this situation</p>
<pre><code>linked list         node 1   /--&gt; value 1
-----------         ------   |    --------
first node-&gt;null    data ---/        7
</code></pre>
<p>now that there is no reference anywhere to <code>node 1</code>, the jvm garbage collector deletes it</p>
<pre><code>linked list         value 1
-----------         ------
first node-&gt;null        7
</code></pre>
<p>and because there is no reference to <code>value 1</code>, it's also deallocated.</p>
<p>This means that there's no reason to set the data field to anything - and, besides the point, there is no possible value you could set it to that would work for any value of T (in java, though, you could use null)</p>

<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>if word in korean_data.keys():
    return korean_data[word]
</code></pre>

<p>This is better written as:</p>

<pre><code>trans = korean_data.get(word)
if trans:
    return trans
</code></pre>

<p>This:</p>

<pre><code>elif len(get_close_matches(word,korean_data.keys(),n=1,cutoff=.69)) &gt; 0:
    word = get_close_matches(word,korean_data.keys(),n=1,cutoff=.69)[0]
    return korean_data[word]
</code></pre>

<p>calls for a few changes. Firstly, you don't need an <code>elif</code>, simply an <code>if</code> - because the previous block returned. Also, you should avoid re-issuing that entire <code>get_close_matches</code> call, and instead write a temporary variable:</p>

<pre><code>words = get_close_matches(word,korean_data.keys(),n=1,cutoff=.69)
if words:
    return korean_data[words[0]]
</code></pre>

<p>This:</p>

<pre><code>return "Word does not exist."
</code></pre>

<p>is not really good practice. It's "in-band error information", i.e. you're mixing valid data with an error message. Instead, you should be <code>raise</code>-ing an exception, catching it in your calling code, and outputting an error message there.</p>

  <p>What other challenges would you recommend that incorporates both JSON and python?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Download or scrape a real Korean-English dictionary dataset, either incorporating it into your application or setting up a REST client to contact a translation server somewhere. If local, save it as a format more efficient than JSON - perhaps compressed pickle, or SQLite. There are many ways to store a local database, and each has its advantages and disadvantages, but that's a topic for another question.</p>

<p>A few semi-random observations.</p>

<p>You define functions in your header file, so if you include that in multiple source files in one project you'll get multiple definition errors from the linker.  (Also, those functions are using standard library functions without including the required header files.)</p>

<p><code>main</code> makes assumptions about the number of parameters passed to the program.  If you don't pass enough, you'll dereference a NULL or out-of-bounds pointer (e.g., an invalid value for <code>argv[5]</code>).  You should verify that you have enough parameters (by checking <code>argc</code>) before attempting to access any of the parameters.</p>

<p>Rather than the verbose <code>count_lines = count_lines + 1;</code>, you can just use <code>++count_lines;</code>.</p>

<p>Your code for building the split filename is nearly identical in the two places you use it.  You can put it in a function to avoid the duplication, and simplify it by using <code>sprintf</code> to build the entire filename rather than using <code>sprintf</code> and <code>strcat</code>.</p>

<pre><code>sprintf(buf, "splitfile%d.txt", n);
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>buf</code> and <code>n</code> are passed as parameters to the function.  <code>buf</code> should be long enough to hold any value for <code>n</code>, 9 + 4 + 1 + 11 = 25 characters, assuming <code>n</code> is no larger than 32 bits.  (That's 9 bytes for the base filename, 4 for the extension, 1 for the terminating nul, and 11 for a signed 32 bit integer printed as a decimal.)</p>

<p>You don't verify that <code>fw</code> and <code>fr</code> (and some of your other file handles) have successfully been opened before making use of them.</p>

<p>Most of your <code>strdup</code> calls will leak, and are not necessary.</p>

<p>At one point in <code>main</code> you call <code>atoi(&amp;line_copy[0])</code> twice - one inside an <code>if</code>, and once in the following statement.  This should be called once, stored in a local variable:</p>

<pre><code>int nr = atoi(line_copy);
if (nr &gt; NUMBER_OF_ROWS)
    NUMBER_OF_ROWS = nr;
</code></pre>

<p><code>reducerThread</code> will be an infinite loop if <code>SYNCHRONIZED</code> is 0.</p>

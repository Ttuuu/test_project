<p>Just a couple of additional points...</p>

<p>I've not used c++17, but when performing tests against constants, consider putting the constants on the left, rather than the right.  This prevents typos from having unexpected consequences.  <code>if (res = -1)</code> changes the value of <code>res</code>, whereas <code>if(-1 = res)</code> doesn't compile.</p>

<p>You're keeping variables in your class that seem like they aren't needed.  If they're only needed for the constructor, then use local variables.  Maybe you have other plans for it, but <code>res</code> looks particularly suspect, since it's always going to be <code>0</code> if the class has been constructed and in the code you've supplied it's never read again.</p>

<p>This code is obviated by @Peilonrayz, which has posted a good solution. However, in the future, if you need to do something like</p>

<pre><code>PATH = path + '/' if path is not '' else '.'
</code></pre>

<p>you're better off to do</p>

<pre><code>PATH = (path or '.') + '/'
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise, the other suggestion is complete.</p>

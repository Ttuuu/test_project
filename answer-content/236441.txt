<p>Some suggestions:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>Chore</code>'s <code>period</code> field should probably be <code>period_days</code> to avoid the comment.</li>
<li>The comment on <code>update</code> makes it look like it should be called <code>mark_complete</code> or something, so that you can remove the comment. In any case I would expect the <em>view</em> rather than the model to do that update.</li>
<li>It is customary to use a <code>ModelViewSet</code> to encapsulate the sort of functions you have in views.py.</li>
<li><code>Chore.DoesNotExist</code> should result in a HTTP 404 response code, which is the default. No need for custom code. In general, letting DRF decide the response code is much easier.</li>
<li>The test classes have inconsistent naming.</li>
</ol>

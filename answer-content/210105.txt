<p>On a simulator with the original code, it takes about <code>1.52s</code> on my machine. </p>

<p>Since the base image won't get resized (<code>self.size</code> is passed in <code>self.draw(in:)</code>), and its alpha channel is always <code>1</code>, I could gain at least <code>200ms</code> by using the following :</p>

<pre><code>self.draw(at: CGPoint.zero, blendMode: .copy, alpha: 1)
</code></pre>

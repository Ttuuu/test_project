<h3>Bug</h3>
<p>Your program fails on this test:</p>
<pre><code>ls.solve("abddc", "acddb");
</code></pre>
<p>Your program finds <code>"ab"</code> and <code>"ac"</code> as the longest subsequences, but the actual answer should be <code>"add"</code>.</p>
<p>The problem is that your algorithm is greedy, and it will always use any match, even if the match skips over a part that would produce a better answer.  In my test case, the <code>b</code> in the first string matches the <code>b</code> at the end of the second string, thereby  skipping over the <code>dd</code> in the middle.</p>

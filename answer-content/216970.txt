<p>At first sight, your code looks consistent and readable. Congrats!</p>

<p>That said, I'll jump into your questions. The assertions are used correctly. Often you'll see them written as <code>assert(I &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; "Valid index needed");</code> That allows adding a comment to it. Especially useful if the code itself ain't 100% understandable from the callers point of view.</p>

<p>You're preconditions are also a very good example of the contracts extensions of C++20 and make them part of your API instead. For now, I would document them at class level.</p>

<p>Jumping into the assert of the copy constructor, that one is useless as you can't ever trigger it. It does make sense in copy assignment, although, it's better to handle that case and return early.</p>

<p>The implementation of queue looks good to me, it leverages existing methods instead of writing it from scratch. Perfect coding on my side.</p>

<p>You do want to consider initializing the members in the class definition, as it is less error prone.</p>

<p>Adding the allocator is adding an extra template argument and member and replacing all new/delete. </p>

<p>I like the east const, however, adding const to the return value if by value doesn't make much sense. I would remove it.</p>

<p>There are some issues with this solution:</p>

<ol>
<li>You are saying that this class will be used from many threads under a heavy load. In this case a lock in AsyncFile::write is not going to scale well. Only one thread can write logs at a time, depending on the load this kind of thing can bring the whole system down. Though of course with your load pattern it might be just fine.</li>
<li>I agree that the constants should be configurable</li>
<li>fopen is most likely a buffered api. So, if your app crashes, the logs will be corrupted. </li>
<li>There is no overflow mechanism. What would happen if the clients write faster than the writing thread can consume? </li>
<li>If no one writes anything, how would your thread finish? You should check finished in the condition variable.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Review</h2>

<p>Your temporary table names don't say much about what they present. This makes it hard to figure out what they mean. Consider using better, more meaningful names.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>DROP TABLE #TEMPA;
DROP TABLE #TEMPB;
DROP TABLE #TEMPC;
DROP TABLE #TEMPD;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>It gets worse by aliasing these temporary tables with different letters:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>FROM #TEMPA AS A  -- Fair enough

FROM #TEMPA AS B  -- Mamma mia!
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>There is only a need for an <code>order by</code> in the resulting query and the analytical functions (<code>row over</code>), not in the temporary tables.</p>

<p>There is no need for the temporary tables, you could use CTE's instead.</p>

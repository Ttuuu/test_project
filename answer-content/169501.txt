<p>Your code looks nice though I'd change a few small bits related to code formatting. </p>

<p>I'd change:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>int[] cyclic = new int [size]</code>  remove space in <code>int [size]</code> so it'll become <code>int[size]</code></li>
<li>add a new line under <code>int[] cyclic = ...</code> so you have a bit of separation so it's just a bit better structured</li>
<li>remove the braces near the <code>for</code>-loop so it doesn't add unnecessary noise to the code.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are my personal recommendations only though</p>
    </div>

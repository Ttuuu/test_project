<p>I think <code>RangeCollection</code> would be a better name than <code>Ranges</code>.</p>

<p>To my mind, the <code>RangeIterator</code> is doing too much.  It's iterating over a collection of ranges and over each range in the collection.  To me it would make more sense for the <code>Range</code> class to have its own iterator and the <code>RangeCollection</code> its own iterator</p>

<p>I would like to put just few recommendation or considerations, not full code review evaluating design patterns or functional issues.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>Checkout()</code> method has two lines. I would use old method body style with curly braces instead of expression body defnition with lambda operator <code>=&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>I would rename <code>Checkout()</code> method to something more self-explanatory, e.g. <code>GetTotalCostAfterDiscount()</code> or <code>_basket.Calculate()</code>. </li>
<li>In your first test method, I would check one book basket calculation with the same concept as used in all other tests. Or you can add test with no added books (boundary value tests).</li>
<li>When reading this lambda <code>.Sum(set =&gt;</code> I was firstly confused, that <code>set</code> is some keyword. I would personally use <code>s =&gt;</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I like your solution, I cannot see any major issues. It is neat, following SOLID principles and naming conventions. Thanks.</p>

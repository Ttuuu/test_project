<p>Some suggestions related to <em>review</em> performance:</p>

<ul>
<li>This code is really hard to read. As far as I can tell every single variable except for <code>primes</code> is abbreviated to the point where I need to hold the entire program in memory in order to reason about any part of it. Naming is <em>really</em> important for readability, and readability is really important for comprehensibility. <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan" rel="noreferrer">Relevant quote</a>:

<blockquote>
  <p>Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the first place. So if you're as clever as you can be when you write it, how will you ever debug it?</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li>Pulling out functions should also make the code much easier to understand. I would recommend adding <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html" rel="noreferrer">type hints</a> and validating them using a strict <a href="https://github.com/python/mypy" rel="noreferrer"><code>mypy</code></a> configuration</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ambv/black" rel="noreferrer"><code>black</code></a> can format your code to be much more idiomatic.</li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8" rel="noreferrer"><code>flake8</code></a> can give you some hints about writing idiomatic Python.</li>
<li>There are at least three unused imports.</li>
<li>I would recommend avoiding <code>import *</code> in general; in a dynamic language like Python it's harder to reason about the code in that case, and it's easier to run into naming conflicts.</li>
</ul>

<p>Performance-related suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li>It looks like <code>mexp</code> is only set once, but <code>pow(2,mexp)</code> is calculated in a bunch of places. This can be calculated once outside both loops. There are other duplicate calculations - they should all be run only once, and in the outermost context.</li>
</ul>

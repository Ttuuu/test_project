<p>Inside the inner loop, <span class="math-container">\$1/k\$</span> is a constant term. So you could extract that multiplication from the inner loop, and apply it on the computed subtotal. This won't change the order of complexity though.</p>

<p>I was wondering if there is a closed form for computing the sum of reciprocal powers (to replace the summing and thereby speed things up), but I couldn't find.</p>

<p>I was also wondering if you inverted the direction of computations to sum by columns instead of summing by rows, would there be a closed form to replace the summing, but I couldn't find that either.</p>

<p>Other than some clever math optimizations, the computation by rows or columns could run in parallel, but the input parameters would have to be large enough to be worth the overhead.</p>

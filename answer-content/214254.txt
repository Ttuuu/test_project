<p>You can reduce the need to use <code>print("")</code> by adding a <code>\n</code> after each statement. You can also use a one-line if statement to reduce the four line if statement. </p>

<p><code>count = count - 1</code> is the same as <code>count -= 1</code>, which reduces the amount of code you need to write.</p>

<p>This is assuming you are using <code>Python 3.6</code></p>

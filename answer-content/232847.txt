<p>Use <code>collections.defaultdict()</code> rather than <code>dict.setdefault()</code>.</p>

<p>Instead of nested loops to find subsequence, keep a dict mapping items to their positions.  For each item in the sequence check if that item was in the sequence before.  If it is, only check for subsequences starting at those positions.  I think on average, this will do better than the nest loops:</p>

<pre><code>seen_items = defaultdict(list)

for pos, item in enumerate(sequence):
    if item in seen_items:
        for other_pos in seen_items[item]:
            ...check for matching subsequences starting at pos and other_pos
            ...and add them to the dict of sequences...

    seen_items[item].append(pos)
</code></pre>

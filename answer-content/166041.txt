<li><p>You don't need to create a list. Just iterate over potential divisors:<br>
<code>for d in xrange(2, x): ...</code></p></li>
<li><p>The condition <code>x - 1 &gt; 2</code> seems kind of complicated. I suggest adding a guard at the beginning of the function:</p>

<pre><code>if n &lt;= 1:
    return False
</code></pre>

<p>and using a generic procedure for all other numbers (including 2. It works for <code>x = 2</code>. There's nothing special about it). It'll make your code easier to follow. </p></li>
<li><p>You can make it more efficient by checking the divisors only up to <code>sqrt(x)</code> inclusively. If a number is not a prime, it must have at least one divisor not greater then its root. </p></li>

<p>It appears that you are using <code>Random</code> across multiple threads. I guess you plan to replace it in the future, but still, <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Random.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">according to the documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Instances of <code>java.util.Random</code> are threadsafe. <strong>However</strong>, the concurrent use of the same java.util.Random instance across threads may encounter contention and consequent poor performance. Consider instead using ThreadLocalRandom in multithreaded designs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should probably rewrite this to use <code>java.util.concurrent.ThreadLocalRandom</code>. <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ThreadLocalRandom.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">As the docs say:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When applicable, use of <code>ThreadLocalRandom</code> rather than shared <code>Random</code> objects in concurrent programs will typically encounter much less overhead and contention.</p>

<p><strong>Single Responsibility Principle</strong>  </p>

<p>This method is doing to much. It is compressing the string <strong>and</strong> writes it to the <code>Console</code>. You can avoid this by returning a string from this method and add another method for doing the output.  </p>

<p><strong>General</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>if you would increase <code>i</code> before the inner <code>while</code> loop you will save one iteration of this loop. You don't need to check the character against itself.<br>
If you change this you need to initialize <code>n</code> with <code>1</code>.  </p></li>
<li><p>The condition <code>if(n == 1)</code> should be removed because it doesn't add any value. A better way would be to check for <code>n &gt; 1</code> and if that is true add the count. Here a explaining comment about <strong>why</strong> this is used would be good.  </p></li>
<li><p>speaking about comments, comments should explain <strong>why</strong> something is done in the way it is done. Let the code speak for itself about <strong>what</strong> is done by using descriptive names for variables, methods and classes.  </p>

<p>A comment like </p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>// add characters to the new list 
CompressedList.Add(character.ToString());  
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>does not add value to the code but noise. We clearly see that the character is added to the list, so no need to comment on that.  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Other than these points I completely agree with @helix answer.</p>

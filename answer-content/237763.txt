<p>I'm wondering if it is the efficiency that resulted in you getting half points:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>runPartition</code> is rather an unclear name in itself;</li>
<li><code>highIndex</code> seems to be inclusive, which is uncommon (the number of elements is now <code>highIndex - lowIndex + 1</code>);</li>
<li><code>counterOne</code> and <code>counterTwo</code> are not good names for <em>indices</em> - even <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> would have been better;</li>
<li>it is very likely that the <code>localArray</code> as a field name raises some questions; why is it a field in the first place? And why is it called <code>local</code> if it is not local to the method?</li>
<li>it seems to me that you would set the <code>counterOne</code> to the index you want to swap and perform the decrease <em>afterwards</em> (possibly using <code>--</code> in the call to <code>swapValues</code>);</li>
<li>the braces are at uncommon and uneven positions when it comes to Java / indentation.</li>
</ul>

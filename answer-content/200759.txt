<p>This is based on a misunderstanding of the <code>Origin</code> header. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/15514049/138757">Chrome and Safari add this header to their web requests</a>, but other browsers don't necessarily. You only have to test this from a browser like Internet Explorer or Firefox to find out it won't work.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Forwarded" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Forwarded header</a> is probably more what you're looking for.</p>

<p>This header-based approach could be a security issue as well, depending on your environment. If your server is accessed directly somehow, then you're basically giving the remote client control over what URLs will be generated. All the client would need to do is manipulate the right headers in the right way. Giving remote clients control over your internal URLs sounds like a <em>very</em> bad thing.</p>

<p>You're probably better off using a server-side setting (perhaps in Web.config) that contains the public URI, and using that server-side setting instead.</p>

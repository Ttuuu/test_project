<p>Questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Why do you use the class field <code>_object</code>? Does it serve any real purpose that a method-local variable cannot?</li>
<li>Why do you implement <code>IEnumerable</code>?</li>
<li>(only consider this if you have a decent understanding of concurrency issues, and want to practice) How can you make this code thread-safe?</li>
</ol>

<p>Suggestions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Several method throw exceptions in unexceptionable scenarios. Why do you blow up if I want to print or clear an empty stack? That's like having the waiter shoot herself if I try to order food right as the kitchen has closed.</li>
<li>When you're done with the exercise, consider making your stack generic. Casting from <code>object</code> is <em>so</em> old-school C#.</li>
<li>Consider improving your error messages. For one, <code>"Cannot use .Pop() if list count equals 0."</code> could be something like: "Cannot pop an element off an empty stack".</li>
</ol>

<p>First off, I'm not a big fan of Bootstrap. It bloats the HTML with additional elements and classes. Also as a beginner it stops you from learning standard CSS.</p>
<p>Avoid using IDs to apply styles. IDs have a high <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity" rel="nofollow noreferrer">specificity</a> making organizing the style sheet more difficult. Use classes instead.</p>
<p>Don't write text in ALL CAPS. Use normal English capitalization and change the display with <code>text-transform: uppercase</code> in the style sheet. This helps screen readers understand and pronounce the text better, for example, by able to distinguish between words and abbreviations (e.g. "us" vs "U.S.").</p>
<p>The proper elements for what they are meant for. H4 and H6 are for headlines, not for addresses. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/address" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>address</code></a> element would be more appropriate.</p>
<p>Don't open links (especially "normal" ones inside the site) in new windows/tabs with <code>target="_blank"</code>.</p>

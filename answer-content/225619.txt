<p>I was interested to see your domain model, the <code>Book</code> class.</p>

<p>I noticed that you are using <code>Lombok</code>, <code>@EqualsAndHashCode</code>, override <code>equals</code>, <code>hashCode</code> and it has the builder pattern implemented. </p>

<ul>
<li>Why did you add <code>@EqualsAndHashCode</code> and then implemented both methods? You need to decide which approach you want.</li>
<li>Why did you implement the builder pattern instead of using <code>@Builder</code> Lombok annotation? Your approach seems inconsistent.</li>
</ul>

<p>I used to use Lombok and even their advanced features but stopped using this library. It was so easy to slap bunch of annotation and move one creating classes with bunch of code that was not needed. There are articles explaining other reasons why not to use Lombok. My advise is to not to use it.</p>

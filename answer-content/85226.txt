<p>If the input is large, the code will run for a very, very long time. If you changed the type from int to int64_t, it could run forever. </p>

<p>You could use the fact that 64 % 9 == 1, therefore (64x + y) % 9 == (x + y) % 9. </p>

<pre><code>while (x &gt;= 64) x = (x &gt;&gt; 6) + (x &amp; 0x3f);
while (x &gt;= 9) x -= 9;
</code></pre>

<p>Even for the largest x you will have less than 20 loop iterations in total.</p>

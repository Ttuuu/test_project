<p>a few things you should considered : </p>

<ol>
<li>Never change the original values, and always make your changes on different copy.</li>
<li>Always think of a good naming strategy (Naming Convention),  based on type, and purpose of the code. </li>
<li>Always make your code available for expansions by modulate your code into different group of actions or processes (use methods, properties, classes ..etc.) apply Object-Oriented-Programming principles.</li>
<li>Always review your code, search for weaknesses, bugs, and simulate some invalid inputs (common ones) by testing the code and handle them (like adding validations, restrictions ..etc). </li>
<li>Always separate the business logic from user logic (define classes for them along with any related necessary objects).</li>
<li>before using a loop, search for a way to get the same results without a loop, sometimes you can get the same output and process without a loop specially in mathematical operations. </li>
<li>simplify your code, and avoid redundancy whenever possible.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think the header could be trimmed down a lot. The constant tables belong in the implementation file since they are not needed for the definition of the class.</p>

<p>Since the AES class does not hold any state (except for that inherited from <code>BlockCipher</code>), I would not declare the private functions in the header, but only keep them in the implementation file in an anonymous namespace.</p>

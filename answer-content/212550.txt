<p>I think this depends a lot on your motivation for separating these into two methods.</p>

<p>One simple option I would consider first is to just have 1 version of each of these functions to avoid the duplication in the first place. 
The caller can just ignore the <code>max_dist</code> value if they don't need it.</p>

<p>If performance is an issue and <code>max_dist</code>calculation could be a bottleneck, you could add a Boolean argument to the single function to indicate if <code>max_dist</code> should be calculated or not.</p>

<p>If the logic for <code>max_dist</code> is complex enough to hurt the readability of the basic search, I think you may be better off going with the duplication instead of doing something more complex.  It could be done, but not in a way I would consider reasonable in most cases.</p>

<p>Well, I am not an expert with PHP, but I can point out one or two things in this code.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Keep the page and views names as constants in one place. Do not use strings to redirect, but use refs to these constants. This way you have to change it from one place if/when you rename a page/view</p></li>
<li><p>Use a function to invoke for redirect which will check the currentRoute. Do not check this in each case/else if</p></li>
<li><p>Collect the vars you want to use in advance. Do not ask Auth::user()-&gt; on and on. This is totaly OK but for better readability you could -and should- spare a few nsecs.</p></li>
</ol>

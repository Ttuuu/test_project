And you could separate the "front-end" (all of your prints and inputs) from your "back-end" (the functions/methods performing the calculations). This would also make it easier on yourself if you want to migrate away from a CLI app to something with a graphical interface (which could help make the formatting of the formulas more readable).</p>

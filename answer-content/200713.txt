<p>I do have some points in regards to scope. Having code like:</p>

<pre><code>if not args.threads is None:
    global NUMBER_OF_THREADS
    NUMBER_OF_THREADS = args.threads
</code></pre>

<p>means you'll encounter weird issues when values change and you need to track them down. Obviously I'm talking big picture for your future code. It's better to move this into your entry point, as you don't really need to care about the scope of args.threads after spawning the threads, correct? That will also eliminate the LARGE_WORD_IN_CAPITALS which means you're also doing something wrong (defining a global).
Something as simple as (untested example) to fix this.</p>

<pre><code>from multiprocessing import Queue, cpu_count
thread_count = args.threads or cpu_count() # or os.cpu_count()
</code></pre>

<p>Threading - I'm guessing you're using that to "speed up" things? <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">You might want to use multiprocessing</a> instead. </p>

<p>And regarding all your if statements in regards to the <code>args is None</code> code, introduce default values. </p>

<p>Finally, if you have to do all those if statements in the args check - group them together. </p>

<pre><code>if a and b=this:
    ...
if a and b=that:
    ...
if a and b=whatever:
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>can be reduced to,</p>

<pre><code>if a: # (into an inner block)
    if b=this:
        ...
    if b=that:
        ...
    if b=whatever:
        ...
</code></pre>

<p>This is much cleaner.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

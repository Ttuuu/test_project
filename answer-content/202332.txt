<p>One technique is to default the value to <code>NULL</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$var = NULL;
if (isset($_GET['var'])) {
    $var = $_GET['var'];
} ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then when setting the attribute on the tag, <code>isset()</code> doesn't need to be used.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;body class="whatever" &lt;?php if($var) {echo "id=\"$var\""; } ?&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that it is recommended that PHP not be mixed in with HTML code. For a good explanation, refer to <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/291839/244085">this answer to <em>Should I Include PHP code in HTML or HTML in PHP?</em></a> on the Software Engineering site. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Mixing languages is not a good idea.</strong> You don't put JavaScript in HTML, or HTML in JavaScript, or JavaScript in PHP, or HTML in Python or Ruby in SQL.<sup><a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/291839/244085">1</a></sup></p>

<p>As is recommended by <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/291839/244085">that post</a>, consider the use of templates:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What are you probably looking for is called <strong>templates</strong>. Depending on the framework you use, it may already be available, usually under a form of MVC, where the template is in the view, or you may have to use a third-party template engine, such as <a href="http://www.smarty.net/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Smarty</a>.</p>
  
  <p>In both cases, the idea remains the same. You have PHP code strictly separated from the template which contains the HTML and a bit of very simplistic logic: simple loops over entities, <strong>conditions for conditional displaying of information</strong>, etc. When the PHP code is ready, it calls the template engine, passing to it some information. The engine uses a specific template to build the final output (often HTML, but other formats are possible as well) which is then sent to the user.<sup><a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/291839/244085">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I would recommend just using the built in functionality of <code>print</code> to do the flushing. Though I am an advocate for breaking things out into classes and functions, you should use built in functionality when you can. </p>

<p>Making code complex for no reason results in two things: </p>

<p>1) More bugs.<br>
2) More programmers who want to wring your neck down the road because they have to maintain or fix your software.</p>

<p>So you can simplify your code like this:</p>

<pre><code>from time import sleep

BLINK = 0.2

print("\n\tSTART PRINTING\n")

with open('example.txt') as f:
    for line in f:
        for char in line:
            print(char, flush=True, end='')
            sleep(BLINK)

print("\n\tEND PRINTING\n")
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to make this into a function (to make it easier to import/export) then I would do following:</p>

<pre><code>from time import sleep

def time_print_file(filename, print_rate, **print_kwargs):
    """
    INPUT:
        filename: The path to the file to be printing
        print_rate: The delay used to print each character
        print_kwargs: keyword arguments accepted by pythons
           print statement. (Except `end` and `flush`)
    """
    print_kwargs.pop('flush', None) # We don't allow the flush print-keyword
    print_kwargs.pop('end', None) # We don't allow the end print-keyword
    with open(filename) as f:
        for line in f:
            for char in line:
                print(char, flush=True, end='', **print_kwargs)
                sleep(print_rate)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    print("\n\tSTART PRINTING\n")
    time_print_file(filename='example.txt', print_rate=0.2)
    print("\n\tEND PRINTING\n")
</code></pre>
    </div>

<p>I guess from efficiency point of view this is fine, even that last line. Efficiency points:</p>

<ul>
<li>You create player variable as <code>list</code> and then keep converting to set over and over again, why not have it as set from beginning?</li>
</ul>

<p>From readability and maintenance point of view, you are having lots of duplicities.</p>

<ul>
<li>Player moves are exactly same except for message and variable, you can extract that to function.</li>
<li>Same goes for checking if a player won.</li>
<li>I don't like variable <code>w</code>. Why not make variable <code>winner</code> instead and save name of winner into it? Related to extracting if player won to separate function.</li>
</ul>

<p>And for your last line - you can put all possible winning combinations into array or tupple and then check that in cycle (you get the idea):</p>

<pre><code>winning_combinations = [
[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6],
...
]
</code></pre>

<p>The variable names <code>path1</code> and <code>path2</code> are bad since they are not as descriptive as possible. They should rather be <code>srcdir</code> and <code>dstdir</code> (if you prefer abbreviations), or <code>source_directory</code> and <code>destination_directory</code> if you want to have them spelled out.</p>

<p>Instead of manipulating strings, it's better to use the <code>pathlib</code> library, which has the handy function <code>with_suffix</code>.</p>

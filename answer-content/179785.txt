<p>Fix your formatting. While the computer doesn't care about indentation, humans do. And code is <em>read</em> (by humans) many more times than it's <em>written</em>. And this code is hard to read.</p>

<p>The whole "draws" logic can be replaced with a simple check: <code>human == comp</code>.</p>

<p>Determining the winner of a "hand" in rock-paper-scissors can be done in many, many, many ways. You're checking it "manually" in a sense, by writing out all the possible combinations. But you could also assign numeric values to the choices (for instance, their index in an array), and compare those numbers instead. Or so something like this, where the player's choice is used to determine what the winning response <em>would</em> be and see if the computer picked that:</p>

<pre><code>choices = %w(rock paper scissors).reverse

index = choices.index(player_choice)
winning_choice = choices[index - 1] 

if computer_choice == winning_choice
  # computer wins
else
  # human wins
end
</code></pre>

<p>(this assumes that <code>player_choice</code> and <code>computer_choice</code> have already been set and that you've checked for draws.)</p>

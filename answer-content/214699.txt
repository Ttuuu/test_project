<p>As suggested by <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/40474/hagen-von-eitzen">@HagenvonEitzen</a> <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/214443/how-to-know-if-today-is-second-or-fourth-saturday#comment414714_214443">in the comments</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today is the first Saturday of the current month iff it is Saturday
  and the day is between 1 and 7, inclusive. It is the second Saturday
  iff it is Saturday and the day is between 8 and 14, inc[l]usive. It is
  the third Saturday iff it is Saturday and the day is between 15 and
  21, inc[l]usive. It is the fourth Saturday iff it is Saturday and the
  day is between 22 and 28, inc[l]usive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, just test against that:</p>

<pre><code>from calendar import SATURDAY

def second_fourth_saturday(date):
    if date.weekday() != SATURDAY:
        return False
    day = date.day
    return day in range(8, 14 + 1) or day in range(22, 28 + 1)
</code></pre>

<p>This uses the fact that <code>in</code> tests for <code>range</code> are constant time in Python 3 (in Python 2 they were not).</p>

<p>You could also hardcode those numbers:</p>

<pre><code>POSSIBLE_DAYS = set(range(8, 14 + 1)) | set(range(22, 28 + 1))

def second_fourth_saturday(date):
    return date.weekday() == SATURDAY and date.day in POSSIBLE_DAYS
</code></pre>
    </div>

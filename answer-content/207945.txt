<p><em>Will finish review later <strong>if I have a chance</strong>!</em> The most important thing is to create functions for <strong>repeated</strong> code. Using classes instead of list/tuple/dictionary-based structures also helps. May I refer you to <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">The Zen of Python</a>?</p>

<p>Tips in the order came up with them:</p>

<ol>
<li>You have an unused <code>import os</code>.</li>
<li>IMO, it makes more sense to use the term "hand" to refer to each player's cards and "deck" to refer to the cards not yet dealt.</li>
<li><code>check_deck</code> would be better named <code>sum_hand</code>.</li>
<li>Extracting your input code into a function called <code>input_integer</code> would greatly improve readability.</li>
<li>IMO, it doesn't really make sense to add pauses.</li>
<li>It might make sense to extract your prompts as constants to allow for decreased clutter and easier internationalization.</li>
<li>Code such as <code>for i in range(len(player_list)):</code> can should be refactored into <code>for player in player_list:</code> (or <code>for i, player in enumerate(player_list):</code> if the index is necessary). This is both more efficient and more readable.</li>
<li>If you use f-strings, there's no point in using concatenation.</li>
<li>Make sure to use variable names that are as descriptive as possible.</li>
<li>Make sure to use a <code>main</code> function and an <code>if __name__ == '__main__':</code> check. See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/20158605/5445670">this answer</a> (as well as the other answers to that question) for more information.</li>
<li>Use in-place operators (e.g. <code>a = a + b</code> is (almost) identical in functionality to <code>a += b</code>).</li>
<li>I may have forgotten to mention some things.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Remember to use functions to your advantage and use descriptive names!</em></p>

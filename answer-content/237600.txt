<ul>
<li><code>fizzBuzzOutputsRepo</code> is an in-memory map and there is no data persistence. So if the web server crashes, then there will be data loss. </li>
<li>Even if data persistence is out of scope for the interview question, by default a web server works in a multi-user environment. However, there is no synchronization method to protect the data integrity of <code>fizzBuzzOutputsRepo</code>. The simplest way is to use <code>syncronize</code> keyword when declaring <code>fizzBuzzOutputsRepo</code>. </li>
<li>Java has <code>java.time.LocalDateTime</code> library which can give you the current system clock time. It does seem like an overly heavy approach to make an HTTP request to some external endpoint to just get current date time. Because that introduces complexity such as managing outgoing HTTP connection pool, dealing with upstream connection timeout etc. </li>
<li>From API design perspective, the common practice is to version the API and use the resource name in URL: 
For instance <code>api/v1/fizzbuzz/</code> is the common part of the route. For GET and DELETE, <code>api/v1/fizzbuzz/{fizzbuzz_id}/</code> means operating on a single resource while <code>api/v1/fizzbuzz/</code> means operating on all resources. Although it is generally not good practice to support operation on all resources because as the amount of data increases, it puts increasing demand on a single web server and other parts of the stack such as the database that stores the data. </li>

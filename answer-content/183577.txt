<p>Oscar already pointed out that this algorithm is a bad one, but I'd like to give you some advice on how to check code for some of the more obvious flaws in the future. As the most basic test of an encryption algorithm, the output it generates should at least look 'random' when fed any type of input. Patterns in the output are always bad, because they reveal something about the input. Your code applies the same transformation to every element in the input, so if the input was all 0s, the output will only contain 1 unique value as well. This is the same flaw which you can see with the famous ECB Penguin. <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bXAUL.png" alt="ECB penguin"></p>

<p>Every pixel in the penguin is modified with the same function, so outlines of regions are clearly visible even if every individual pixel has been modified in a complex way.</p>

<p>To improve on this, you're going to first need to learn a bit about cipher modes of operation and pseudo-random permutations. I would recommend starting by learning how CTR mode encryption works and trying to implement it because it is one of the simplest to understand.</p>

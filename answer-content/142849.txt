<p>Seems to me like you're on the right track, but the significant problem with your implementation is the fact that you're using recursion. Instead (to make it iterative), you should have one function that partitions your array, a small data structure to use as a pointer to walk across the array, and a function that performs the sorting. I started on my own solution, but found this <a href="http://www.softwareandfinance.com/CSharp/QuickSort_Iterative.html" rel="nofollow">one</a> to be more descriptive. There are also plenty of other examples of other sorting methods linked to it that I hope will help.</p>

<p>Rather than two comprehensions, it'd be simpler to just use one <code>for</code> loop. Make <code>new_list_a</code> and <code>new_list_b</code> start empty, and if the item is good add to both at the same time. This is simpler to understand, as you see clearly that both are being filtered by the same thing.</p>

<pre><code>new_list_a = []
new_list_b = []
for a, b in zip(list_a, list_b):
    if a != '':
        new_list_a.append(a)
        new_list_b.append(b)
</code></pre>

<p>However, it looks like you'd be better served if you only create one list. This means you can have a tuple of <code>(a, b)</code>. And so could implement something like:</p>

<pre><code>[(a, b) for a, b in zip(list_a, list_b) if a != '']
</code></pre>
    </div>

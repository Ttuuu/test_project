  <p>I would like to hear how to make it more an one liner since I guess the code might be written with significantly less lines and still be readable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Excessively compressed (write-only):</p>

<pre><code>say sum m:g/\*&lt;(\-?\d+\,?\d*/».trans: ',' =&gt; '.' given slurp
</code></pre>

<p>Nice, readable, maintainable code if it can be assumed that later readers will know P6 or have enough patience to read its doc to learn the P6 used:</p>

<pre><code>my $score = / '*' &lt;( '-'? \d+ ','? \d* /;

say sum slurp.match( :g, $score )».trans: ',' =&gt; '.'
</code></pre>

<p>If one has to assume later readers won't know P6 and won't read the docs without prompting then I might reluctantly add comments:</p>

<pre><code># See docs.perl6.org/language/regexes#Capture_markers:_%3C(_)%3E 
my $score = / '*' &lt;( '-'? \d+ ','? \d* /;

# See docs.perl6.org/language/operators#methodop_%C2%BB._/_methodop_%3E%3E.
say sum slurp.match( :g, $score )».trans: ',' =&gt; '.'
</code></pre>

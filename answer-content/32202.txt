<p>To start with, it might be that IE7 is so slow, you can't really tell the differences with such small numbers. Another factor might be that "length" calculation is really slow on an array this size (well, back then ...) and that array access is "optimized" (at least better, and doesn't hurt much more than static property access).
But I think that IE7's just too slow for us to notice.</p>

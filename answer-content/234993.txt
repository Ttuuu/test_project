<p>My usual advice for implementors of recursive algorithms Is this: figure out how to do it without recursion (although i dont know how to prove it Is Always better, i can prove it Is never worse. And i can prove it Is Always possible.)</p>

<p>This advice Is yet stronger in your case because there Is nothing recursive about pagination. Its you who made it recursive artificially.</p>

<p>Further, the api has reasons to provide the data with a page limit. They dont want to run to memory issues when serving those data to you.</p>

<p>Nor should you want to run into memory issues when processing the data. If Its not restricting you, you should also process the data page by page discarding the previous page before loading another one.</p>

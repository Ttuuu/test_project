<p>Not much time, so just in short:</p>

<li>Definitely the second. It shows that you have got at least a general grip on datastructures (knowing the complexity of HashSet operations) and know a bit about the standard library. Regarding the fist one: this even uses a loop instead of <code>indexOf</code> - I'd immediatly show you to the door for that, if I were the interviewer...</li>
<li>Second is definitely better, but not impressive eiher. Try getting a grip on the stream API and play around with <code>String.codePoints</code> - my own try-that-for-comparison-solution was 2 lines using this...</li>
<li>You shouldn't. From my opinion, it is OK to explain in addition that there <em>might</em> be a possible solution using binary search over the stones string, which completes in \$O(n\times log(n))\$, but I would not to see an even longer solution for micro-optimizing a simple problem which takes milliseconds to execute. Simplicity, readability and clarity are the key attributes.</li>

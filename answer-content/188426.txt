<p>I tested your code on a set of 100k patterns and an alphabet of 2.5k symbols and automaton construction took ages.</p>

<p>After a closer look, I found that the failure function construction part keeps iterating over the whole alphabet, where instead it could have just used the children of the current trie node -- which are typically like an order of magnitude fewer in number than the size of the alphabet :) (to me it was two orders of magnitude)</p>

<p>This optimization sped up the automaton construction by the corresponding orders of magnitude.</p>

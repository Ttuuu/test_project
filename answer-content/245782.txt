<p>Make a data structure, an object, to hold all the data and meta data. The goal is to replace all that disconnected literal object creation with looping through the data structure.</p>
<p>My sense is the structure is a composite of "row header", "column header", "grid data" objects.  Put all of your meta data there, including properties to hold heading text, controller references and <code>Container</code> properties; and maybe a spot to put a reference to the associated UI grid-square if needed. So "Row Header" is an array of "top-row-grid-square" objects, in order left to right.</p>
<p>Then I see other objects that map the data to the actual UI grid. But it's all general looping through the data structure because the structure is organized to map to the UI.</p>

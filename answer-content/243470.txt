<p>You recursive solution takes numbers from <code>[0..left]</code> and <code>[right..n-1]</code> where <code>(left+1)+(n-right) &lt;= k</code> So even if there are k ways to select some elements from left and others from right, i.e. <code>(0,k), (1,k-1), ... (k,0)</code>. You look at far more a bigger sample space, in worst case, it would be <span class="math-container">\$O(n^2)\$</span>. I don't think much can be done with this approach.</p>

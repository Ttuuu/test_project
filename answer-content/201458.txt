<p>I think your solution is already pretty good. It is at worst \$\mathcal{O}(n)\$ in both runtime and memory. You use <code>enumerate</code> instead of iterating over the indicies manually.</p>

<p>The only four things I would comment on are:</p>

<ol>
<li>In real life code, this being a <code>class</code> would of course  be completely unnecessary (but it seems to be mandatory in this case).</li>
<li>Explicitly returning <code>None</code> at the end. This is always a judgement call between being unnecessarily verbose (since it is returned implicitly anyways) and being more expressive. Since this case is explicitly excluded in the problem description (all inputs have exactly one solution), I would not add it here. If it were an explicit rule to return <code>None</code> in case there was no solution I would, however, include it.</li>
<li>You should add some <code>docstring</code> to the class/method. At least to get in the habit of always doing it.</li>
<li>Python's official style-guide, PEP8, recommends using <code>lower_case</code> for variable, function and method names (but this seems to also be mandatory from the problem description).</li>
</ol>

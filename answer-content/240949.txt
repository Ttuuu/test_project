<h1>Single Responsibility</h1>
<p>You are doing a few things in main:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read srcPath and destPath from the properties file</li>
<li>Understand which service is responsible for each path</li>
<li>Find the relevant copy function</li>
<li>Call the copy function</li>
</ul>
<p>I suggest creating a method for each of the above bullets.</p>
<h1>Polymorphism</h1>
<p>You asked</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there a better OOP way to solve this?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I guess you mean Polymorphism as it one of the key features of OOP.</p>
<p>One way is to write a function that returns the relevant function. Scala support functions types very well.</p>
<p>Another way is creating a trait and classes that implement it (as you did the question you deleted) and a function or factory object that return the relevant class. This way is more common in OOP. Also, it is better in terms of single responsibility:<code>CopyFiles</code> do a lot of different types of copies.</p>
<h1>Avoid Ifs</h1>
<p>In the question you deleted, you asked if you can rid of the ifs. when the input is the services names(and not the paths), I believe you can use pattern matching easily.</p>

<p>A solution which does <em>not</em> overflow, is XORing all the numbers istead of adding them, and XORing the result with the expected accumulated XOR over the range.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that the expected value can be computed in constant time, since XOR over the range <code>[0, N]</code> is <code>N</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>N+1</code>, or <code>0</code> depending on <code>N%4</code>.</p>

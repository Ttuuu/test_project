<p>The problem statement says (<strong>bold</strong> emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Write a function that takes a list of values as an argument and <strong>returns a string</strong> with all the items separated by a comma and a space, with 'and' inserted before the last item. For example, passing the previous spam list to the function would <strong>return</strong> 'apples, bananas, tofu, and cats'. But your function should be able to work with any list passed to it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your function doesn't return anything, it just prints. So, what do I do if I want to display a list of groceries on a website? Or store it in a database? Or write it to a file? Or send it as an email? Or pipe it into a text-to-speech synthesizer?</p>

<p>I'll have to write the exact same code over and over again!</p>

<p>Instead, you should separate computation from input/output. (Not just because the problem statement says so, but as a general rule.)</p>

<p>The immediate benefit is that you can easily test your code. If you print the result, in order to test the code, you would have to somehow intercept the standard output stream or re-direct the stream to a file and then read back and parse the file, or something similarly convoluted. If you separate constructing the string from printing the string, testing becomes much easier, you just write something like:</p>

<pre><code>spam   = ['apples', 'bananas', 'tofu', 'cats']
result = 'apples, bananas, tofu, and cats'

assert result == commatize(spam)
</code></pre>

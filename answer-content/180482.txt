<h2>Regarding performance</h2>

<p>There are three rules about performance: measure, measure, measure.</p>

<p>If you seek for a more performant solution, you should first determine how slow your solution currently is. So, you should measure how many seconds, milliseconds or microseconds this code takes to execute.</p>

<p>After that you can come asking for performance help. Telling us how slow exactly your code currently runs, why that speed is not acceptable for you, and what would be an acceptable speed.</p>

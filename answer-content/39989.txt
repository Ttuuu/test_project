<p>One thing I have done in the past is to convert the images to 64-bit encoded strings and just string compare.  It won't be as fast as using pointers, naturally.  However, it can be done entirely in managed code, it doesn't require you to know bits per pixel, and it works for the Image base class.</p>

<pre><code>byte[] image1Bytes;
byte[] image2Bytes;

using(var mstream = new MemoryStream())
{
    image1.Save(mstream, image1.RawFormat);
    image1Bytes = mstream.ToArray();
}

using(var mstream = new MemoryStream())
{
    image2.Save(mstream, image2.RawFormat);
    image2Bytes = mstream.ToArray();
}

var image164 = Convert.ToBase64String(image1Bytes);
var image264 = Convert.ToBase64String(image2Bytes);

return string.Equals(image164, image264);
</code></pre>

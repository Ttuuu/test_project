<p>A few notes to add to the existing answer(s):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It is not wrong use <code>not</code> in place of <code>!</code> but I'd like to claim that most programmers will find it odd. Shorthand operators are much more common and likely make parsing the code faster for most readers.</p></li>
<li><p>It appears that your algorithm is not exact (i.e., it is not guaranteed to find an optimal coloring for every possible input). Rather, it looks to be the well-known greedy heuristic that goes through the vertices in some order, and always assigns to each vertex the lowest available color. As such, in principle, it can be implemented to run in linear time but I'm not certain what the complexity of all your <code>List</code> methods for example are.</p></li>
<li><p>Your internal storage for a graph is definitely not optimal. That is, your lists rely on pointers and there is no guarantee consecutive elements would be stored consecutively in memory (i.e., we should expect cache misses when accessing elements in your list). Storing and processing large graphs with your implementation will likely be slow. If you are curious about a faster implementation, you can have a look at <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/219748/40063">my earlier graph related answer here</a>.</p></li>

<p>Yes, the implementation is <em>short</em>.  However, its <em>efficiency</em> is suspect.  That's due to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Reassembling <code>list</code> every iteration</li>
<li>Testing every remaining member of list using <code>%</code> operator</li>
</ol>

<p>The beauty of Eratosthenes' sieve is that it shouldn't need any division (including <code>%</code>).  With an array of values, we simply march along it in steps of <code>n</code> striking out members - that requires only addition, which is one of the cheapest operations in a digital computer.  (There's an optimisation that also requires multiplying a number by itself; that's only used because it's <em>faster</em> than the equivalent additions).</p>

<p>Removing the empty cells at every iteration prevents us from accessing every nth element in this way, as well as imposing its own overheads (for a start, we'll need lots of extra memory when building the new list from the old).</p>

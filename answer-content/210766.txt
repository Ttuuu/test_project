<p>Your program is over-engineered in a way that makes it hard to decipher.  Because every method is one line long, it's like reading a poem whose lines have been scrambled.  You would be much better off writing a simple function, like this:</p>

<pre><code>require 'fileutils'

def move_screenshots(src_dir, dest_tree)
  re = /^Screen Shot (?&lt;year&gt;\d{4})-(?&lt;month&gt;\d{2})-(?&lt;day&gt;\d{2}) at/
  Dir.foreach(src_dir) do |filename|
    if date = re.match(filename)
      dest_dir = "#{dest_tree}/#{date[:year]}/#{date[:month]}/#{date[:day]}"
      FileUtils.mkdir_p(dest_dir)
      FileUtils.mv("#{src_dir}/#{filename}", dest_dir)
    end
  end
end

move_screenshots("/Users/home/Desktop", "/Users/home/Pictures/Screenshots")
</code></pre>

<p>I wouldn't bother with <code>Dir#glob</code>, since it's a bit redundant with the regex.  Note that screenshots aren't necessarily in PNG format: <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2014/07/31/how-to-change-mac-screenshot-file-format/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the image format can be configured using <code>defaults write com.apple.screencapture type â€¦</code></a>.  I also wouldn't bother testing <code>File#exists?</code> before calling <code>FileUtils#mkdir_p</code>, since <code>mkdir_p</code> implicitly performs that check anyway.</p>

<p>Instead of an hourly cron job, consider creating a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleScript/Conceptual/AppleScriptLangGuide/reference/ASLR_folder_actions.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Folder Action Script</a> that is triggered instantly when a file is added to the folder.</p>

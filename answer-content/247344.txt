<p>First of all, you should not mix css and js code. Move all css code to .css file and just use elements with classes and his own methods.</p>
<p>Good idea is to not use var, let and const is much better.</p>
<p>I also do not like this function expression contentScaling - in OOP this should be just private method in class. Now we have mix of JS and OOP patterns. Maybe scale and readableFont should be separate classes with better names.</p>
<p>I think, that you can split your code in more smaller functions, for example here:</p>
<pre><code>    document.body.style.zoom = convertPercentageToZoom(that.data.scaling);


    actionsBox.appendChild(heading);

    actionsGroup.appendChild(contentScaling);
    actionsGroup.appendChild(readableFont);
    actionsGroup.appendChild(fontScaling);

    actionsBox.appendChild(actionsGroup);

    return actionsBox;
</code></pre>
<p>This fragment of code do multiple things and at the end, returns object. For me much better idea is cut this fragment into smaller functions.</p>
<p>You should not also change explicity styles of elements, like here</p>
<pre><code>container.style.display = "flex"; // better idea is change or add class
</code></pre>
<p>Another thing = you can wrap all your code in IIFE and write 'use strict' statement only once.</p>
<pre><code>(function () {
  "use strict";
 
})();
</code></pre>
<p>Your class A11n is for me way too big and you should slice this class into multiple smaller classes.</p>

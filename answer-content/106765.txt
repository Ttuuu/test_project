<h1>Trie</h1>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie" rel="noreferrer">A trie would solve this problem perfectly</a>.  With a trie, you could search all your prefixes in \$O(n)\$ time, where \$n\$ is the length of the input string.  You current implementation requires \$O(m*n)\$ time, where \$m\$ in the number of prefixes and \$n\$ is the length of the input string.</p>

<p>Of course, the trie solution will be much more complex than your existing solution, so you will need to weigh the performance benefits of using a trie versus the simplicity of using a HashMap.</p>

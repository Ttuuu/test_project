<p>I think you're rather over-complicated this for yourself! A much better solution is to use the pattern matched results (which you are already creating (<code>t</code>)) (this requires C# 7.0 still, I believe).</p>



<pre class="lang-cs prettyprint-override"><code>foreach (Control c in form.Controls)
{
    switch (c)
    {
        case CheckBox cb:
            cb.Checked = false;
            break;
        case ComboBox cb:
            cb.Items.Clear();
            break;
        case CheckEdit ce:
            ce.Checked = false;
            break;
        default:
            c.Text = "";
            break;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>No dynamic here: <code>Text</code> is already a member of <code>Control</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Foreach loops are easier to read than <code>.Foreach</code> (in my opinion, at least; even if they are a bit funny underneath)</p></li>
<li><p>Your original <code>ToList</code> was redundant: no need to cache a result you are going to stream immediately in single-threaded logic</p></li>
<li><p>I've renamed <code>t</code> to something <em>slightly</em> less terrible; since they are very local variables indeed, I personally wouldn't worry to much about the names.</p></li>
<li><p>Note that this code will also clear the text on labels, and buttons, and everything else... so it seems an odd thing to provide as a form-wide operation.</p></li>

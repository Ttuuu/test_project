<p>There are a few obvious things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You loop from 20 to 0 every time. You only need to loop from 20 to 2 -- every number is evenly divisible by 1. </p></li>
<li><p>You divide <em>every</em> number from everything from 20 to 0. If it's not divisible by 20, why check if it's divisible by 19, 18, 17, etc? It already failed. </p></li>
<li><p>Only numbers ending in 0 are divisible by 10. You can eliminate a lot of possibilities right off the bat by checking for that. In fact, you can just increment by 10 every time. You've just cut the amount of numbers you're checking by an order of magnitude.</p></li>
<li><p>Only numbers ending in 0 or 5 are divisible by 5. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>There's a whole list of divisibility rules: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisibility_rule">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisibility_rule</a></p>

<p>I think just fixing those obvious things will be enough to see a significant increase in overall performance.</p>

<p>There's very little benefit in writing <code>decltype(n)</code> when we know that type is <code>std::size_t</code> - just write the known type.  <code>decltype</code> has its place, but that's normally in templates or where the type is difficult or impossible to write (usually when deduced using <code>auto</code>).</p>

<p>Of course, that's irrelevant once you apply the suggested improvement that removes the need for <code>&lt;cmath&gt;</code> and the casts.</p>

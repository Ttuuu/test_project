<p>Bug: when I run the program with argument 1, it prints 2 even though 2 &gt; 1.</p>

<p>The code is not optimized at all. It computes <code>ceil</code> and <code>sqrt</code> way too often, in a way that is obvious to optimize. All other prime programs on this site already do that, have a look at them.</p>

<p>The code is not optimized enough. It contains <code>i = i + 2</code>, which should have been <code>i += 2</code> from the beginning. A third of these calls can be omitted using the standard prime searching technique that has been mentioned more than enough on this site.</p>

<p>The variable name <code>flag</code> is terrible. It should be <code>is_prime</code> instead.</p>

<p>Having the most interesting code in the <code>BEGIN</code> block is bad design. You should define a function <code>is_prime</code> and another function <code>print_primes_up_to</code>. This allows you to declare <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> as local variables.</p>

<p>In the function <code>ceil</code>, the parameter name <code>n</code> is confusing since this name implies to the human reader that it is a natural number. In reality it is a floating point number though. A better name for this variable is <code>x</code>.</p>

<p>The code is missing some documentation. It should clearly state up to which number it reports correct results. It should also state the first number for which a wrong result is printed. Internally, many AWK implementations use 64-bit floating point numbers, therefore I guess this number is somewhere around <span class="math-container">\$2^{53}\$</span>.</p>

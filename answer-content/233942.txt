<p>Welcome to CodeReview.  What you are trying to do is simple enough that your LINQ implementation is okay.  Let's face it, with dominoes you are not going to have a million players with a million bones, so no need to worry about performance issues with a fairly small set.</p>

<p>You didn't ask explicitly for review of other parts of code, but I will offer them anyway.</p>

<p><code>Name</code> could be a read-only property set only in the constructor.</p>

<p>You have <code>Bones</code> as a field, not a property.  It could be exposed as a public <code>IReadOnlyList</code>, and it probably should be a property.</p>

<p><code>Bone</code> could be a <code>struct</code> or a <code>class</code> since it only has 2 <code>int</code> properties.  I do not like the names <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> as I tend to think of Cartesian coordinates and therefore a location.  I would prefer to see names like <code>Square1</code> and <code>Square2</code>.  I would probably keep this as a <code>class</code> and make the properties readonly as well.  You may consider adding extra properties such as <code>IsDouble</code>, and even override <code>ToString()</code> with <code>$"{Square1}-{Square2}"</code>, and maybe even <code>Pips</code> which is a sum of both squares.</p>

<p>As you are new to CR, since I have posted an answer, do NOT alter your code in your question or else a moderator will roll it back.</p>

<p>Sorry, I am giving no code (I am on a phone and I don't know Python), but be aware that if <code>m^2</code> is way lower than <code>n</code>, you could use the fact that your function gets periodical with a period maximally <code>m^2</code> (as both <code>a[-1]</code> and <code>a[-2]</code> can gain m different values).</p>

<p>You could test in your <code>for</code> loop if/when you reached your period (if <code>a[-2]==0</code> and <code>a[-1]==1</code>) and if so, variable <code>i</code> would indicate your period. Then you could simply grab <code>a[n%(i-2)]</code> as the answer, if I am not mistaken.</p>

<p>By the way, shouldn't the <code>for</code> loop range begin with 2?</p>

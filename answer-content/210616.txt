<p><strong>Context manager</strong></p>

<p>You open a file at the beginning of the program and close it explicitly at the end.</p>

<p>Python provides a nice way to allocate and release resources (such as files) easily: they are called Context managers. They give you the guarantee that the cleanup is performed at the end even in case of exception.</p>

<p>In your case, you could write:</p>

<pre><code>with open('YouTube Trending Titles on 12-30-18.csv','w') as file:
    ....
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Exception</strong></p>

<p>All exceptions are caught by <code>except Exception as e</code>. It may look like a good idea at first but this can lead to various issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>it's hard to know what types of error are actually expected here</li>
<li>most errors are better not caught (except for special situations). For instance, if you write a typo, you'll end up with an ignored <code>NameError</code> or <code>AttributeError</code> and debugging will be more painful than it should be.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, from the content of the <code>except</code> block, it looks like you are only expecting the logic about <code>description</code> to fail. If so, it would be clearer to put in the <code>try (...) except</code> the smallest amount of code.</p>

<p>For instance:</p>

<pre><code>title = content.h3.a.text
try:
    description = content.find('div', class_="yt-lockup-description yt-ui-ellipsis yt-ui-ellipsis-2").text
except Exception as e:
    description = None
print(title)
print(description)
print('\n')
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Proper solution</strong></p>

<p>Google usually offers API to retrieve things such like trending videos. I haven't found it but I'll let you try to find something that works properly. Google is your friend...</p>

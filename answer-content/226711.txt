<h3>Review</h3>

<ul>
<li>Your code is compact and well organised. Reusing <code>traverse</code> and <code>reduce</code> allows for easy extensibility.</li>
<li>Your <code>tree</code> could be a graph, or even worse a cyclic one: <code>traverse</code> could iterate to infinity.</li>
<li>By adding additional methods such as <code>descendants</code> and <code>ancestors</code> you could guard that the structure remains a tree. When adding a node, it cannot have a parent, it cannot be the node self, it cannot be a descendant or an ancestor.</li>
<li>You're allowing BFS and DFS, but only in <em>pre-order</em>. I would also include <em>post-order</em> (and perhaps also <em>in-order</em>).</li>
<li>Adding additional properties in a node might be useful for certain use cases: <code>root</code>, <code>depth</code>, <code>height</code>, <code>isleaf</code>, <code>isbranch</code></li>
</ul>

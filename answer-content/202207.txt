<h1>global</h1>

<p>this uses global variable <code>region_list</code>, but only <code>region_list.regions_d[region_number][0]</code>, which is probably a filename. Better would be to just pass the filename to this function, instead of using this global variable</p>

<h1>other tasks</h1>

<p>what does <code>colour_change_single(region_number, outcolour)</code> do? It looks unrelated to changing the image, so wouldn't it make more sense to have the one invoking <code>convert_colour</code> to also take care of this?</p>

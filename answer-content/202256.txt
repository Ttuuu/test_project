<p>as picture overview does looks like a beginner nice job, you miss something in <code>MODEL</code> part (a good model does not performs business logic: if you implement a <code>find()</code> method in <code>Controller</code>, you'll can modularize it to find between more files, just as example).</p>

<p>However there are some points you can focus on:</p>

<ul>
<li>access modificatiors of almost all variables and methods

<ul>
<li>when you need a constructor that always "<code>inits</code>", why don't simply create some objects and assign them inside the constructor ?</li>
<li>lack of "<code>final</code>" instance variables</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>After that, your <code>Controller</code> it's a "single tier" one.
Listeners can perform many actions but mainly can do themself   <em>look&amp;Feel</em> modifications (as example: background color while performing some actions) but for complex cases a listener it's usefull if can call a <code>Controller</code> (or a static method) to make decisions.</p>

<p>Responsability to addListener can be moved to the GUI part, and GUI can link (instance variable) a reference of the Controller they wants to use.</p>

<p>Split classes in packages it's a standard business approach but, even if it's an underrated advantage, can let you manage the class visiblities better.</p>

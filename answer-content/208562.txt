<p>Sorry I don't have time rn to properly look all through your code for you but one quick thing I noticed is that it would be much nicer to put your colours in a dictionary. It could be implemented like:</p>

<pre><code>colours = {"black": (  0,  0,  0),
           "white": (255,255,255),
           ...}
</code></pre>

<p>And then to get the colours you can just call colours["black"] rather than black which ties them all up together in one data structure which makes your code easier to understand and neater. Also, if you want to use your colors list which you currently have to iterate through (I don't know if you do), then you can use the new colours dictionary with <code>.index()</code></p>

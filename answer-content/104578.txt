<p>I am assuming you are going for the LinkedList way just to be able to check if the plant to left has some min value (as implemented by <code>currentNode.Next.Value &gt; cValue</code>). But for an integer linked list overhead may be more than whats worth. Just use List, and use <code>currentNode</code> as index, you can still test <code>list[currentNode+1] &gt; cValue</code> with few additional checks for making sure your curentNode is not the last element. Even now you are creating a list and throwing it away in the LinkedList initializer. </p>

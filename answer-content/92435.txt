<p>I found that your solution was a little too complex to understand.  I think that this strategy would be simpler.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

main ()
{
    int c;      /* c for characters */
    while ( ( c = getchar() ) != EOF )
    {
        if ( c == ' ') {
        while (( c = getchar() ) == ' ');
        putchar(' ');
    }

    putchar(c); 
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>It replaces the extra blanks with a single space.</p>

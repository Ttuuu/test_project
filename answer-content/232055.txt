<li>ItemLock._ItemLock is not used anywhere. Also, as a side note, I'm not a fan of using _NamesLikeThis for public items</li>
<li>Using a single lock may not be the best idea performance-wise (though heavily scenario-dependent). Consider using CuncurrentDictionary (which of course brings all sorts of new propblems, but this is how concurrency works). Also, you may consider using a ReadWriteLockSlim, it <em>might</em> be more performant in some scenarios</li>
<li>ReleaseLock is not safe if not matched by a Lock call. Which might happen for example in case of a ThreadAbort. An ugly, but widespread way of dealing with it is placing the critical code to a finally block.

<p>I don't fully understand what your script is doing, but I can offer a few refinements.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Regarding <code>$sectorUrl = $baseUrl . implode(",", array_keys($sectorInfo["selected_tickers"])) . "&amp;types=quote&amp;range=1m";</code>, because you are building a url, I think it would be better practices to implode with <code>%2C</code> to make the RFC folks happy.</p></li>
<li><p>It doesn't look like a good idea to append json strings after json strings.  For this reason, you should not be fwriting with <code>a+</code>.  If you mean to consolidate json data on a single json file, then the pre-written data needs to be extracted, decoded, merged with the next data, then re-encoded before updating the file.  Otherwise, you will generate invalid json in your .json file.</p></li>
<li><p>Rather than manually converting negative values to positive with <code>if ($indexSign &lt; 0) {$indexSign = - $indexSign;}</code>, you should be using <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.abs.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">abs()</a> to force values to be positive.</p>

<pre><code>$indexSign = abs($sectorIndexData["sector_value"]);
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The <code>$indexFactor</code> can be determined without iterated mathematics, you can treat it as a string and just count the zeros immediately to the right of the decimal place.</p>

<pre><code>$indexFactor = 10 ** strlen(preg_match('~\.\K0+~', $float, $zeros) ? $zeros[0] : 0)
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>\K</code> in the pattern means "restart the fullstring match" on perhaps it would be clearer for this situation to say "forget the previously matched characters (the dot)". 
<code>pow()</code> can be written as <code>**</code> from php5.6+</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Beyond those few pieces, I don't see much to comment on.  As I have stated in recent posts on your questions, always endeavor to minimize total fwrite() calls as much as possible.</p>

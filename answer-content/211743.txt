<p>Disclaimer: This question belongs to Stack Overflow, and I voted to migrate it. Therefore, the answer is not a review.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that principles are there to guide you. They should be treated like guard rails, rather than roadblocks.</p>

<p>I would argue that</p>

<pre><code>    while (....) {
        foo(7);
    }
    foo(3);
</code></pre>

<p>does <em>not</em> violate DRY. Your situation is pretty much the same.</p>

<p>That said, your idea of defining function is valid. You just factoring out the wrong code. Factor out reading. Consider</p>

<pre><code>    def read_n_lines(infile, n):
        lines = []
        try:
            for _ in range(n):
                lines.append(next(infile))
        except StopIteration:
            pass
        return lines
</code></pre>

<p>and use it as</p>

<pre><code>    while True:
        lines = read_n_lines(infile, 7)
        if len(lines) == 0:
            break
        process_lines(lines)
</code></pre>
    </div>

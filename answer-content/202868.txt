<p>While I see no problem design-like or code-like, in the point of view of the user, It can be frustrating. </p>

<p>I guess the method <code>ConfirmEmail</code> is called from a form. </p>

<p>So, imagine how frustrating it is if you fill a form and if there is any error in this form, it redirects you to the Error View ?</p>

<p>Imo, Error display should be handled by Javascript/Html/Css on the same page which thrown the error to avoid losing any data from user's pov. Like, displaying a notification or even an error message below the field.</p>

<p>How you display the error should be specific of the error.</p>

<p>I agree that your solution is proper and any reviewer would understand that you're experienced.</p>

<p>My suggestion, beyond palacsint's,  is that you slim your code down a bit to make it more readable. I cut 11 lines from <code>get</code>, decreasing it's length by 46%, without compromising on readability one bit.</p>

<pre><code>public function get($start=1, $end=100) {
    $data = array();

    for($num = $start; $num &lt;= $end; $num++) {
        foreach($this-&gt;fizzBuzz as $period =&gt; $text)
            if($num % $period === 0)
                $data[$num] = $text;
            else
                $data[$num] = $num;
    }

    return $data;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Of course this is personal preference, but I hope to inspire thought regardless of whether that would cause an actual change of mind or not.</p>

<p>PS. Sorry to comment on such an old question. I simply wanted to post my thoughts for anyone who might dig this up as I did.</p>

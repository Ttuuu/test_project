<p>Your code is confusing, since it refers to encryption in multiple places, e.g. the filename <code>encryption.py</code>, the function name <code>encrypt_password</code>, and multiple times in the docstrings for both <code>encrypt_password</code> and <code>check_password</code>, yet, the code has nothing to do with encryption.</p>

<p>In fact, storing passwords in encrypted form is one of the cardinal sins of information security, so if your code <em>were</em> doing what it claims to do, it would be fundamentally broken.</p>

<p>Thankfully, your code <em>doesn't</em> encrypt the passwords, it salts and hashes them … but then why doesn't it say so? The distinction between hashing (which is impossible to reverse) and encryption (whose sole purpose is that it <em>can</em> be reversed, otherwise it would be useless) is <em>fundamentally</em> important in Information Security, so confusing the reader of your code, <em>especially</em> if they are not experienced cryptologists, is not a good idea.</p>

<p>As a sidenote, bcrypt is no longer considered state-of-the-art in password-based key-derivation functions. It can too easily be sped up using GPGPUs, ASICs, and FPGAs. Consider using a more modern algorithm such as Argon2 (which seems to be the current consensus in the Information Security community, as far as I can tell).</p>

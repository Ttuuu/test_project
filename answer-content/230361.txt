<p>In my opinion the error handling is the smallest problem with this code. The main problem is that it's very unstructured and chaotic.</p>

<p>Every single function is reading from (and worse, sometimes writing to) variables outside its scope. It's impossible to know which data a function is actually working with or what has changed after it has run. </p>

<p>A function should only use any data passed to it through it's parameters and never change anything "outside". </p>

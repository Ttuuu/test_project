<p>The root of the problem lies in this line:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>dynamic expando = /* ParseConfigToJsonWithoutNulls -&gt; ParseJsonToExpandoObject */
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>where you decided to parse <code>*.json</code> files into an <code>ExpandoObject</code> and not directly into a <code>Dictionary</code> or some other strong type.</p>

<p>I bet you are using <code>Json.Net</code> for the job and there are <em>countless</em> possibilities to deserialize <code>JSON</code> in such a way that <code>ExpandoObject</code> is not necessary.</p>

<p>This means that the conversion should take place during deserialization and not after that.</p>

<hr>

<p>I suggest posting another question where you show us how you read your <code>*.json</code>. Maybe then we can help you to get rid of the <code>ExpandoObject</code> altogether.</p>

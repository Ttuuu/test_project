<p>Style wise, the assignment <code>currRes = currRes.next;</code> happens no matter what, so lift it out of <code>if-else</code> clause:</p>

<pre><code>            if (l1.val &lt; l2.val)
            {
                currRes.next = l1;
                l1 = l1.next;
            }
            else
            {
                currRes.next = l2;
                l2 = l2.next;
            }    
            currRes = currRes.next;
</code></pre>

<p>Correctness wise, the condition <code>if (l1.val &lt; l2.val)</code> loses the stability: if the elements compare equal, the one from <code>l2</code> is merged first. Consider <code>if (l1.val &lt;= l2.val)</code> (or even <code>if (l2.val &lt; l2.val)</code>) instead. It is not required by the problem statement, and it doesn't matter for <code>int</code>s. In real life however the stability is of utmost importance, and as an interviewer I'd definitely mark it.</p>

<p>On the bright side, a dummy head for the merged list is a right way to go. </p>

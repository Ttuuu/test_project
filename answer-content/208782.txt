<p>Thanks for sharing your code!</p>

<p>Almost everything looks good to me.</p>

<ul>
<li>You have documentation for the module :)</li>
<li>You have documentations for all your functions.</li>
<li>Naming seems good to me.</li>
<li>I did not see 'unpythonic' things in your code, maybe someone more experienced will have more to say on this?</li>
<li>You use a linter</li>
</ul>

<p>The major things I would change is adding a <code>__main__</code> to your script.</p>

<pre><code>if __name__ == "__main__":
    mad_libs()
</code></pre>

<p>When you run you script with <code>python mad_libs.py</code> it will behave the same but if you import your module in another script, it will not execute the function upon importing, which is I think the desired behavior.</p>

<p>As for improvements:</p>

<ul>
<li>you could use type annotations to do static validation with <a href="http://www.mypy-lang.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">MyPy</a></li>
<li>write some tests with unittest, pytest, nose ...</li>
</ul>

<p>Very nice code in my opinion.</p>

<p>Interesting problem, hard to solve with so Little information but perhaps test if you're data management is not as efficient as you hope or you might even have a locking issue on the database where you're blocking yourself.</p>

<p>Normally what I would do in a situation like this is the following. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Have the webservice write the data in a staging table and return as efficient as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>use a stored procedure to process the data on the server, Ideally use a Merge statement if you need to do update, insert and deletes.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I am guessing that your dbcontext is getting to much data in memory an that this causes to much server side processing. Have a look at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52257431/best-way-to-handle-large-data-in-entity-framework">this</a> post if you have large volumes.  </p>

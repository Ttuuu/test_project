<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>I've noticed a few small things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You don't need to flush the stream every time you log something. A simple newline will do.</p></li>
<li><p>A more suitable log stream provided by C++ would be <code>std::clog</code>. You may, however, need to flush this stream.</p></li>
<li><p>Your formatting is inconsistent. You have spaces in places where you don't have spaces elsewhere, including but not limited to: in template parameters and after <code>return</code>. This makes the code slightly hard to read.</p></li>
</ul>

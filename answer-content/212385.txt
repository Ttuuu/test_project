<ul>
<li>There's a bug: you're not checking if the last character is a letter or digit, only that it isn't a hyphen, so this fails to reject <code>"abcdef&amp;"</code>. Denis' solution may be less efficient (2 iterations instead of 1), but with at most 16 characters that's not much of a concern, and it's both easier to read and it works correctly.</li>
<li>The first two rules read very nicely. I especially like that the business rules are translated to code almost 1:1, that will make updating easier. However, I do think those extension methods are over-engineered. <code>str.Length &lt; 6 || str.Length &gt; 16</code> and <code>!char.IsLetter(str.First()) || str.Last() == '-'</code> is already quite readable, and that doesn't require extra code that needs to be understood and maintained.</li>
<li>You can use <code>=&gt;</code> syntax for methods with single-expression bodies.</li>
</ul>

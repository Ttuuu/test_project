<p>I think you need to add some middle-wares that helps to run your API code after that middle-ware with proper structuring way.</p>

<p>I would suggest the NPM Module <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-app-generator" rel="nofollow noreferrer">express-app-generator</a></p>

<p>The advantages of it include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Code Management in clean way.</li>
<li>Structured Routing.</li>
<li>Add Multiple Middle-Wares in filters array.</li>
<li>Create CRUD API's with <code>REST</code> or <code>CRUD</code> Keyword.  </li>
</ul>

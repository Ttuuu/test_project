<p><code>number%2</code> returns the remainder of <code>number</code> when divided by 2. Python is not a strongly typed language, so this remainder can be used as a boolean; if there is a remainder, <code>number%2</code> is truthy, and if the remainder is zero, then it is falsy. So you can replace your <code>if (number %2 ==0 ) [even stuff] else [odd stuff]</code> with <code>if (number %2) [odd stuff] else [even stuff]</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>if newNumber!=1:
     collatz(newNumber);
</code></pre>

<p>These lines seem to be based on the assumption that all numbers eventually reach 1. While this has been verified for numbers you are likely to come across, it hasn't been proven for all numbers. You might want to instead check whether you've entered a loop. Also I think it's better to explicitly return whether than relying on Python returning the last line executed by default, so  you should have <code>return(collatz(newNumber))</code>. And get rid of the semicolon.</p>

<p>Also, you're repeating a lot of code. The only difference between the odd and even case is that in the former case you have <code>3*number+1</code> and in the latter case you have <code>number//2</code>. The <code>print</code> and <code>return</code> statements are the same. So you can simplify your code to the following:</p>

<pre><code>if number%2:
   newNumber = 3*number+1
else:
   newNumber = number//2    
print(newNumber)
if newNumber == 1:
   return(newNumber)
else:
   return(collatz(newNumber))
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>return newNumber;</p>
  
  <p>try:
          number = int(input("Enter number:"))    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Keep in mind that this will reject <code>5.0</code>.</p>

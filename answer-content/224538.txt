<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>making your code harder to read:</p>

<ul>
<li>lack of docstrings</li>
<li>lack of comments</li>
<li>unwarranted indentation using an <code>else:</code> after a "disruptive <code>if</code>" 
(transferring execution with return, break, continue)<br>
(Here, you are using this with otherwise empty "<code>if</code>-parts":<br>
you could negate the conditions and just use the former <code>else:</code>-statements. Hello again, indentation.)</li>
</ul>

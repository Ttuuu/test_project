<p>Some more general things to consider.  Your class is called <code>FileAnalyzer</code>, but it advertises public properties like <code>getPrimeNumbersCount</code>, which I'd consider to be part of the analysis result (rather than the analyser itself).  Do they really belong there?</p>

<p>There's a similar issue around the way that you're storing the file to be analysed in a field of the analyser.  If a field isn't needed by at least two public member functions, I'd consider if it really needs to be a field or not. </p>

<p><code>FileNotFoundException</code> extends <code>IOException</code>, so you don't really need to declare that a method throws both of them.</p>

<p>Does the analyzer really need to be tied to an input file, or could it actually take in an <code>InputStream</code> as the source to analyse?  This approach makes the analyser more flexible (it could be used to process numbers from an API call, or could simply process numbers from a <code>String</code> for testing purposes), and pushes the decision about what type of stream to construct up to the caller, where there may be more context about the information's source.</p>

<p>Given those points, I'd expect the analyze function to have a signature more like:</p>

<pre><code>NumericAnalysis analyze(InputStream streamToAnalyse) throws IOException
</code></pre>

<p>As it stands, your public <code>analyze</code> method immediately delegates out to a private <code>countNumbers</code>.  You don't perform any signature adaption or anything else as part of this, so there doesn't really seem to be a reason for creating this extra layer of complexity.  Why not just put the code straight into the <code>analyze</code> method?</p>

<p>There's no validity checking when constructing a <code>BigInteger</code> when a <code>SEPERATOR</code> is encountered.  This might be OK in your scenario because you're confident about the source of the data, however it's good to consider what you would expect the behaviour to be if for example there were two spaces between a pair of numbers / if a file started with a space before the first number.</p>

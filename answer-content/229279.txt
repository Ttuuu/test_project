<p>Like other answers, this one uses a separate function for each rule.  Unlike the others it automatically collects the rules, so you don't need to keep a list or dictionary of all the rules.  Each function implementing a rule has a name that matches a pattern -- it ends with "_rule".  <code>calculate_score()</code> the scans <code>globals()</code> looking for the names of functions that match the pattern.  The same kind of thing is done by some testing frameworks.</p>

<pre><code>def first_and_last_digits_match_rule(zipcode):
    '''+5 when first and last digit match'''
    return 5 if zipcode[0] == zipcode[-1] else 0

    '''
    +6 when second digit is twice the first AND 
    third digit is greater than second or fourth digit
    '''
    return 6 if zipcode[:2] in ('12','24','36','48') and not (zipcode[1] &lt;= zipcode[2] &gt;= zipcode[3]) else 0

def any_7_rule(zipcode):
    '''+7 if any 7 is in the zipcode'''
    return 7 if '7' in zipcode else 0

def no_13_rule(zipcode):
    '''+8 when there's no "13" in MIDDLE the zipcode'''
    return 8 if '13' not in zipcode[1:-1] else 0

def triplet_rule(zipcode):
    '''+9 when all three middle digits match'''
    return 9 if zipcode[1] == zipcode[2] == zipcode[3] else 0

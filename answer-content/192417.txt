<p>You should add a difficulty level. For example, In easy mode, it is easier to find things and stuff. In hard, it should be just the way it is now.</p>

<p>e.g.</p>

<pre><code>#Variables
inform = Intro()
dist = inform[0][0]
scene = inform[0][1]
watersource = inform[0][2]
startingitems = inform[1]
hour = 0
dndeterminer = 0
lvl = int(input('What difficulty? 1 for easy, 2 for medium and 3 for hard.'))
if lvl == 1:
    hydration = 500
    heat = 500
    hunger = -400
elif lvl == 2:
    hydration = 300
    heat = 300
    hunger = -200
elif lvl == 3:
    hydration = 100
    heat = 100
    hunger = 0
shelter = False
clothing = True
</code></pre>

<p>You should add a health bar. So if a bear attacks you, you should just lose an amount of health, not just die instantly.</p>

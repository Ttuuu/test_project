<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>There is one thing that I believe could increase the performance of your application.</p>
<p>You often call <code>findElement</code>, which goes through the SAM record every time.</p>
<p>By loading a record, you are pretty certain that you will at least access it once.</p>
<p>At some point, maybe when creating the class, or when accessing the first property for the first time, you should "index" your SAM record.</p>
<p>Go through the whole file once and keep an array of where the tabs are. This way, if your code ends up calling :</p>
<pre><code>XsamReadQueries.findElement(read, 1)
XsamReadQueries.findElement(read, 2)
XsamReadQueries.findElement(read, 3)
</code></pre>
<p>The calls to the second and third method would be much faster than they are now.</p>
<p>To do this, you could add a method to <code>XsamReadQueries</code> names something like <code>IndexTabs</code>, that would return an array of ints.</p>
<p>If you want more insight as to how to do this, you can write a comment and I'll add more information, but I'm pretty sure this would help you.</p>
<h2>Code style</h2>
<p>There are one of two things that are bothering me in your code with regards to clarity and future maintenance.</p>
<p>You have methods named <code>findPhred</code>, which call <code>findElement</code> , but in your <code>SamRecord</code> sometimes you call <code>findElement</code> and something a specific <code>find*</code>, which is basically the same code. You should decide on one way to do things, either have specific methods for each field in the <code>XsamReadQueries</code> or keep only the <code>findElement</code> method.</p>
<p>Finally, you could consider using an <code>enum</code> for the <code>element</code> parameter of the <code>findElement</code> method.</p>

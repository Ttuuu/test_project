<p>Neat idea! Some suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>__exit__</code> should <code>try</code> to commit or roll back based on whether there is an unhandled exception, should then close the cursor, and should <code>finally</code> unconditionally close the connection. This is one of the main reasons for using a context manager - it is expected to always clean up after itself, leaving the relevant parts of the system in the same state as before using it.</li>
<li>I would reuse the configuration section name as the keys in the <code>dict</code>. That way you don't need to maintain a mapping in your head or the code - what's in the configuration is what you get when you use the context manager.</li>
<li>Rather than opening all connections and then using only one of them, it should open the connection and the cursor with the name passed in. Otherwise you're wasting resources.</li>
</ul>

<p>Probably need more context here, depending on the number of cases you could possibly make this cleaner by </p>

<pre><code>const availablePrompts = [“Test1”, “Test2”...]

if(availablePrompts.includes(prompt)) { 
  alert(prompt)
} else {
 \\ action when the prompt is not valid 
}
</code></pre>

<p>Of course this assumes you are actually trying to run the same function for each prompt. If there are only a few cases  it probably isn’t worth trying to shorten/optimize, if there are 5-10, probably a switch statement, and if there are more than 10ish there could potentially just be a better way to structure your logic so that it is more generalizable.</p>

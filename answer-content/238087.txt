<ul>
<li>The code in question is easy to read and understand. </li>
<li>You have named your variables and methods well, using the recommended naming and casing styles.</li>
<li>The code in question is well documented as well.  </li>
<li>You are using braces <code>{}</code> althought they might be optional which <strong>is good</strong> because it prevents hidden and therfor hard to find bugs.  </li>
</ul>

<p>That had been the good news about your code, now we talk about the bad news, but fortunately there aren't any, at least I don't see any.  </p>

<p>What bothers me a little and what I wouldn't do is using the <code>this</code> keyword that extensively all over the class.<br>
The <code>this</code> keyword is usually used to distinguish methods parameters from local variables/fields. One don't use it everywhere and for sure one shouldn't use it for calling methods.  </p>

<p>If you don't plan to inherit/extend this class I don't see any sense for declaring <code>elements</code> and <code>elementIndexLookup</code> as <code>protected</code>. Usually one should choose composition over inheritance.  </p>

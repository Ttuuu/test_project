<p>Disclaimer: below is just my opinion, please do not treat it as a source of truth. Also, I am assuming that the code works exactly as expected - I will not dwell into performance or vailidity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Too many comments, instead try to refactor the code to be more explanatory. Uncle Bob said it best: 'A comment is a failure to express yourself in code' (unless it's a 'why' that cannot be explained of course).</li>
<li>Devide the code to small and single responsibility functions/classes, see <a href="https://herbertograca.com/2016/09/03/clean-code-3-functions-by-robert-c-martin-uncle-bob/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> for guidance.</li>
<li>Console related operations can be delegated to a separate class (a wrapper) so it can be easily extended in the future to handle input/output from other sources. Also, in order to avoid duplication (e.g. writing <code>\n\n</code> infront of strings can be abstracted away).</li>
<li>Variable names should indicate the content (unless it's very obvious). You wrote a comment 'not the best name but ok', yes - it's not the best name but I don't think it is 'ok'. Half way through the code I had to scroll up to check what does this variable mean, this is not right.
Similar goes for variables like <code>choices1</code>, <code>digits</code>, <code>pos</code> and others.</li>
<li><code>while (done == false)</code> could be <code>while(!done)</code> it's both shorter and more explanatory 'in english'.</li>
<li>Use <code>Console.WriteLine</code> instead of adding <code>\n\n</code> (you can even do <code>Console.WriteLine("")</code>.</li>
<li>Use while loop instead of recursion for <code>Main</code>. Two reasons for that: you can exceed the stacks (unlikely for humans but any bot can do it easily) AND it would be more expected by others to see a <a href="https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2167437&amp;seqNum=2#:%7E:text=The%20game%20loop%20is%20the,again%20until%20the%20user%20quits.&amp;text=If%20a%20game%20runs%20at,completes%2060%20iterations%20every%20second." rel="nofollow noreferrer">game loop</a> rather than recursive function.</li>
<li>Display possible input values for restart, user might try <code>Y</code>, which will not work.</li>
</ul>

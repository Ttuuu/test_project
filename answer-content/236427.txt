<p>I don't know how are twitch messages formes, but here is just a quick thought after a first look at your code: regex might be helpful, especially for _parse method. It seems that there are known delimiters.
You will be able to capture all relevant data in a single match, and for example drop all of your space skipping loops.</p>

<p>You might want to take your _parse method outside of your handler class, and create a specific MessageParser class. Parsing the raw message is different from handling parsed message.</p>

<p>In the handleMessage method, there's no return for the case of a "tmi.twitch.tv" when message.command == self.COMMANDS.USERNAME, so it ends up to return(None, None). Is it wanted? All other cases return something.</p>

<p>Concerning the nested if, by now I don't see a lot of options...
However, you can use intermediate variables to have only one exit point, instead of all the returns. This will greatly help debugging by having, for example, only one breakpoint.</p>

<p>My 2 cents.</p>

<p>It's a terrible idea to use only 64 bits for a "globally unique ID". As soon as you generate <span class="math-container">\$2^{32}\$</span> IDs with that, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem#Probability_table" rel="nofollow noreferrer">probability of a collision</a> is 50 percent, and <span class="math-container">\$2^{32}\$</span> can be achieved in less than a day by a single computer.</p>

<p>I also cannot follow your reasoning:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>UUID uses 128 bits in the encoded value, and 6 of them are fixed when using random UUIDs. This means 122 random bits remain. That's not enough for me, therefore I use my own scheme that has only 64 bits of randomness.</p>

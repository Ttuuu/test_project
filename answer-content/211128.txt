<p>This only addresses one aspect of your code, but I think it's an important point to communicate:</p>

<h1>Login systems</h1>

<p>If you ever actually <em>need</em> a login system, you should investigate cybersecurity and good practices in more depth. Generally, it's advisable to use an existing reputable library or API to accomplish such a task, since it's easy to make mistakes in your own implementation.</p>

<p>Having said that, there are a few things that are easy for me to notice in your code:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/library/getpass.html#getpass.getpass" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>getpass.getpass</code></a> to prompt the password so others cannot see the entered password.</li>
<li>You should <strong>never</strong> save passwords in plaintext. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Hashing</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)" rel="nofollow noreferrer">salting</a> are standard security measures employed in all well-implemented password systems.</li>
<li>Some other things I mentioned in my comment: it would probably be better to lock-out after too many wrong attempts to prevent brute force attacks, and it should probably prevent registration passwords that have identical hashes to those released in common password data dumps. But these are even more outside of the scope of this question's implicit context.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course as @jpmc mentions, this is somewhat less relevant for this particular program, since it stores the password locally. But in general, I think starting to consider the security implications of your implementation is important, even if it's just practice.</p>

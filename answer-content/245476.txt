<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">LINQ</a> syntax:</p>
<pre><code>var studentInfo = 
    (from student in result
     select new StudentSystemRecordRequest
        {
            FirstName = student.FirstName,
            LastName = student.SurName,
            DateOfBirth = student.DateOfBirth,
            Address = student.Address1
        }
    ).ToList();
</code></pre>
<p>If you are happy with <code>IEnumerable</code> instead of <code>List</code>, you can omit <code>ToList()</code>, but keep in mind that in that case the resulting enumerable will be lazy, which means that the elements will be created only when the result is enumerated. But since <code>result</code> is probably a list, which is strict, it should not be a problem.</p>

<p>I'd recommend using the built-in <code>strftime</code> rather than defining your own list of strings:</p>

<pre><code>import datetime

date = datetime.date.today()
months = []
for _ in range (12):
    months.append(date.strftime("%b"))
    date = date.replace(month=(date.month % 12 + 1))
</code></pre>

<p>Because someone will always complain when you can't find a way to do a loop like this as a list comprehension, here's a way to do it in a single line of code with a cheesy <code>timedelta</code> (this doesn't work for arbitrarily long sequences because 30 days isn't exactly one month, but for your use case the rounding errors won't add up enough to matter):</p>

<pre><code>months = [(datetime.date.today().replace(day=15) + datetime.timedelta(days=30*n)).strftime("%b") for n in range(12)]
</code></pre>

<p>although to make this readable I think you'd want to break it up a little:</p>

<pre><code>months = [
    (datetime.date.today().replace(day=15) + 
     datetime.timedelta(days=30*n)).strftime("%b") 
     for n in range(12)
]
</code></pre>

<p>IMO the <code>for</code> loop version is cleaner.  :)</p>

<ul>
<li>avoid data type float, unless you don't care about not accurate rounding. </li>
<li>Solar_panel_rack, solar_panel and wind_turbine I would change structure:merge solar panel with solar_panel_rack if possible also would probably join wind turbine with solar panel_rack. It could potencialy have columsn like:
ItemId, ItemTypeId(wind turbine or solar), ItemName, other characteristics. 
Your current architecture would complicate future queries.</li>
<li>remove item table as it is just smaller version of wind turbine and solar panel</li>
</ul>

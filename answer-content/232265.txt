<p>A few observations, additional to the <a href="/a/232263">review by pacmaninbw</a>.</p>

<p>Headers: <code>&lt;iostream&gt;</code> isn't needed for the header, but is needed for the code.  We probably want to declare that <code>operator&lt;&lt;()</code> in the header, though - for which we should include <code>&lt;iosfwd&gt;</code>.  We also need <code>&lt;cstdint&gt;</code>, to declare <code>std::uint8_t</code>.</p>

<p>The converting constructor from <code>int</code> is a narrowing conversion, so we really ought to make that <code>explicit</code>.</p>

<p>The move constructor and move assignment operators don't add any value, unless there's a demonstrated need to zero the source.  I believe they should be omitted.</p>

<p>The destructor adds no value at all, and should be omitted.</p>

<p>Conversion to <code>bool</code> isn't necessary, as there's a conversion to <code>int</code>, and <code>int</code> implicitly converts to <code>bool</code>.</p>

<p>Conversion to <code>std::uint8_t</code> could be simplified:</p>

<pre><code>operator std::uint8_t()
{
    return 0x80 * b7 + 0x40 * b6 + 0x20 * b5 + 0x10 * b4
        +  0x08 * b3 + 0x04 * b2 + 0x02 * b1 + 0x01 * b0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The streaming operator will produce different results depending on whether the stream has <code>std::boolalpha</code> set or not.  Is that desirable?</p>

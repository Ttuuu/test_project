<p>In the comments to your other questions some things were mentioned that are also applicable to this question as well, like:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Try to follow <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP 8</a> style guide.</p></li>
<li><p>Single letter names should be avoided.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid useless comments, make your code self explanatory.</p></li>
<li><p>Check for invalid input, raise exceptions.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now, you have some <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47882/what-is-a-magic-number-and-why-is-it-bad">magic numbers</a> like <code>12</code>, <code>100</code> and <code>4</code>. Give them names. Make them constants. Don't leave them like that.  </p>

<p>Some prints don't make a lot of sense, like printing type of <code>R</code> or printing if duration is in years or in months. That looks more like information for debugging. I suggest you to take a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#logging-basic-tutorial" rel="nofollow noreferrer">logging</a> module and give it a try. But for such a small program it is probably an overkill.  </p>

<p>This <code>n = d[0:(len(d)-1)]</code> is repeated twice in your code and it can be taken out of that <code>if-elif</code> statement. Moreover it can be simplified as <code>n = d[:-1]</code>. </p>

<p>Instead of writing  </p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>EMI = x*(P*r*(1+r)**m)//((1+r)**m - 1)
return EMI
</code></pre>

<p>you can write just</p>

<pre><code>return x*(P*r*(1+r)**m)//((1+r)**m - 1)
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, wrap your <code>print EMI_calculator(10000,12,'Q','3Y')</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code>if __name__ == '__main__':
    print EMI_calculator(10000, 12, 'Q', '3Y')
</code></pre>

<p>First, as dnoeth commented, why are you doing this job in mass rather than calculating on the fly? You might have a good reason, but you never clarified.  Of course the best way to lighten the load would be not to do this task at all.</p>

<p>Second, as 200_success commented, you are damaging your database design by writing age data into a birth_year column.</p>

<p>If you MUST run this procedure and you MUST overwrite the <code>birth_year</code>, then I have some advice for your single-query approach:</p>

<ol>
<li>You should consistently use all caps when writing mysql keywords and functions for readability.</li>
<li>You should try to minimize the number function calls and overall length of your query.</li>
<li>Because, I assume, you have covered all potential outcomes with your table data in your CASE conditions, there should be no logical requirement for the <code>null</code> outcome.  Furthermore, because there are only 2 outcomes, I would opt for an <code>IF</code> statement rather than the more verbose <code>CASE</code> statement.</li>
<li>Depending on the possibility of a null value in <code>birth_year</code>, you may need to include another <code>IF</code> or <code>COALESCE</code> call to mitigate that data challenge.</li>
</ol>

<p>SQL (D.R.Y.):</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE table_name
SET birth_year = YEAR(GETDATE()) - birth_year - IF(birth_month IS NULL OR birth_month &lt;= MONTH(GETDATE()), 0, 1) 
FROM table_name
</code></pre>

<p>You handled a case that your scenario didn't ask you to support. Usually, this is something you want to avoid. Stick to the requirements! If your <code>position &gt; size of linked list</code>, you decided to add that element at the end of the list. But is this really the wanted behavior? You should consider throwing an exception instead. Think about it : </p>

<pre><code>//That's gonna be C#'s syntax, I'm not sure if it's exactly the same in java
//But you'll understand :p
int[] array = new int[2];
array[3] = 1;
</code></pre>

<p>What do you usually expect? An <code>exception</code>, or that <code>array[2] = 1</code>? </p>

<p>The thing is, if a user of your method inputs something, they want <em>exactly</em> that to be done, not a fallback scenario. Let the user know it didn't work, it's better this way.</p>

<p>Don't think about recursion, your <code>while</code> loop is a very good way to tackle this problem. Recursion has no easy way in this problem I think. I think your solution is very fine.</p>

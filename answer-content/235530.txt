<p>Bug: When you feed an empty file to your program, it ends up in an endless loop.</p>

<p>Bug: the 24th letter of the English alphabet is X, not S.</p>

<p>Instead of <code>const char *</code> you should rather declare <code>const char alphabet[]</code>, to make the code match the comment above it. Don't confuse strings and pointers to strings. The <a href="https://github.com/cs50/libcs50/issues/163" rel="noreferrer">authors of the cs50 library do that</a>, and they do much damage to the thousands of students who trust in them.</p>

<p>Your code repeats in many places. Instead of using <code>if (map.containsKey)</code>, you should make good use of <code>Map.getOrDefault</code>:</p>

<pre><code>map.put(key, j + map.getOrDefault(key, 0));
</code></pre>

<p>That way you can convert many five-liners into one-liners.</p>

<p>Instead of the <code>&lt;</code> operator just use <code>Math.max</code>, which leads to shorter code as well.</p>

<p>I don't understand the formatting of the code, especially why the methods are indented by 11 spaces. If there's no hidden meaning to it, let your IDE or editor format the code automatically.</p>

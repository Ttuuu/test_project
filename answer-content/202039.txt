<p>For the suggested use case having an object is an overkill.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell from the code provided, every link is generated only once, which makes class variables; a dedicated method to clean the state; and a code to instantiate an object all unnecessary. So a function would be more appropriate here. </p>

<p>Besides, as it seems that a code is more intended to create an HTML <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag dynamically than to create an URL, and also in order to follow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Single responsibility principle</a>, I would change the list of parameters to just </p>

<pre><code>hLink('http://example.com/?input=0#section', 'website', '_blank'); 
</code></pre>

<p>which will make parameters more sensible and consistent.</p>

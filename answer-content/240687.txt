<p>Are you using a ORM like Entity framework? If so use navigation properties and let it resolve the dependencies for you.</p>

<pre><code>UnitOfWork.Save();
</code></pre>

<p>This is a bad design to define unit of work. There are no clear boundries that are enforced.  Plus not much Unit of work if you commit for each child at the lowest level.</p>

<p>Hope that can give you some pointers.</p>

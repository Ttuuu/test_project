<p>Actually you found an example where looping over indices is ok. What you messed up is the search for the right end. When doing slicing the second value is not included <code>'abc[0:2]</code>gives <code>'ab'</code>. So your <code>right</code> shall be past the last included character, that is the next uppercase one. We rewrite the second loop to follow the style of the first one</p>

<pre><code>for i in range(index+1, len(s)):
    if s[i].isupper():
        right = i
        break
else:
    right = len(s)
</code></pre>

<p>and return the slice</p>

<pre><code>return s[left:right]
</code></pre>

<p>That is IMHO also the most readable solution following the KISS principle (and some python Zen)</p>

<p>Unfortunately you're using django&lt;2.2, since from 2.2 onwards you can use <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/models/querysets/#bulk-update" rel="nofollow noreferrer">bulk_update</a> , but you can still use something like</p>

<pre><code>ParticipationCount.objects.all().update(
    people=F("male") + F("female")
)
</code></pre>

<p>Which will do it in one query to save time. This will fail for certain fields in Postgres however as it requires some specific type casting, but this can be done within the query</p>

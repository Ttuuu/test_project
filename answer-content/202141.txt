<p>1e9 is only 1 billion, which will fit into a standard integer range of 2 billion some.</p>

<p>The <code>hcf</code> function is unexpected, because it's just a wrapper for <code>BigInteger</code>. I think just using the built in GCD function would be better than making your own method that calls a standard function. If it's critical to the algorithm understanding that we think of a highest common factor instead of a greatest common denominator, then keep the function. If you do keep it, though, use the full name instead of an abbreviation i.e. <code>private BigInteger highestCommonFactor</code>.</p>

<p>I looked at your code and expected to see a loop. I'm assuming you've worked out the math to do this without loops, which is good and probably more efficient. But, I don't really know how this would work, and would be worried someone else looking at the code would have the same problem. A code comment indicating what mathematical principles, or even the name of a theorem, would help immensely.</p>

<p>This was a short-lived project. I had to abandon this approach because it is not possible to chain <code>JsonTextReader</code>s. They do not support the decorator pattern or cannot be connected in any other way so one reader cannot work with the result of the previous one.</p>

<p>I discovered this disadvanted when I wanted to add another module for validating or fixing property names (e.g. beginning or ending with a whitespace).</p>

<p>Instead, I now use <code>JToken.Parse</code> and my <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/208641/chaining-json-transformations-with-visitors"><code>JsonVisitor</code></a> to modify the tree and one of them still uses the <code>PrettyTypeExpander</code> under the hood.</p>

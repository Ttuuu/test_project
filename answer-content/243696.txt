<p>Three observations:</p>
<ol>
<li>There are two many <code>assert</code> statements in a single test function. Ideally each function should only test one thing. That way when the test fails you know exactly what is wrong.</li>
<li>Instead of initializing test data in the test function, you can write <code>fixtures</code>. Each fixture can be used in multiple test functions.</li>
<li>You don't need to <code>assert 'KeyError' in str(excinfo.type)</code> since you already has <code>with pytest.raises(KeyError)</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Just a few things I noticed.</p>

<h1>Utilize built in functions</h1>

<p>This</p>

<pre><code>S = 0
for k in range(1, N):
    S += function[a + k * h]
</code></pre>

<p>can be this</p>

<pre><code>S = sum(function[a + k * h] for k in range(1, N))
</code></pre>

<p>Python3's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sum" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>sum</code></a> takes an iterable, and returns the sum of all the values in that iterable. So, you can pass in the <code>for</code> loop and it will return the sum for you. Looks neater, too.</p>

<h1>Operator Spacing</h1>

<p>There should be a space before and after every operator and equal sign. Here's an example from your code:</p>

<pre><code>d = 1/2 * h * (function[a + k*h] + function[a + (k+1) * h])
</code></pre>

<p>This should be </p>

<pre><code>d = 1/2 * h * (function[a + k * h] + function[a + (k + 1) * h])
</code></pre>

<p>Spacing just helps you and other programmers read your code.</p>

<p>This, however, doesn't apply when <em>passing default parameters</em>. Have a look:</p>

<pre><code>plot(time, distance, "g--", label = "position") # WRONG
plot(time, distance, "g--", label="position") # RIGHT
</code></pre>

<h1>Variable Naming</h1>

<p>A lot of single character variable names can confuse you, and make a program hard to read. I see you have comments such as <code>#x_initial</code> and <code>#x_final</code>. Why not use those as variable names? They're a lot more concise than <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. <code>h</code> can also be something like <code>diff</code>.</p>

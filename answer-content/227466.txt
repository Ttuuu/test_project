<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>I improved the performances (and simplicity) like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-rust prettyprint-override"><code>use std::fs::File;
use std::io::Write;
use std::io::BufWriter;

const N: i32 = 1e7 as i32;

fn main() {
    let mut f = BufWriter::new(File::create("numbers.txt").expect("Unable to create file"));
    for i in 1..=N  {
        write!(f, "{0}\n", i);
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>I just don't store the strings in a gigantic buffer but asks the BufWriter to manage the buffering. As a side effect, it's now possible to write bigger files without holding too much RAM.</p>

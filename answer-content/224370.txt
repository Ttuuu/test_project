<p>I have a few suggestions for you:</p>

<ul>
<li>You should get in the habit on wrapping all code that isn't in a function in a main guard, to ensure that that code only runs if that file is running, and to protect it from import mishaps</li>
<li>Running your code with <code>pylint</code>, a few warnings that popped up were:

<ul>
<li>Returns: All return statements should return something or none of them should return anything. Since you are returning <code>permutations</code>, the other <code>return</code>'s should just return None.</li>
<li>Module Docstring: Your function should contain a docstring describing what the function does, even if it's very obvious. These will help any documentation.</li>
<li>Constant variable names: Since the three variables in the main guard do not change, they should be in all <code>UPPERCASE</code> to make it clear that they are constants.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Refactored code:</p>

<pre><code>def valid_moves(position, target, legal, path, permutations):
    """ Returns unique ways to climb a staircase with passed length `target` """
    if position &gt; target:
        return None
    if position == target:
        permutations.append(path)
        return None
    for move in legal:
        valid_moves(position + move, target, legal, path + [move], permutations)
    return permutations

if __name__ == '__main__':
    START = 0
    STAIRCASE_LENGTH = 3
    LEGAL_MOVES = [1, 2]

    print(*valid_moves(START, STAIRCASE_LENGTH, LEGAL_MOVES, [], []), sep="\n")
</code></pre>

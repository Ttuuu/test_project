<p>There's really not much you can improve.  My follow up question would be where and how did you decide on your breakpoints?</p>

<p>I suggest using a bit more standardized sizes; the ones I pasted below are directly from the Bootstrap 4 Template <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/layout/overview/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/layout/overview/</a></p>

<p>You <strong>do not</strong> need all 4 sizes, but these are a bit more <em>standard</em> (even though there's a bajillion different sizes, these are most common)</p>

<pre><code>// Small devices (landscape phones, 576px and up)
@media (min-width: 576px) { ... }

// Medium devices (tablets, 768px and up)
@media (min-width: 768px) { ... }

// Large devices (desktops, 992px and up)
@media (min-width: 992px) { ... }

// Extra large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up)
@media (min-width: 1200px) { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>And maybe some general clean up. For example right now you have:</p>

<h2>Current</h2>

<pre><code>    form .row section {
        margin: 0.5rem 0;
    }
    #eating-habits {
        margin: 0.5rem 0;
    }
</code></pre>

<h2>Revised</h2>

<pre><code>#eating-habits, form .row section{
    margin: 0.5rem 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Keep all the same style in one block.  So if there are a bunch of things that have the exact same property and value, put them in a single block.  I usually do ID's then class (alphabetical).  And same with the properties themselves as mentioned by Dennis.</p>

<h2>Reason</h2>

<p>Lets say you have 50 elements, and they all need to <code>display:block</code> . Its much quicker to write that out once, and attach all the classes and ID's to that property, than the inverse.  If you look at most CSS frameworks you'll find them written in this fashion.</p>

<p>Otherwise great work! :)</p>

<p>Java uses camelCasing. Every word after the first (or including the first if it's a class name) should be a capital. This make names easier to read, since it's clearer where the words start and end. All your names should follow this convention. For example: <code>getSuccessor</code> and <code>getNode</code>. You use proper camel casing in a couple places, but you're inconsistent.</p>

<p>Be more careful with your spacing.</p>

<pre><code>while (currentnode!=null &amp;&amp; 0!= compare(currentnode,node)) {
</code></pre>

<p>has a lot of inconsistent style that's making it harder to read than necessary. Putting spaces around operators is the cleanest way to go in my opinion. I also prefer to add spaces after commas:</p>

<pre><code>while (currentnode != null &amp;&amp; 0 != compare(currentnode, node)) {
</code></pre>

<p>Just be consistent.</p>

<p>While your indentation for <code>containsElement</code> is poor, the idea behind the function is good. You've put most of the logic away in a general function <code>contains</code> that could be reused elsewhere if needed, then just delegate to it in <code>containsElement</code>. This is much better than the alternative of duplicating logic.</p>

<p>Overall, there's nothing glaringly wrong with your logic, but your code is quite messy. You should practice making sure that your code is readable, for your own and other's sake. Have more consistent spacing after methods and <code>if</code> lines, ensure that your indentation is correct, and make sure your spacing around operators is less haphazard. Ideally, I should be able to glance at your code and "break it down" in my head easily using spacing alone. That's not as possible when there isn't a convention that can be relied on.</p>

<p>The other answers do a good job of analyzing the code, but they miss the most obvious point.  Don't write parsers in C++, or C for that matter.  Use (f)lex if the input is reasonably simple, flex + yacc/bison if it's complicated.  Or possibly some other toolset designed for the job, but these are the most common.  Your input is simple enough for a standalone flex analyzer.</p>

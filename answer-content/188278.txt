<p>So this solution works: </p>

<pre><code>x = load('data.csv');
windowSize = 10; 
b = (1/windowSize)*ones(1,windowSize);
i = 1;

for n = windowSize: length(x)
    m = 0;
    tempSum = 0;
        for j = 1 : windowSize
            temp = b(j)*x(n-m);
            tempSum = tempSum + temp;
            m = m + 1;
        end
    y(i,:) = [tempSum]
    i = i+1;
end
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of having really inaccurate results in the beginning I just skip these. It's important to note that you are losing an amount of samples equal to the number of b coefficients in this solution. So make sure to rescale the X-axis. </p>

<p>Results were compared using Matlabs C = setdiff(y,yy) function and found no difference between the proposed solution and Matlabs filter(b,a,x) function. </p>

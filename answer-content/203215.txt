<p>I wouldn't talk too much on on the rest of your code but your <code>userLogin()</code> and <code>Register()</code> function does not belong to your user class..</p>

<p>In short note a user class should be something like..</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
    class user(){
       //user property/profile
       protected $username;
       protected Lang = lang;

        //user behaviour
         public change_password();
         public change_lang();
         private setup();
         protected addLang();
         public getLang;
     };
</code></pre>

<p>Object are supposed to be used for namespacing and dealing with data. Your above class contains functions not related to data for  users class.</p>

<p><code>register()</code> primarily uses data supplied data  users form input which is irrelevant to user class that gets it data from database using session, username from login etc.</p>

<p>Better approach is </p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
    class Register{
        //register data gotten from input
        //validate input
        //submit to database and send.
        //email verification messages
    }
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Do same thing for user login.... Infact User login do not need to be a class nor a function but you could create a <strong>Validator class</strong> instead, I advise you should use procedural.</p>

<p>Before you do OOP or build class. Think of the data you wil need to work on... Ask what are it behaviours.</p>

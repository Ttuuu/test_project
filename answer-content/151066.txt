<p>A streaming protocol has no concept of a message. <code>recv</code> may receive any amount of data, which leads to two unpleasant scenarios:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>a terminating byte is not (yet) received. <code>printf</code> prints whatever garbage is in the buffer (maybe leftovers from previous receives, maybe uninitialized data). Technically UB (undefined behavior).</p></li>
<li><p><code>recv</code> gets two messages in a single go. <code>printf</code> prints the first one, and the second is lost forever.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Similarly, <code>send</code> is not guaranteed to send an entire amount.</p>

<p>It is very important to see how much data has been sent/received (both functions return this information), and account for incomplete transactions.</p>

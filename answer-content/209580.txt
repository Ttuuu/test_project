<ul>
<li><p>Three calls to <code>memcpy</code> seem to emulate <code>sprintf(program_path, "%s/%s", dir, buffer);</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>my_strtok</code> is a not very clean substitute for <code>dirname</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The lock file is always created in the home directory, and only accounts for the base name of the executable. It means that <code>/usr/foo</code> would block <code>/opt/foo</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The locker does not account for the links (again, it only cares about the base name of the executable). Different names may refer to the physically same file; invocations via links would not lock each other out.</p></li>
<li><p>A callback registered with <code>atexit</code> is only guaranteed to be called if the program exits normally. If the program is terminated by the signal, the lock file would not be removed.</p></li>

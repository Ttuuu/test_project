<p>I'm wondering why are you using an array to store your input in, this a bit of overkill if you only need to have the sum and the average, you can store this in 3 variables.
Have a look at this. </p>

<p>It shows how to handle the user canceling the console as well as eliminating the need for an array or list. You can still break when it has reached 5 entries by limiting the tries or limiting the successful conversions. </p>

<p>If the user makes a mistake it is normally a good idea to show him what he typed else he is confused and was sure what he typed was "correct ish"</p>

<pre><code>public static void Main()

{

    int sum = 0;
    bool error = false;
    int count = 0;
    bool canceled = false;
    var track = new StringBuilder();
    track.Append("Your typed in values: ");
    Console.CancelKeyPress += (s, e) =&gt; canceled = true;

    (int left, int top) = (Console.CursorLeft, Console.CursorTop);
    Console.WriteLine("Please write a number, press CTL + C to cancel:");

    do
    {
        var userData = Console.ReadLine();
        Console.SetCursorPosition(left, top);
        if (!canceled &amp;&amp; int.TryParse(userData, out int input))
        {
            count++;
            sum += input;   
            if(count&gt;1)
                Console.WriteLine(track.Append(","));

            //clear as the user can endless type values
            Console.Clear();
            Console.WriteLine("Please write a number, press CTL + C to cancel:");
            Console.WriteLine(track.Append(userData));
        }
        else
        {

            Console.WriteLine($"Sorry could not convert {userData} to an integer press CTL + C to cancel to cancel or try again".PadRight(Console.BufferWidth,' '));

        }

    } while (!canceled &amp;&amp; !error);



                Console.WriteLine("");

    Console.WriteLine("The result of your numbers:");
    Console.WriteLine(sum);

    Console.WriteLine("The average of your numbers:");
    Console.WriteLine((double)sum / (double)count);

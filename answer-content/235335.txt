<p>You say your file contains integers only. Yet your parsing code calls <code>trim_lower</code>, which doesn't make sense at all.</p>

<p>At least I hope you implemented <code>tolower</code> other than in the C++ standard library, since the latter must not be called with <code>signed char</code> or <code>char</code> as argument.</p>

<p>The <code>proc_words</code> function creates lots of <code>std::string</code> objects internally, which is unnecessary. No wonder your code takes so long. Since numbers are not words, you are using the completely wrong tool for this job. You should rather define <code>for_each_token</code> instead of <code>proc_words</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>isnumeric</code> function is inappropriate as well. You need <code>isdigit</code> here.</p>

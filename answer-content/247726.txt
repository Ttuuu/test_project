<p>Not too much to say on style, it all reads well to me. That said, there are a couple things I'd change.</p>
<p>You can get away with <code>_dict</code> as a field here but I think <code>_bookings</code> would be slightly nicer.</p>
<p>You can simplify the dictionary access too:</p>
<pre><code>if(!_dict.TryGetValue(start, out var temp))
{
    _dict.Add(start, temp + 1);
}
else
{
    _dict[start]++;
}
</code></pre>
<p>I believe you could do:</p>
<pre><code>var existingCount = _bookings.TryGetValue(start, out var count) ? count : 0;
_bookings[start] = existingCount + 1;
</code></pre>
<p>You could also filter your list when you iterate. Once you get to the end of the booking you're currently looking at, you don't need to keep going.</p>
<pre><code>foreach (var d in _bookings.TakeWhile(kvp =&gt; kvp.Key &lt; end).Select(kvp =&gt; kvp.Value))
</code></pre>
<p>It would be nice if you didn't have to add the start and end in to the dictionary but it does seem to be the simplest solution here. This can be a dangerous strategy because you have to ensure the entries you've added are always removed but I can't see any way your code can throw in the loop.</p>

<p>I was looking at a method which I considered to be really easy: <code>c_str</code>, however, it doesn't look that easy based on how you implemented it.</p>

<p>Currently, you have a bool indicating whether you should store it on the heap or not. If you replace that by a pointer to the first character. You could implement the <code>onHeap</code> by comparing 2 pointers. Every access to the characters can simply use the pointer, unless for the appending.</p>

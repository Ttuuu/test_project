<p>Here's the thing: you should probably store all of these elements in a file of some sort (say <code>elements.txt</code>). The format of the file can be as follows:</p>

<pre><code>Hydrogen Element: Hydrogen  Symbol: H  Atomic Number: 1  Atomic Mass: 1  Group: Non Metals
Helium Element: Helium  Symbol: He  Atomic Number: 2  Atomic Mass: 4  Group: Noble Gases
...
</code></pre>

<p>Now, in your Python code, you can change your code so that it reads from this file at startup i.e:</p>

<pre><code>with open("elements.txt") as f:
    all_lines = f.read().splitlines()
    elements = []
    for line in all_lines:
        elements.append((line.split()[0], line[line.find(" "):].strip()))
        # Create a list of tuples with the first part the name of the element,
        # the second part its info.
</code></pre>

<p>Now that you have a list of elements, you can then significantly shorten the rest of your code to something that uses a loop to iterate over your elements in order to determine whether the input (or its first letter) matches any of them.</p>

<p>If you want to make it easier to change output formatting, I would even recommend that you go as far as using a JSON file instead of a text one.</p>

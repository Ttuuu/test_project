<p>Since this is an <a href="/questions/tagged/interview-question" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'interview-question'" rel="tag">interview-question</a> here's how I see it.</p>

<p>I'd accept your code for a position of a <em>junior-developer</em> without much criticism but I would reject it for anything higher than that.</p>

<p>If you were applying for a <em>senior-developer</em> position then I'm of a quite different opinion than @VisualMelon. The methods don't make a good impression on me because they do too much. Your task is to remove an item but what you are doing is not only that. You are also searching for it. The searching part should be moved to its own method. I also find the variable names should not be abbreviated and instead you should use full words like <code>current</code> and <code>previous</code>. I agree with other suggestions by @VisualMelon.</p>

<p><strong>Visibility:</strong> I find the visibility of your variables strange. Why is "buckets" a package protected variable in your HashMap class? Do you need to use it outside of the class in the package? Your code doesn't indicate that, so it should be private. Same with LinkedList.head.</p>

<p>Additionally, why are the constructors package private? I assume your IDE gave you that tip because your main method lies in the same package, but you should ignore that. Make them public.</p>

<p><strong>Node.next:</strong> Your HashMap returns Nodes and those Nodes have a public getter and setter for the next variable. Using them, one can get a node, set another next and mutate the HashMap from outside. That's certainly not what you (should) want. "getNext" and "setNext" should be package private and your main method should be outside the package to demonstrate that you really understand that these methods shouldn't be accessed by the client. I guess that's what vnp meant.</p>

<p><strong>Node&lt;K, V&gt;:</strong> As Serverfrog mentioned, your returns miss the generic type information for Node. Imagine you create a HashMap with a String key and integer values. Now you want to find a certain integer and multiply it by two. The problem with this is that your HashMap returns a Node which doesn't know which types are stored in it. So it gives you the value as an Object. Now you have to cast it just because you forgot to add &lt;K, V&gt; to your return type.</p>

<p>I use <code>var</code> almost everywhere.  To me, it makes the code more concise and easier to refactor.  Essentially, unless it makes the code harder to read / understand I use it.  An important element of this is variable naming.  For example:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>boolean res = false;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p><code>res</code> probably means result, why not call it that... or better still, what it's represents the result of:</p>

<pre><code>var saved = false;
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, <code>rset</code> could be <code>resultSet</code> or <code>rows</code>.  It's also fairly out of fashion to include variable types in variable names, so rather than <code>strQuery</code>, you probably want to just go with <code>query</code>.</p>

<p>It's been a while since I used this type of connection, however result sets often need to be cleaned up after you're done with them.  It looks like there's a close method on it, so you might want to wrap it in a try with resources block as well...</p>

<pre><code>try(var rows = statement.executeQuery(query)) {
</code></pre>
    </div>

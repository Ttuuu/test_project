<p>Some changes I've made prompted by the style guide (<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide</a>):</p>

<ul>
<li>my docstrings were in the wrong place! They should be before the args [].</li>
<li>replaced <code>validate-cell</code> (which was a function running through a bunch of <code>asserts</code>) with <code>{:pre [(valid-cell? grid start) (valid-cell? grid dest)]}</code>, which gives better error messages.</li>
<li>replaced <code>map #(% :cell)</code> with just <code>map :cell</code> since it's a function when applied to maps</li>
</ul>

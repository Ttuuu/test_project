<p>Unwrapping options is probably fine for this simple little app that only you’re using, but it dumps out a panic if the result is <code>None</code>. I like your use of <code>expect</code> better. That can give a nicer error message to the user. Either way, it’d be good to learn the more idiomatic way of dealing with options. </p>

<pre><code>match x {
    None =&gt; foo,
    Some =&gt; bar
}
</code></pre>

<p>The function at the end of your file should probably be returning an <code>Option</code> that can be handled in your main logic. </p>

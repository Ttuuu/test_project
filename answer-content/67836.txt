<ul>
<li><code>UserNumber</code> shouldn't be capitalized, it's not class.</li>
<li><p>Just for readability sake I'll consider defining constants instead of magic numbers</p>

<pre><code>#define FORBIDDEN_INPUT 5
#define MAX_ATTEMPTS 10
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>k</code> may be better named (maybe <code>attempt</code>)?</p></li>
<li>I don't like empty line in if-else statement, I want to know that they should be read together, and I know that, when they are close to each other vertically.</li>
</ul>

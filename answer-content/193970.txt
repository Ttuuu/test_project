<p>I think a problem you might have is that you have this in <code>Worksheet_Calculate</code> <em>and</em> you set your <code>Application.Calculation</code> to automatic -</p>

<pre><code>Private Sub Worksheet_Calculate()
...
Application.Calculation = xlCalculationAutomatic
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>You are applying <em>all</em> of these filters <em>every time</em> anything calculates on whatever sheet this is on. Do you need that? I doubt it - maybe set your sheet to manual calculation or move the event out of the calculate event and set up a button or something.</p>

<hr>

<p>When you declare variables, you need to give them all a <em>type</em> -</p>

<pre><code>Dim DivRef, RegRef, DistRef, ZoneRef As String
</code></pre>

<p>This declares <code>DivRef</code>, <code>RegRef</code> and <code>DistRef</code> as <em>Variant</em> and only <code>ZoneRef</code> as string. Variants <em>can</em> slow down your code, but I doubt that's really the problem here. It's good practice, however, to always type them. You need to type <em>each one</em> e.g.</p>

<pre><code>Dim divRef as String, regRef as String, distRef as String, zoneRef as String
</code></pre>

<p>Or more appropriately-</p>

<pre><code>Dim division As String
Dim region As String
Dim district As String
</code></pre>

<p>I don't see you using <code>zone</code> so I didn't include it.</p>

<p>I also changed the naming, you want your names to be clear and concise.</p>

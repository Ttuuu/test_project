<h2>Don't Repeat Yourself</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://deviq.com/don-t-repeat-yourself/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">D.R.Y. principle</a> is a fundamental principle in programming. Anytime logic is repeated more than once, it should be abstracted. For example, the first three variable assignments contain the same ternary operation:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>(isset($_SERVER['HTTPS']) &amp;&amp; $_SERVER['HTTPS'] === 'on' ? "https" : "http")
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>That could be put into a function:</p>
<pre><code>function GetProtocol() {
    return isset($_SERVER['HTTPS']) &amp;&amp; $_SERVER['HTTPS'] === 'on' ? "https" : "http";
}
</code></pre>
<p>That way if any of that logic needed to be updated, it could be changed in once place instead of three. The <code>HTTP_HOST</code> could also be included in that function - in that case, a name of <code>GetProtocolAndDomain</code> would be appropriate.</p>
<p>Like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/51749089/1575353">Peter's answer on SO</a> mentions- the function <code>sp_custom_notice()</code> can be declared once, since the only difference between the two definitions appears to be the last line - where the first argument passed is <code>'free shipping for $40 &amp; under'</code> in the first case and the first argument is <code>' free shipping for $40 &amp; under'</code> in the second case. There isn't really a need for a space in the second case?</p>
<p>Peter also claims the first three variables are not necessary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Firstly, you don't need the 3 <code>$*_link</code> variables as WooCommerce has 2 conditionals - <code>is_shop()</code> and <code>is_cart()</code> to check if you're on a shop page or a cart page. Also, the <code>, $shop_link</code> &amp; <code>, $cart_link</code> in the <code>setcookie</code>s aren't required, so you can safely get rid of them.<sup><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/51749089/1575353">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes sense, since you can have the cookies available for all pages on the domain instead of just a single page. In the event that <code>is_shop()</code> and <code>is_cart()</code> weren't available, you could compare the last 5 characters of <code>$_SERVER[REQUEST_URI]</code> with <code>cart/</code> or <code>shop/</code> using <a href="http://php.net/substr" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>substr()</code></a> with <code>-5</code> as the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.substr.php#refsect1-function.substr-parameters" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>start</code></a> parameter.</p>
<h3>Threshold constant</h3>
<p>It appears that the value for <code>$free_shipping_threshold</code> doesn't change. Because of this, it can be made a constant at the top of the file:</p>
<pre><code>const FREE_SHIPPING_CONSTANT = 40;
</code></pre>
<p>Then that constant can be used in the <code>sp_custom_notice</code> function, and if that value needed to be updated, you could just look at the top of the file for the line to change.</p>
<h2>Erroneous Line</h2>
<p>I see the following line in your post:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>$first_time_shop = true;&lt;br&gt;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Did you manually add the HTML break tag (i.e. <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>) when posting here? I would expect that if that was actually in your code then the PHP interpreter would thrown an error.</p>

<p>First I'd like to call out the good things that you've done:</p>

<ul>
<li>Writing functions, including a standard <code>main()</code>.</li>
<li>Having more or less sensible function and variable names.</li>
<li>Proper use of <code>with</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>An improvement here is to stop parsing the file yourself, and to start parsing it with Python's native <code>csv</code> library. Even though your format is <em>not</em> technically CSV (it's separated by semicolon), you can still configure <code>csv</code> to use a different delimiter.</p>

<p><s>I recommend the use of the <code>DictReader</code> class.</s> Given that you only pay attention to one variable, just use <code>csv.reader</code>. During initialization, get the index of the column you want, and then use that on every record that the reader gives back.</p>

<p>The critical performance issue here is that you have nested loops for row comparison. Given that you are comparing two series expected to be in the same order, but with edits (insertions and deletions), effectively you're doing a diff. Read this for a nice walkthrough.</p>

<p>Your solution is O(N^2 log N) if I understand correctly. </p>

<p>I propose a solution that works in O(N log N): </p>

<ol>
<li>Represent each word by dictionary where the key is character and value is the count of it inside the word. Equal dictionaries will have the same count for all characters. </li>
<li>Sort the list of dictionaries by its hash (you need to implement it) .</li>
<li>Equal dictionaries will be adjacent to each other. So you can remove equal dictionaries in 1 pass. </li>
</ol>

<p>Some suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your code is non-reentrant; that is, it can't be called by more than one user at a time due to the global LEAF. Don't have that as a global. It should be passed into your functions, either as a member of a struct if appropriate, or a separate argument.</li>
<li>Use <code>typedef</code> so that you don't have to write <code>struct node</code> 100 times.</li>
<li>Use <code>const</code> where appropriate. If you're not modifying an argument, e.g. in functions like <code>parent</code>, make the arg <code>const</code>.</li>
<li><code>if (p != NULL)</code> can be written <code>if (p)</code>. <code>if (p == NULL)</code> can be written <code>if (!p)</code>.</li>
<li>Resist the 1980s temptation to declare all of your variables at the top. Declare them where they're used, especially for cases like this -</li>
</ul>

<p>Your loop</p>

<pre><code>int T = 1000000000; 
....
while (T-- &gt; 0) {
</code></pre>

<p>can be written as</p>

<pre><code>for (int T = 1000000000; T &gt; 0; T--)
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>It's good to have tests. It's better to have automated tests. Think about replacing your "interactive" test function with a series of tests that try out various features in your code and apply asserts.</li>
</ul>

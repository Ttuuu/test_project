<p>You should ensure that the file is closed. In addition you should avoid creating a new writer object every loop iteration using the <code>with</code> statement:</p>

<pre><code>class GetInfoSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = "infrarail"
    start_urls= ['http://www.infrarail.com/2018/exhibitor-profile/?e={}'.format(page) for page in range(65,70)]
    output = "output.csv"

    def __init__(self):
        # empty outputfile
        open(self.output, "w").close()
        # alternative:
        # if os.path.isfile(self.output):
        #     os.remove(self.output)

    def parse(self, response):
        with open(self.output, "a", newline="") as f:
            writer = csv.writer(f)
            for q in response.css("article.contentslim"):
                name = q.css("h1::text").extract_first()
                link = q.css("p a::attr(href)").extract_first()
                writer.writerow([name, link])
                yield {'Name': name, 'Link': link}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I also added some spaces after commas to improve readability, according to Python's official style-guide, <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP8</a>.</p>

<p>It also recommends only importing from one module per line (so while <code>from random import rand, randint</code> is fine, <code>import scrapy, csv</code> is not).</p>

<p>Also note that each item is only written to file when the next one is being requested, as a generator pauses after the <code>yield</code>. That means if you for example <code>itertools.islice</code> it, your last item won't be written to the file. Therefore I swapped those two lines.</p>

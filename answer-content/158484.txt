<p>Here some comments about your code:</p>

<hr>

<ol>
<li><p>You should never compare Strings by using <strong>==</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>if( sp.commandType() == "A_COMMAND" ) 
</code></pre>

<p>This might work for constant Strings if the compiler pools the constants but this is not guaranteed. So use <em>.equals(..)</em> instead</p></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<ol start="2">
<li>You should use an <em>Enum</em> for <em>L_COMMAND A_COMMAND C_COMMAND</em>. This way you gain type safety and also speed because Enums are mapped to <em>int</em> by the compiler which makes comparisons very cheap.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<ol start="3">
<li>You use <strong>.replaceAll</strong> a lot during parsing. This results in creating new String instances and always iterating through the String. If speed is you goal you should try to avoid to modify the <em>line</em> during parsing. 
A better way would be to only read the source and generate a data structure while parsing it (often done by a tokenizer and creating a abstract syntax tree). Another benefit would be that you can always say where in the original line you are when a parsing problem occurs because you never modified the line. </li>

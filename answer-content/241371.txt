<p>Your second version is better than your first version, for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>All else being equal, building a new list is IMO easier to reason about than changing a list you're iterating over.</li>
<li>You're iterating using <code>for...in</code> rather than iterating by index using a range (and the range in your first example is hardcoded rather than being over the <code>len</code> of the list, which is doubly bad).</li>
</ol>

<p>The most efficient/pythonic way is to use the comprehension syntax:</p>

<pre><code>currentUsersLower = [user.lower() for user in currentUsers]
</code></pre>

<p>(Also, standard Python style would be to name these <code>current_users</code> and <code>current_users_lower</code>!)</p>

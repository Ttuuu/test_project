<p>Wow. Just reading through the first couple of lines got me wondering:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why the late-binding?</li>
<li>Why use a regex at all?</li>
</ul>

<p>@ckuhn203 already addressed the naming in his answer, but I find this:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>Dim i As Integer
For i = 1 To 10 'let's say there is 10 rows
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Turned into that:</p>

<pre><code>Dim row As Integer
For row = 1 To 10 'let's say there is 10 rows
</code></pre>

<p>...Doesn't need the comment anymore.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I would like to use VBA to assign the value of the cells in the empty column based on the value of the adjacent string in the other column.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that's [mis|ab]using VBA: Excel itself is very good at dealing with assigning cell values based on other cells' values.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>regexAdmin.Pattern = "Admin" 
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that's [mis|ab]using regex: if your pattern is just a plain word, you're most probably trying to kill a mosquito with a bazooka. Wrong tool for the job here.</p>

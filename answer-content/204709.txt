  <p>Is there a more concise way to accomplish this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Certainly.</p>

<p>For a start, the special cases are unnecessary. (They make me think that the code has been refactored from a recursive version).</p>

<p>Secondly, the expensive <code>del temp[i:i+3]</code> could be replaced with <code>i += 3</code>, and since the processing is no longer destructive <code>temp</code> is unnecessary. This simplifies the code to</p>

<pre><code>def beautifulBinaryString(b):
    count, i = 0, 0
    while (i+3 &lt;= len(b)):
        if b[i:i+3] == "010":
            count, i = count+1, i+3
        else: i += 1
    return count
</code></pre>

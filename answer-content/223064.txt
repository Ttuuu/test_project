<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>System.out.println(sex + " using bathroom. Current employees in bathroom = " + size);
</code></pre>

<p>This line is not protected by <code>lock</code>, so it is possible that <code>size</code> can change before the output is generated.</p>

<p>For example, if two <code>'M'</code> arrive simultaneously, you could get as output:</p>

<pre><code>M using bathroom.  Current employees in bathroom = 2
M using bathroom.  Current employees in bathroom = 2
</code></pre>

<p>which omits outputting <code>... = 1</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p><code>inUseBy</code> is left as the last occupant, even when <code>size</code> decreases to 0.  In the constructor, it is initialized to <code>""</code>, implying that the empty string might also indicate the bathroom is available to any gender.  When you decrease size to zero, you should clear <code>inUseBy</code>.</p>

<p>Not taking the comma and the ellipses into account when calculating the resulting string length and instead setting the max length to 250 is an ugly hack. The code is also a bit buggy, because if the first error message happens to be 250 characters long, you only get ellipses in the result even though there would have been room for the error message, a comma and ellipses.</p>

<p>You should create a method for calculating the result length if a string was appended.</p>

<pre><code>private int calculateResultingLength(String str) {
    int result = stringBuilder.length();
    if (result &gt; 0) {
        result += 1; // Account for a comma.
    }
    if (errorsDropped) {
        result += ELLIPSES.length();
    }
    result += str.length();

    return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The second <code>isFull</code> check in <code>checkAndAppend</code> is redundant because you already do that check in the append method and checkAndAppend is private. The isFull is now also misleading, because it tells that an error was dropped. The next error might be shorter and fit into the string. I rename it to <code>errorsDropped</code>.</p>

<pre><code>public void append(String str) {
    if (calculateResultingLength(str) &gt;= MAX_CAP) {
        errorsDropped = true;
    } else {
        performAppend(str);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>isFirst</code> field is redundant. You know the append is the first one if the stringBuilder is empty:</p>

<pre><code>private void performAppend(String str) {
    if (stringBuilder.length() &gt; 0) {
        stringBuilder.append(",");
    }
    stringBuilder.append(str);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The performAppend method became a bit pointless now. You could just write:</p>

<pre><code>public void append(String str) {
    if (calculateResultingLength(str) &gt;= MAX_CAP) {
        errorsDropped = true;
        return;
    }

    if (stringBuilder.length() &gt; 0) {
        stringBuilder.append(",");
    }
    stringBuilder.append(str);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The MAX_CAP and ELLIPSES are named as if they were constants but they are variables. They should be static and final. Also, no need to abbreviate here.</p>

<pre><code>private static final int MAX_CAPACITY = 255;
private static final String ELLIPSES = "...";
</code></pre>

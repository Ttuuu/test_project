<p>I have two suggestions:</p>

<ol>
<li>I like tests to be very easily human-readable. Instead of separate arrays of input and output, which are not aligned with each other, find a way to put the input and the expected output on one line.</li>
</ol>

<p>The easiest way in this case would be to add a method</p>

<pre><code>private void testRomanToArabic(String input, int expectedOutput) {
    assertEquals(RomanNumbers.romanToArabic(input), expectedOutput);
}
</code></pre>

<p>and then use this method repeatedly like</p>

<pre><code>testRomanToArabic("XXXIII", 33);
</code></pre>

<p>etc. There are other ways to put input and expected output next to each other (e.g. create an object holding both), but this is the simplest.</p>

<ol start="2">
<li>Don't catch the AssertionError and print the result yourself. The test should be run by a test runner which will handle this part for you. I always do this from the Eclipse IDE by selecting "Run As JUnit Test", but there is for sure a way to do the same thing from the command line.</li>
</ol>

<p>By catching the AssertionError, you hide the error from external tools, meaning you have to read the output yourself. If the AssertionError is thrown, your testing framework is aware of the error, which becomes very important when you have hundreds of tests: it can highlight for you the handful that are failing.</p>

<p>@mtj already provided a great answer; but I will add mine as I couldn't resist this. </p>

<h2>Needless comments</h2>

<p>The whole point of comments in code (IMHO) is to add information that is not there yet. Most often to describe WHY something is done in a way. The HOW, we can read from code if it is clean enough :).</p>

<p>Take a look a this comment for example. What does it add?</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * The lottery configuration.
 */
private final LotteryConfiguration lotteryConfiguration;
</code></pre>

<p>Nothing valuable. It just repeats the code. It also makes refactoring harder, because you need to keep the comments in sync with the code.</p>

<h2>Missing comments</h2>

<p>This piece of code goes without comments, but would be an excellent candidate for clarification; WHY is the array initialized with <code>1</code> to <code>numbers.length</code> ? Can't tell from this code. (I can tell from the shuffle later on)</p>

<pre><code>   for (int i = 0; i &lt; this.numbers.length; i++) {
        this.numbers[i] = i + 1;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This is a hard question to answer because this problem is so simple it simply does not <em>need</em> an object-oriented solution. You'd be much better just writing two methods named <code>convertCToF</code> and <code>convertFToC</code> which will throw an <code>Exception</code> at absolute zero (if you desire).</p>

<p>Critique:</p>

<ul>
<li>You should make your <code>Constructor(...)</code> methods <code>public</code>, as per convention</li>
<li>There is no need for empty constructors.</li>
<li>If you are going the object-oriented route in Java, it's best practice to use encapsulation and declare member fields to be <code>private</code> and write <code>get</code> and <code>set</code> methods for said fields. </li>
<li>You could instead declare an <code>interface</code> with a method called <code>convert</code> and attach them to your classes, that way it will be mandatory to implement a <code>convert</code> method rather than having to use <code>@Override</code></li>
</ul>

<p>But overall you really need to reconsider if you actually <em>need</em> to use OOP for this. See this video covering the overuse of <code>class</code> in Python. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9pEzgHorH0" rel="noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9pEzgHorH0</a></p>

<p>Lots of little pieces of advice:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Tab the lines of code inside of your loops and functions (etc) for improved readability.</p></li>
<li><p>Only declare the <code>$key</code> variable in your <code>foreach()</code> loop if you intend to use it.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid performing iterated trips to the database.  Furthermore, always endeavor to minimize total trips to the database unless you have a data volume issue to contend with.</p></li>
<li><p>Use meaningful variable names.  <code>$checkArr</code> does not speak clearly of the data that it holds.</p></li>
<li><p>Quote your associative array keys.</p></li>
<li><p>You aren't filtering out any dates between the two selected users, so you can avoid calling date-fetching queries entirely.</p></li>
<li><p>After writing your WHERE condition to isolate the messages between the pair of users, sort the rows by descending datetime.</p></li>
<li><p>Use all uppercase for MySQL reserved words for clarity / readability.</p></li>
<li><p>Before <code>return $data</code>, you can run a simple loop to group the message data by date.  Use the date value as the first level keys and just push the row data as subarrays.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Suggested single query: (well... really I recommend a prepared statement)</p>

<pre><code>$query =
"SELECT DATE(date_added) AS `date`, sender_id, receiver_id, `msg
FROM tb_chats
WHERE
  (sender_id = " . (int)$checkArr['sender_id'] . " AND receiver_id = " . (int)$checkArr['receiver_id'] . ")
  OR
  (sender_id = " . (int)$checkArr['receiver_id'] . " AND receiver_id = " . (int)$checkArr['sender_id'] . ")
ORDER BY date_added DESC";
</code></pre>

<p>Grouping with php:</p>

<pre><code>foreach ($data as $row) {
    $grouped[array_shift($row)][] = $row;
}
// this step can be performed in a number of different ways according to style preference / micro-optimization
return $grouped;
</code></pre>

<p>I don't know code igniter, so if the grouping can be done with an available function, I don't know it.</p>

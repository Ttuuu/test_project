<p>You have a couple of good answers.  Since you are an experienced developer who is new to C#, I will address some other things.</p>

<p><strong>Things you do quite well</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Braces and indentation</li>
<li>Naming (most of the time)</li>
</ul>

<p>For the last item, most of your naming is good.  As @iSR5 mentions, <code>TimeDateCreated</code> could have a better name.  I have been programming since the 1980's, and I went through those years of the variable name including the data type and scope.  With .NET, this is no longer needed, but more so with .NET and C# usage, <strong><em>it is frowned upon</em></strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Spots for improvement</strong></p>

<p>I would like to see an access modifier on class <code>Post</code>.  Either <code>public</code> or <code>internal</code>.  </p>

<p>As @potato says, the creation date should be read-only.  Likewise, you may want to add a <code>ModifiedDate</code>.  This would be updated anytime the title and description are altered.  Thinking ahead, there likely would be a <code>Content</code> to the post, and changing it would also affect <code>ModifiedDate</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Voting By User (Version 2?)</strong></p>

<p>Beyond that, your code looks decent.  My remaining issue is the class design.  A <code>Post</code> should have a 1-to-many relationship with users (voters).  Just like here, you have created a post.  I can vote on it, potato can vote on it, iSR5 votes, etc.  I would think tracking the votes in your class should be redesigned to account for this. </p>

<p>Great job, looks really good! A few minor thoughts, on top of the existing answers:</p>

<pre><code>class LinkedList(object):
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>You don't need to explicitly inherit from <code>object</code> if you're writing python3 code that doesn't require to be python2 compatible. This happens implicitly in python3. You've already done this for <code>Node</code>. Check out new style vs. old style classes if you want to learn more about this.</p>

<pre><code>class LinkedList:
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>Moreover, you could define a function to add multiple values, such as:</p>

<pre><code>def extend(self, vals):
    for val in vals:
        self.append(val)
</code></pre>

<p>You can also use that in your <code>__init__</code> if initial values are provided.</p>

<p>Additionally, you could define an <code>__iter__</code> function that implements a generator. This could help you with tasks for which you don't want to use <code>to_list()</code> and allocate the memory for a list.</p>

<pre><code>def __iter__(self):
    curr = self.head
    while curr:
        yield curr
        curr = curr.next
</code></pre>

<p>Lastly, I don't like using <code>next</code> as a variable, because it's already built-in, but that's not going to cause any trouble here.</p>

<p>Global Event Bus is a solution but since you have to listen emits in components's mounted or created lifecycle hook, it's getting duplicated in each instance.</p>

<p>I had same 'issue' and resolved it by mounting my popup component dynamically and setting it into prototype of my Vue instance. </p>

<p>Example;</p>

<pre><code>import Vue from 'vue';
import Popup from '@/components/Popup.vue';

Vue.prototoype.$popup = new Vue(Popup).$mount();
</code></pre>

<p>Imagine you have <code>show</code> method in your <code>Popup</code> component. Now with this injection you can use it in any component as;</p>

<pre><code>this.$popup.show();
</code></pre>
    </div>

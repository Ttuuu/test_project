<li><p>First off, style. Your code is... not very well styled. You have <em>many</em> <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="noreferrer">PEP8</a> violations. Here's a list of those violations.</p>

<ol>
<li>You have no space between operators/variable declarations. You should have one space between operators, like this: <code>a + b</code>, <code>a == b</code>, or <code>var = 10</code>.</li>
<li>Secondly, your variable names need to be more descriptive. Names like <code>cont</code>, <code>arx</code>, or <code>l</code> are not good. Names should be not too short, not too long, and as descriptive as possible.</li>
<li>You need two blank lines between functions.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>I'm not quite sure on this, but I think you issue with memory stems from the fact that you're doing <em>many</em> intensive calculations. Python is not Mathematica or R, which means that it isn't built specifically to do calculations like this. You could use a mathematical library, like <a href="http://www.numpy.org/" rel="noreferrer">numpy</a>, as well. See if you can shorten or simplify some of your expressions.</p></li>
<li>You're also doing a ton of looping, which can hang the program, especially with all those calculations. See where loops can be shortened.</li>
<li>Finally, it seems like you're allocating quite a bit of items to lists. If you can remove lists after they're needed, this may speed up your execution time. </li>
</ol>

<p>You are right, but there are better ways to do that.
One way is using dotenv. Trending way for managing configurations.</p>

<p>from dotenv project:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Storing configuration in the environment is one of the tenets of a
  twelve-factor app. Anything that is likely to change between
  deployment environments – such as database credentials or credentials
  for 3rd party services – should be extracted from the code into
  environment variables.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what you are doing is right, the way you are doing may not be best.</p>

<p>Since you are doing require_once(), you may want to check if file exists else it would be fatal error.</p>

<p>The problems I see with keeping that path in Apache:</p>

<ol>
<li>You may need to modify apache config and restart / reload Apache for your new configurations</li>
<li>Not all developers in your team may have access to Apache config. If the config is in code itself, like .env, it would be easy for developers.</li>
<li>Debugging would be easy with .env</li>
<li>If you plan to unit test, mocking would be easy.</li>
</ol>

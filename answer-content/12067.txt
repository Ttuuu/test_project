<p>The general advice for years has been <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182137%28v=vs.80%29.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">"Do not catch general exception types"</a>. This has been debated in many places, including <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21938/is-it-really-that-bad-to-catch-a-general-exception">on StackÂ Overflow</a>. Basically, the advice only holds true if you don't rethrow the exception. Since you are, at least in one instance, it's not a big deal. The <code>TryCatchLog</code> is a little more dangerous, since you're not rethrowing, but merely logging. That opens the potential for the application to be in a bad state.</p>

<p>This is dangerous if <code>n</code> gets large, because the multiplication could overflow. After the overflow, too little memory has been allocated but code will continue without detecting the error.</p>

<p>This is especially dangerous if <code>n</code> comes from untrusted source, such as some file format or remote user. Then it gives attacker easy way to overwrite parts of memory with exploit code.</p>

<p>The easy safe solution is to use <code>calloc()</code> which will detect the overflow (at least on most common libc implementations). If you really need to use <code>malloc()</code> for some reason, you can <a href="https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/c/INT30-C.+Ensure+that+unsigned+integer+operations+do+not+wrap" rel="noreferrer">check for overflow separately</a>.</p>

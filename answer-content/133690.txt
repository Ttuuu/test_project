<p>My initial impression is that there seems to be quite a lot of shared responsibility, particularly between the static methods in <code>Program</code> and the rest of the code.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>private static bool GameLoop(Game game)
</code></pre>

<p>This really seems like it should belong in your <code>Game</code> class.  It's also odd that this function doesn't actually contain the loop, so you have to call it from within one:</p>

<pre><code>while (GameLoop(game)) ;
</code></pre>

<p>This seems counter intuitive.  Perhaps it should be <code>GetRound</code> or something and called by <code>GameLoop</code> where both of them sit in the <code>Game</code> class...</p>

<p><strong>Player Construction</strong></p>

<p><code>Game</code> contains an array of players, which it creates on construction, however it isn't responsible for populating the players.   This tightly couples the <code>Game</code> class to <code>CreatePlayers</code> in your <code>Program</code> class.  If <code>GetScoresTable</code> is called before the players are created the program will crash.</p>

<p>A better approach might be to have <code>CreatePlayers</code> actually create an array of players and then have the array passed into the constructor of <code>Game</code>, rather than the number of players.  That way, <code>Game</code> is in a completely constructed state and is ready for other methods on the class to be called.</p>

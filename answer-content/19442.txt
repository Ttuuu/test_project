<p>There is an approach: prefer composition instead of inheritance.</p>

<p>Inherit only and only when you need to "avoid copy-paste" or use the same behaviour(the same method) and extend them.</p>

<p>Student is a Person - ok.
Course have few Students - it is a composition(Student should be a field in class Course, and will be collection of students - List), not a inheritance.</p>

<p>Why you did " public class Person extends Test" is unclear for me, can not explain it at all.</p>

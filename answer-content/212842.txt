<p>In addition to other answers, I would like to focus on "Bag management"</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I would extract elementary bag operations like simple adding/removing/searching an item from high level methods like: <code>buyItem</code>, <code>sellItem</code>, <code>addItem</code> and <code>useItem</code>. Following OOD principles, I think that the best place for those elementary operations is <code>Bag</code> class itself.</p></li>
<li><p>After this simple refactoring, it would be easier to fix some bugs/corner cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>Consider buying a new item when player does not have any empty slot for it.</li>
<li>Consider an exploit by passing an item that player does not have in his inventory to <code>useItem</code>/<code>sellItem</code> methods</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>I would suggest writing some test cases for it (as you have test suite ready for use)</p></li>
</ol>

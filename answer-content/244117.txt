<p>Couple of pointers. You are mixing data notation and fluent mapping.</p>
<p>replace <code>NotMapped</code> attribute with <code>.Ignore</code> fluent mapping.</p>
<p>Also I think its cleaner to move each entity into its own mapping config class using <code>IEntityTypeConfiguration&lt;T&gt;</code></p>
<p>Dont mix DTO and entities like that. Best practice is to project your entities to DTOs.</p>

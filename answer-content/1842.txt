<p>There is a serious flaw in your handling of the empty list. A user would expect that these definitions are equivalent, but they ain't:</p>

<pre><code>Nlist n1 = new NList("x");
Nlist n2 = new NList("x", new NList());
</code></pre>

<p>I strongly recommend to have an explicit subclass for the empty list (possibly a singleton) and to prohibit null for _cdr.</p>
    </div>

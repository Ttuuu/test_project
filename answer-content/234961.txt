<p>The more "Pythonic" way (aka using Pythonic syntactic sugar to make the code more concise) of writing this:</p>

<pre><code>is_repeat = True
for n in neighbours:
    if coverage.get(n,0)&lt;2:
        is_repeat = False
        break
</code></pre>

<p>would be:</p>

<pre><code>is_repeat = all([coverage.get(n, 0) &gt;= 2 for n in neighbors])
</code></pre>

<p>but I'm not sure this will necessarily be any more efficient.</p>

<p>Is <code>is_repeat</code> true most of the time (forcing this iteration to go through all of the neighbors)?  If so, maybe the thing to focus on is optimizing earlier detection of that case in some other part of the script where it'll be easier to figure out.</p>

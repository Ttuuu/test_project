<p>If the file size is 0, it ignores that file (when it returns 0 from the size function and uses that to determine if the file is newer). I noticed this when testing it and I created an empty file and saw it was not mirrored. I would think the right behavior should be that it should copy the empty file.</p>

<p>Also, it does not mirror deletions, if something is deleted in the source folder, it will not be deleted in the 'synced' folder</p>

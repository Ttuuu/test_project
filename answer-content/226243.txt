<p>There are a couple of typo's in your code and filenames. I was going to list them all, but it's a long list.</p>

<p>Edsger W. Dijkstra, is spelled with IJ. Not JI. So every reference to dji or djikstra is a typo. Quite a consistent typo, but a user won't expect having to use <code>-dji</code> or <code>--djikstra</code> as arguments. So it needs to be replaced.</p>

<p>Except <code>djikstra_time</code> though, that simply needs to be renamed to something more obvious. <code>start_time</code> perhaps?</p>

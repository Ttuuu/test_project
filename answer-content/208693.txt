<p>This is pretty reasonable.  I'd have <code>awk</code> do a bit more of the work:</p>

<pre><code>ip=$( hostname -I | awk '{print $1}' | awk -F. '{OFS="."; print $1, $2, $3,"*"}'; );
</code></pre>

<p>I switched from <code>ORS</code> (output record separator) to <code>OFS</code> (output field separator) to use <code>print</code> in <code>awk</code> with commas.  The commas tell it that we have multiple fields which gets rid of two "extra" <code>print</code> statements.  This also let me move the literal <code>*</code> inside of <code>awk</code> which eliminates the shell <code>echo</code>.  So I feel this is more succinct without being harder to follow.</p>

<p>It might be nice to combine the <code>awk</code>s into one, but it is pretty clear what each one does and it isn't like you're processing reams of data here.</p>

<p>You shouldn't need to create a HeadNode, just use one of the ones given to you. Right now you relink every single item. But if one list has many sequential values, you could save time by just advancing to the tail.  Also, right now you are checking 2 conditions in every loop even though only 1 changes.</p>

<p>You could try something like this: (after setting cur to the minimum node):</p>

<pre><code>while True:
   while cur.next and cur.next.val &lt;= l2.val:
       cur = cur.next
   cur.next = l2
   if not cur.next:  break

   while cur.next and l2.val &lt;= l1.val:
       cur = cur.next
   cur.next = l1
   if not cur.next:  break
</code></pre>
    </div>

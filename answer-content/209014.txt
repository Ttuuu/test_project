<p>Your spelling of <code>length</code> is unconventional, and will cause errors.</p>

<p>Calculating the full result will generate a large number, slowing computation.  It's better to reduce the partial results as you compute the power, and keep the partial result mod <em>n</em> - you'll probably want to use <strong>binary exponentiation</strong> instead of the <code>**</code> operator so that you can apply the modulus to the intermediate results.</p>

<p>I don't see what <code>m = int(m)</code> and similar lines are intended to achieve - probably worth a comment there.</p>

<p>How is the final (partial) block handled?  That seems to be missing altogether.</p>

<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>For your specific case of two rolls of n-sided dice:</p>

<pre><code>def sumsFromTwoRolls(sides):
    return sorted(a + b for a in range(1, sides + 1) for b in range(1, sides + 1))
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>As <code>sides</code> or <code>number of rolls</code> gets big, you would want a more generic solution, and also probably an algorithm that sorts as you go, instead of looping through again afterwards with <code>sort()</code>.</p>

<p>Another little trick is that (depending on how much you're supposed to be implementing yourself), <code>reverseIt(arr)</code> is just <code>arr[::-1]</code> (slicing with a negative step starts from the end).</p>

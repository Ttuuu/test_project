<h1>Avoid <code>using namespace std;</code></h1>

<p>Bringing all names in from a namespace is problematic; <code>namespace std</code> particularly so. See <a href="//stackoverflow.com/q/1452721">Why is “using namespace std” considered bad practice?</a>.</p>

<h1>Variable names could be more informative</h1>

<p>What do <code>f</code>, <code>t</code> and <code>x</code> represent?  I can just about guess that <code>rev</code> is the reverse of something, but the others give me no clue.</p>

<h1>Choose data types wisely</h1>

<p>The linked problem statement says that the input may have up to one million digits.  None of the built-in integer types have such a range, so you may find it easier to represent the number using a string type.</p>

<h1>Use a more intelligent algorithm</h1>

<p>We don't need to perform a brute-force search.  Given the first half of the number, the second half can be constructed to make a palindrome.  All we have to do is to determine whether the middle digit (or digit pair, for even-length numbers) needs to be incremented in order for the result to be larger than the input string.</p>

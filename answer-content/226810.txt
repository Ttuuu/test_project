<p>This doesn't quite answer your questions, but still hopefully helpful.</p>

<p><code>var perRound = 1; perRound &lt; 5; perRound++</code> only executes four times; the fifth execution is coming from the last line of your program. It's customary to use <code>i</code> when simply doing something multiple times, and to start with <code>0</code> such as: <code>var i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++</code>. Then remove that extra <code>playRound</code> at the end so you still have five rounds.</p>

<p>I would rename <code>convertMoves</code> to <code>playerMove</code> to better describe what it does instead of how it does it.</p>

<p><code>playRound</code> isn't using its arguments. So you can change the first few lines to:</p>

<pre><code>    function playRound() {
        var computerSelection = computerPlay();
        var playerSelection = convertMoves();
</code></pre>

<p>You might play with changing <code>moves</code> to an array and see if you like it better as <code>moves = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors'];</code>. This will require several other changes to how you use it but I think it'll read easier in the end.</p>

<p>Just as a matter of style, put the <code>++</code> after the variable except for the rare times when you really need the other behavior.</p>

<p>Again, hope this helps.</p>

<p>Edit: I see now why you have the extra <code>playRound</code> at the end. But <code>result</code> is already global so you can simply end with <code>console.log(result)</code> instead of returning it from <code>playRound</code> each time.</p>

<p>You're right that you shouldn't make assumptions about the DOM when writing your state manager. Actually you should start by writing just your state manager, without worrying how that state should be reflected in the DOM. </p>

<p>When your state manager works, you can write a separate class that does the DOM manipulation - based on the state in your state manager class. This is actually called an MVC pattern. A Model class represents the State. A View class represents the DOM view, and a Controller class decides how the state should be represented in the View. </p>

<p>If you google for "managing state" and "MVC" you'll find a lot of resources, and libraries that already fix this problem for you :)</p>

<p>For starters, I suggest not mixing javascript and php too much, this will get confusing really quickly. Also, generally speaking, do not use CSS classes to find out in what state your app is. CSS is only used to represent state, not to keep track of it.</p>

<p>Neither is good, but surely we can all agree that the Java example is way uglier. The biggest problem, however, is that both examples hard code data into code.</p>

<p>Separate data, i.e. stream and subject IDs and their titles into a data class and in that class implement code that accesses the data structure without detailed knowledge about the actual data. Responsibility of setting up the data structure to resemble your stream and subject numbering is left to a separate component (load it from file or set up in static code).</p>

<p>Whether the data class is a recursive structure or just a wrapper for a <code>HashMap</code> depends on the complexity of your data.</p>

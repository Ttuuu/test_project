<p>Given a state machine <em>p</em> which has initial state <em>s</em> and final state <em>f</em>, then it can only accept 0, 5, 10, 20 as inputs. This can be represented graphically as such:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sn5qU.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sn5qU.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>Therefore, the machine must continue to run until the sum of the coins entered exceeds or equals 25. Therefore, the Python code can be written to be more faithful to the state machine as:</p>

<pre><code>states = {
  "s": {0: "s", 5: "q1", 10: "q2", 20: "q4"},
  "q1": {0: "q1", 5: "q2", 10: "q3", 20: "f"},
  "q2": {0: "q2", 5: "q3", 10: "q4", 20: "f"},
  "q3": {0: "q3", 5: "q4", 10: "f", 20: "f"},
  "q4": {0: "q4", 5: "f", 10: "f", 20: "f"},
  "f": {0: "f"}
}

current_state = "s"

prompt = """\tThe parking machine.

Information:
1. The machine takes 5, 10, 20 coins.
2. The machine doesn't give a change.
3. The parking costs 25 pence.
"""
prompt = '#' * 80 + prompt + '#' * 80 + '\n'
print(prompt)

while (current_state != "f"):
  try:
      current_state = states[current_state][int(input("Insert coin: "))]
  except (ValueError, KeyError):
      print("Error: only 5, 10, 20 pence coins are allowed\n")

print("""\nTake your ticket:

Date: 1 November 2019
Start time: \t20:21
End time: \t22:21\n
""")
</code></pre>

<p>This removes all issues with recursion and stack overflows as there is no history (it is impossible to determine if state <em>q1</em> was reached by accepting state 0 or 5, or any combination of those.</p>

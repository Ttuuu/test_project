<p>I think you need to decide weather to repeat only on the first level of the list, or if you want to do a tree walk for lists inside lists. As is, this code produces a weird combination of both in an exponential explosion of the list, The following sample returns over 2 million leaf elements for an input of length 26 and a repeat of 10. </p>

<pre><code>(leaf-count (super-duper '(a (b (c (d (e f g (h i) j k) l m n o) p q ) r (s t (u v) w ) x y) z) 10)) 
-&gt;&gt; 2576420

(define (leaf-count Tree)
  (cond ((null? Tree) 0)
        ((not (pair? Tree)) 1)
        (else (+ (leaf-count (car Tree))
                 (leaf-count (cdr Tree))))))
</code></pre>

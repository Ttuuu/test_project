<p><strong>I just started programming in Python (well in general) a week ago</strong></p>

<p>This is the analogy I used to make sense of the problem. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You have a word like Monday. Each character in the word has a value:
   'M' = 1, 'o' = 2, n = '3', d = '4', a = '5', y = '6'. If you added the value of each character in the word 'Monday' it would be:
  1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21
  So the 'numerical value' of Monday would be 21</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now you have a limit like 9</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The question is asking you to create a program that takes a list of numbers like [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
  And find out how many of these numbers (starting from the left because prefix means the beginning of word or in this case the list â€“ which starts from the left i.e. 1) can be added together before their sum is greater than the limit.
  The answer would be the sum of the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 which is 10.
  Your prefix is the list [1, 2, 3, 4]</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>num = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

limit = 9

def prefixLimit(limit, num):
    sumOfPrefix = 0
    prefix = [] 
    for i in num:
        if sumOfPrefix &lt; limit:
            sumOfPrefix = sumOfPrefix + i
            prefix.append(i)
            if sumOfPrefix &gt; limit:
                return prefix

print(prefixLimit(limit, num))
</code></pre>

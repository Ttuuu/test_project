<p>I think that list generator won't improve your performance in this case because it will require you to create another list (since <code>range</code> is not a good fit for this). You could create a generator that <code>yield</code>s powers but it basically will be moving one piece of code to another function</p>

<p>So I don't think you can optimize this. Unless you allocate memory for a list before filling it but it won't improve readability.</p>

<p>IMHO</p>

<li><p>It is unlikely that <code>mid * mid</code> would ever be equal to <code>x</code>, so the opportunistic <code>mid * mid != x</code> consumes more cycles than it may save. I recommend to drop it entirely.</p></li>
<li><p>The convergence rate is not the best. Your algorithm adds (approximately) one bit of precision per iteration. Compare it to a classic Newton-Raphson, which <em>doubles</em> the amount of correct bits per iteration.</p></li>
<li><p>As mentioned in the comment, <em>without using any built-in function</em> part of assignment rules out using <code>Math.abs</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>You may want to check the input for correctness: both <code>x</code> and <code>precision</code> must be positive.</p></li>

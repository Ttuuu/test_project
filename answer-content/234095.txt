<p>The use of <code>L.index(smallest_num)</code> makes neither of these implementations valid. Using the input list <code>[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]</code> as an example, both of your implementations give <code>[1, 1, 0, 0, 1]</code> as their result, and this is clearly not sorted correctly.</p>

<p>The reason your algorithm doesn't work on this input is that it contains duplicate elements, so the <code>.index</code> method doesn't always return the index you want it to; as the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#common-sequence-operations" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a> says, the <code>.index</code> method returns the index of the <em>first occurrence</em> of the given value. That will not always be the index of the occurrence you want to find; sometimes, that index is in the "already-sorted" part of the list, so you end up swapping things back there where they don't belong.</p>

<p>A correct implementation of selection sort should search for the index of the minimum element in just the unsorted part of the list.</p>

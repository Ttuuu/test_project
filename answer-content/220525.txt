<p>While <code>-Filter</code> is usually the fastest way as it handled by the provider,<br>
I'm not sure this is true compared to one <code>-Include</code> with an array which only recurses once instead of 8 times.</p>

<pre><code>$Include = '*.clip*','*.ptf','*.wfm','*.repeaks','*.DS_STORE','._.*','Thumbs*.db','*.ini'

Get-ChildItem  -Recurse -Name -Include $Include | Remove-Item
</code></pre>

<p>As for the duplicates, your approach will only eliminate dupes in the same folder.<br>
An alternative would be grouping the output with a calculated property which strips off the date in parentheses. And then iterating the groups and sorting by whatever means, keeping only the first/last - removing the others.</p>

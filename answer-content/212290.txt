<h2>Group your imports</h2>

<p>You should put all of your imports at the top of the file instead of sprinkling them throughout the code. This is both a best practice and a recommendation from <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP8</a></p>

<h2>Don't use wildcard imports</h2>

<p>You import Tkinter with <code>from tkinter import *</code>, but the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP8</a> guidelines (and best practices) say you should not. For me, the best way to import Tkinter is with <code>import tkinter as tk</code> because it avoids polluting the global namespace and gives you a short prefix for using Tkinter classes and objects.  The prefix helps to make your code a bit more self-documenting.</p>

<h2>Use more functions and classes</h2>

<p>Most of your code exists in the global namespace. While that's fine for short programs, it becomes difficult to manage as the program grows. Its good to get in the habit of always using functions or classes for nearly all of your code.</p>

<p>For example, I recommend putting all of the GUI code into a class. That will make the code a bit easier to read, and gives you the flexibility of moving the code to a separate file.</p>

<h2>clearBox should restore the state of the text widget</h2>

<p>Your <code>clearBox</code> function resets the state of the text widget to be editable so that it can clear the contents, but it doesn't set it back. That means that after clicking the clear button, the user could be able to type anything they want in that window. It's somewhat harmless, but is a bit sloppy.</p>

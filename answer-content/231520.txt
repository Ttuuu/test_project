<p>Your second selector doesn't work with the data provided <code>input:tel#8888</code> is not the <code>id=</code> of the input.  </p>

<p>IDs <em>should</em> start with a letter (for compatibility), so if you changed your input to <code>&lt;input id="inp8888"&gt;</code> then you could use <code>input:tel#inp8888</code> in which case, you can use <code>$("#inp8888")</code> as long as your IDs are unique (which they should be).</p>

<p>Selecting by ID is the fastest selection method. </p>

  <p>jQuery uses document.getElementById(), which is faster</p>

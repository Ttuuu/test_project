<p>A couple of general notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>I’m not sure why you used a macro for <code>peek_char!</code>. I’m relatively certain this could have been a standard function. </li>
<li>Take some time to learn about slices. </li>
<li>You have a single, several hundred line function there. It’s hard to read and follow. Extract lots of well named functions to improve readability. </li>
<li>If you <code>panic</code> inside your function, there’s not really any way for the person calling your function to handle it. This should return a <code>Result&lt;Token, ParseError&gt;</code>. </li>
</ul>
    </div>

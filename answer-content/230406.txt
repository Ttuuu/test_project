<p>The code is nice and short, and it is easy to read.</p>

<p>I'm surprised that it works at all. Sending the <code>out=$(â€¦)</code> command to the background sounds as if the code might continue before curl had the chance to fill the output. Do you get the same results without the <code>&amp;</code>? I'd expect that more names are reported as available then.</p>

<p>As long as the <code>&amp;</code> is in the program, I would verify the results manually.</p>

<p>I also don't see the point of running the requests in parallel. It's only 10 * 26 requests, which are answered anyway within 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Update: The <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_09_03_02" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Shell Command Language specification</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a command is terminated by the control operator  ( '&amp;' ), the shell shall execute the command asynchronously in a subshell.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that the variable assignment cannot affect the <code>out</code> variable at all. This in turn means that the output you posted does not correspond to the code you posted. Please check again.</p>

<p>If you can reproduce the behavior, please write down all details that might influence it. I tried to reproduce it, and I got exactly the result I expect after reading the specification: all names are not available.</p>

<h3>Class design</h3>
<p>Apart from the parsing logic I find the <code>PhoneNumber</code> class should not have its three <code>PartX</code> properties but a single property <code>Value</code> that stores all digits.</p>
<p>How many parts a phone number has it's purely a visual representation and should be implemented either by the UI or alternatively by <code>ToString(format)</code>.</p>
<h3>Parsing</h3>
<p>I wouldn't say that restricting phone numbers to exact three equally long parts is a good idea as there is no standard format for them. I sugesst to just match the digits and other allowed separators and capture only digts:</p>
<pre><code>var digits =
    Regex
        .Matches("123-456-789", @"(?:(\d)|[-])")
        .Cast&lt;Match&gt;()
        .Where(m =&gt; m.Groups[1].Success)
        .Select(m =&gt; m.Value);
</code></pre>
    </div>

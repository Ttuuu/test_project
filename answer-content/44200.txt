<p>I think you can improve the <em>'Inverse rotor pass'</em> a lot by hard-code the inverted rotors instead of searching the inverse function every time.</p>

<p>Your <code>a</code> is never below <code>-26</code> so you could try to replace  </p>

<pre><code>long mod26(long a)
{
  return (a%26+26)%26;
}
</code></pre>

<p>by</p>

<pre><code>long mod26(long a)
{
  return (a+26)%26;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But only profiling will tell you if / how much speed improvement that brings. Also you should always profile before trying to optimize. See were the bottleneck is.</p>

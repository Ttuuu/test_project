<blockquote>
  <p>I want to give user ability to search anything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It looks like you've achieved that, however, I'd use <code>$_POST</code> to reduce the likelihood that your application will be taken offline by users opening multiple tabs or search engine spiders hitting URLs.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Will it be 100% safe and work as it should do for searching pieces of text in database?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Looks good for SQL injection.</p>

<p>As to whether it "should do" - have you considered generating the query dynamically to allow for tokenized search on inputs like "foo bar"? (i.e. <code>ColB LIKE :token1 OR ColB LIKE :token2</code>)</p>

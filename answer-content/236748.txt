<p>The code as is suffers from a few problems, the most obvious at first glance ones being:</p>

<h3>Lack of Vertical Spacing</h3>

<p>All the code is compressed into very little vertical space. It's not easy to mentally follow along with an infodump. Instead a maintainer would have it easier if they could <strong>see</strong> logical units in the code.</p>

<p>This can be as easy as adding a single empty line before each section starting with `nFilasActualÂ´.</p>

<h3>Lack of Abstraction</h3>

<p>This code is indented four levels deep. After the second level of indentation, you <strong>should</strong> consider extracting the code into a method, just to maintain a cohesive level off semantic abstraction.</p>

<p>Intermingling "high-level" method calls and "low-level" iterations is very much less than ideal. Instead you want code that's in the same procedure to have a roughly equal level of abstraction. This reduces the strain on the reader, because reading requires less context-switching.</p>

<hr>

<p>Here are a few simplifications I'd make:</p>

<h3>Extract Simple Helper Procedures</h3>

<p>Since you repeat the following code twice, it's a good candidate for a separate procedure:</p>

<pre class="lang-vb prettyprint-override"><code>Sub SilentDeleteVisibleRows(filteredRange As Range)
    Application.DisplayAlerts = False
    filteredRange.Offset(1, 0).Resize(filteredRange.Rows.Count - 1) _
      .SpecialCells(xlCellTypeVisible).Rows.Delete
    ' This assumes DisplayAlerts was True before calling this method.
    ' Alternatively the state could be stored into a variable.
    Application.DisplayAlerts = True
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>Searching the number of lines is also something you do thrice:</p>

<pre class="lang-vb prettyprint-override"><code>Function NumberOfLines(sheet As Worksheet) As Long
    NumberOfLines = sheet.Cells(Rows.Count, 4).End(xlUp).Row
End Function
</code></pre>

<p>You might also want to extract the whole <code>With</code> block into some procedure with a good name to help the readability of the code overall (and reduce the level of indentation, freeing horizontal space).</p>

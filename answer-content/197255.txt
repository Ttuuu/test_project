<p>I think, presentation matters. My solution shows each parts separately in a human readable manner. The steps show how to break the problem before we begin to solve it</p>

<p><strong>Idea</strong> : Find all cities that have the smallest length.</p>

<p><strong>STEPS:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Find the minimum length of city .</li>
<li>Get all cities that have the MIN Length.</li>
<li>Sort by CITY .</li>
<li>Output the first result only.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Repeat same for MAX</strong> </p>

<pre><code>select CITY, length(CITY) from STATION where length(CITY) = (
    select MIN(length(CITY)) from STATION 
    ) order by CITY limit 1;

select CITY, length(CITY) from STATION where length(CITY) = (
    select MAX(length(CITY)) from STATION 
    ) order by CITY limit 1;
</code></pre>

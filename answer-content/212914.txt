<p>Here is a new logic I came up with 
For each letter, you need to know:</p>

<p>the total length of words consisting entirely of that letter;
the words with the longest and second-longest prefix of that letter; and
the words with the longest and second-longest suffix of that letter
Since each word goes in at most 2 of these groups, determined by the letters it starts and ends with, you can figure this all out in O(N) time
Will post the working snippet shortly</p>

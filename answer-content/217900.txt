<p>I see in <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/posts/217877/revisions#rev-arrow-9b4bd84e-513d-4972-8f21-7e20e9aa1676">revision 3</a> that the <code>else</code> keyword and block was replaced by the single line that was in the block. That is a good simplification. Some developers aim to avoid the <code>else</code> keyword with techniques like returning early (like this code) and other similar techniques.</p>

<p>The function declaration uses the <code>var</code> keyword. Unless the scope needs to be broader, <code>const</code> could have been used unless it needs to be re-assigned. </p>

<p>The suggestion in <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/217895/120114">vnp's answer</a> to check each element with the following two is a good one to reduce the space complexity. Another technique to do so would be to utilize <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Array.prototype.indedOf()</code></a> passing the current index + 1 as the second argument (i.e. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf#Parameters" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>fromIndex</code></a>). If that returns a value greater than -1 (or even the current index) then you would know the value is repeated. However this may be sub-optimal because it would require an extra function call.</p>

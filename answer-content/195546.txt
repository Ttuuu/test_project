<p>I did not read it all, here is just my comments on what I noticed first:</p>

<ul>
<li>There are no transactions, in the account. That is the transactions are not stored. This will stop the code from being re-entrent, prevent logging/auditing/monthly statements etc. You were told that the account stores transactions, <strong>not a reduction (of value)</strong>.</li>
<li>Never use floating point for money. Well done for using Decimal over float, but still not good enough. You should use a very big int, and work in pence/cents.</li>
</ul>
    </div>

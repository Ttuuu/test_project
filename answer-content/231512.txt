<p>R supports Perl-compatible regular expressions, and these support <code>\b</code>, which matches at word boundaries. You can use this to avoid matching <code>abstraction</code>:</p>

<pre><code>grep(paste0("^", word, "\\b"), haystack, perl = TRUE)
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of the string literals <code>"TRUE"</code> and <code>"FALSE"</code>, you should use the logical literals for the <code>reset</code> variable, just remove the quotes.</p>

<p>The spacing in your code is inconsistent. Have a look at <a href="https://style.tidyverse.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://style.tidyverse.org/</a> and either apply these rules manually to your code, or use an automatic formatter. RStudio certainly has one, and since a few days IntelliJ has an R plugin with a good formatter.</p>

<p>Instead of printing the result at the end of the function, you should rather just return it by leaving out the <code>print</code> and the parentheses. This makes it easier to write unit tests for it. If you haven't done so already, have a look at the <code>testthat</code> package.</p>

<p>The <code>if</code> branches for <code>i == 1</code> and for <code>reset == TRUE</code> are the same. You should merge them by making the condition <code>i == 1 || reset</code> (after you removed the quotes, as I suggested above).</p>

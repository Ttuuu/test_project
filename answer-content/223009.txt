<p>Since the code is about implementing mathematical formulas I would make an exception and completely ignore the usual naming conventions. Instead, I would use the exact symbols as  that document.</p>

<p>This would mean a little bit copy/paste because it's difficult to write symbols like [<code>ϕ</code>, <code>λ</code>, <code>θ</code>] but the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8837738/is-it-wrong-to-use-special-characters-in-c-sharp-source-code-such-as-%C3%B1">compiler can work with unicode</a>.</p>

<p>I find that code like this:</p>

<pre><code>var rad = 0.01745329252;

var ellipsoide = (a: 6378137, f: 1 / 298.257222101);
var ϕ1 = 49.8333333 * rad;
var ϕ2 = 51.1666667 * rad;
var ϕ0 = 50.797815 * rad;
var λ0 = 4.359215833 * rad;
var x0 = 649328;
var y0 = 665262;
</code></pre>

<p>is the most easy one to understand because you can compare it with the book almost without any <em>translation</em>.</p>

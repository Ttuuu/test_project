<p>As was pointed out, this question is off-topic here because this channel is for reviewing and improving code that works as designed. That said, an easy recursive solution using a normal outer function with a recursive inner function could look as follows:</p>

<pre><code>def largestDigit(n):
    def inner(d, n):
        if n == 0:
            return d
        else:
            return inner(max(d, n % 10), n // 10)
    return inner(0, abs(n))
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> To keep with the topic of improving working code, here is a shorter version using an <code>if</code> expression instead of an <code>if</code> statement:</p>

<pre><code>def largestDigit(n):
    def inner(d, n):
        return d if n == 0 else inner(max(d, n % 10), n // 10)
    return inner(0, abs(n))
</code></pre>
    </div>

<p>The test in the OP and Ron's test are both valid tests, but it's important to realize that they may not fail even if there are legitimate concurrency problems.</p>

<p>The test in the OP is unlikely to ever interleave the calls to add(). Even if the test ran thousands of times, t1 would usually always finish before t2 started.</p>

<p>Ron's test ensures that the calls to add() do interleave by using a CyclicBarrier. However, using the CyclicBarrier ensures that the state maintained by the two threads gets flushed to main memory, potentially hiding concurrency problems in both add() <em>and</em> dump().</p>

<p>Both tests are decent, and you might as well run them both. For true peace of mind though, why not post the code for the logger on this site?</p>

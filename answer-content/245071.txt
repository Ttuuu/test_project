<p>When I think back to my student days, the most crucial point for me to understand code was always the entry point. In my experience, it takes a lot of experience to understand a code concept as a whole. The untrained is used to step by step thinking and evaluation through step by step progression. I would not have understood that code because it describes the game and does not PLAY the game. I understood, that the code is not meant to play. But a clearly marked <code>start()</code> function initializing the board and doing some sample moves so the student can see and visualize how the code come together and what it can actually do, would help a lot. At least it would have helped me.</p>

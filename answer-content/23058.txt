<p>Your code is quite simple and works, there is not much to review.</p>

<p>Few points:</p>

<ol>
<li>You shouldn't use variable names like <code>oDog</code>. If the <code>o</code> is meant to indicate that it's an object, then that information already contained in the type of the variable, so the prefix is useless. If it indicates something else, then it's very confusing.</li>
<li>Your code is not a very good example, because it would work exactly the same even without the interface.</li>
</ol>

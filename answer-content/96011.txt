<ul>
<li>Regarding the constraints, it seems that you want to make everything <code>nullable</code> and non-nullable fields are the exceptions. There are settings for changing the default values. That can clean up your constraints.</li>
<li>Methods with five parameters. I have seen that become a mess. I would suggest to have a separate class to represent that data.</li>
<li>Services are <code>Transactional</code> by default so the annotation is redundant.</li>
<li>What would happen if a validation error occurs? Unless the database constraints fail you won't get an exception because by default failOnerror is false. I understand that in the particular case you have don't need to worry but it would be better to check whether there were any errors. All domain's have an <code>Errors</code> object. You can use that.</li>
<li>Using exceptions as part of your application flow - They hit performance and should be used for exceptional conditions. For validations failure there can be other ways. One way that I can suggest is to have a generic class <code>Domain&lt;T&gt;</code> that contains your domain and an Errors object. From every creation/updation you can return this generic class. The benefit would be internationalization support and not hard-coding everything in your service classes.</li>
<li>Generating the encoded password should be done in another service</li>
<li>Instead of catching exceptions everywhere you should use <code>Declarative Controller Exception Handling</code>. Read the docs for this section.</li>

<p>Generally, if you can, use libraries for cryptographic problems.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, you want to implement some sort of cryptography in your software or hardware project. Great. If you fuck this up people aren't going to be just mad like they might be with other bugs. They might be in prison or they might have been assassinated.</p>

<p>Other than that, you are hashing passwords with user-specific salts, which seems good. Only question left is whether your hashing algorithms are good enough.</p>

<p>As an aside: I would reconsider putting the crypto code in the user class. It really isn't a user problem, but that is an aside.</p>

<p>In addition to what is pointed out in the other answers, a few things:</p>

<p>First, <code>Vector</code> is a class in <code>java.util</code> so at the very least you shouldn't <code>import java.util.*</code> because there is a potential name conflict. It's better to import only the specific classes you need anyway.</p>

<p>Second, as pointed out in another answer, this class is only for 2D vectors so it should have a name that reflects that. This would also alleviate the potential conflict with <code>java.util.Vector</code>.</p>

<p>Continuing on the theme that the name of your class should reflect what it actually is, right now, what you've implemented is not a mathematical vector, so the name is misleading. The reason is that vectors are not numbers. The mathematical operations that work on numbers don't necessarily work on vectors; you can't divide one vector by another, for instance, and multiplication doesn't work by multiplying the components.</p>

<p>If you really want a class that represents a mathematical vector, you should give it methods for operations that one can actually perform on a vector. That would be some subset of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>vector addition</li>
<li>vector subtraction, which you could define as addition of the inverse</li>
<li>inversion, \$(x,y)\$ to \$(-x,-y)\$</li>
<li>scalar multiplication, \$a(x,y)\$ to \$(a x,a y)\$</li>
</ul>

<p>and a few more operations that are not technically part of the mathematical definition of "vector", but may be useful for the applications you have in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>dot product a.k.a. scalar product, \$x_1 y_1+x_2 y_2\$</li>
<li>norm a.k.a. magnitude a.k.a. length, which is the square root of the dot product of a vector with itself (you can use <code>Math.hypot</code>)</li>
<li>distance between two vectors, which is just the norm/magnitude/length of the difference between the vectors (again, you can use <code>Math.hypot</code>)</li>
<li>unit vector a.k.a. direction, \$\bigl(\frac{x}{\text{norm}},\frac{y}{\text{norm}}\bigr)\$</li>
<li>projection on to another vector, which is the dot product of this vector with the other vector's unit vector</li>
<li>angle between this and another vector, which is the inverse cosine of the dot product of the two vectors divided by both of their norms (in fact it may be useful to have a method for the cosine of the angle, for efficiency)</li>
<li>one that <em>might</em> be useful: the z-component of the cross product \$x_1 y_2-x_2 y_1\$</li>
</ul>

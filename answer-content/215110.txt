<h3>Separate logical elements</h3>

<p>The <code>calculateAverage</code> does multiple things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Calculate average</li>
<li>Return the computed value as a formatted string</li>
<li>Return a special string in case of missing user input</li>
</ul>

<p>It would be better to separate these elements.</p>

<p>Because these are not separated well,
the rest of the program has to work extra hard, for example:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>var averagesTotal = physicsAverage.value.slice(9) * 3 + historyAverage.value.slice(9) * 2;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Readers may be puzzled, and ask questions like:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Why do we need that <code>.slice(9)</code> there?</em></li>
<li><em>And where does that magic number 9 come from anyway?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Of course it's to chop off the <code>'Average: '</code> prefix from the value.
It would be much better if the rest of the program could work with numeric values directly, without having to do string manipulations.</p>

<p>And the way to do that is by using more functions,
cleanly separating computation and printing.</p>

<h3>Avoid magic numbers</h3>

<p>On the same line in the earlier example,
the physics average is multiplied by 3,
the history average is multiplied by 2.
<em>Why? Where do these values come from?
Are they correct like this?</em>
The purpose of these values,
and the intention of the program could become clear by giving them good,  descriptive names.</p>

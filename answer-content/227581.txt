  <p>Are there any security concerns with the current approach?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. You never interact with a server or a database. There is no way you could have any security concerns.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Focusing on the use of innerHTML here as I believe it could be
  potentially dangerous. Should I be creating elements instead of using
  text based HTML insertion?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No it does not matter. Users have access to this already. For example, on this webpage (codereview.stackexchange.com) you can right click an element and edit it. You can even edit the JavaScript. It's all client side. Users can always 'hack' themselves.</p>

<p>I recommend using an ENUM for your board pieces. This will help with readability.</p>

<p>This is a little picky, but I'd use a different variable name for <code>args</code>. Use descriptive names, don't name it <code>args</code> because you use it as an argument for a function. <code>args</code> is also used often inside of a main method in other languages.</p>

<p>Try to avoid <code>magic numbers</code>. Instead declare a static variable at the top. Or At the very least, add a comment describing what the number is.</p>

<pre><code>if (x &gt; 5)
    shade = "light";
</code></pre>

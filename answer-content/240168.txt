<h2>Typo</h2>

<p><code>databeicks_token_file</code> -&gt; <code>databricks_token_file</code></p>

<h2>Exceptions</h2>

<pre><code>        raise Exception(status_message)
</code></pre>

<p>is going to make it problematic for callers to meaningfully catch this separate from other exceptions, if they need to. Instead, raise a more specific exception, possibly a custom one - they're easy to define in Python.</p>

<h2>Global code</h2>

<pre><code>t1 = PythonOperator(
    task_id='get_authentication',
    python_callable=get_authentication,
    dag=dag
)


t2 = PythonOperator(
    task_id='run_notebook_job',
    python_callable=submit_job,
    dag=dag
)
t3 = PythonOperator(
    task_id='check_notebook_status',
    python_callable=check_status,
    dag=dag
)

t1.set_downstream(t2)
t2.set_downstream(t3)
</code></pre>

<p>should be pulled into a <code>main</code> function.</p>

<h2>Global variables</h2>

<p>These:</p>

<pre><code>auth_file = "my-token.txt"
idds_cluster_id_file = "my-cluster-id.txt"
path = "/airflow/tokens/"
cluster_id = "0408-000631"
path= "/airflow/tokens/"
temp_run_id_file = "my_save_run_id.txt"
databeicks_token_file= "databricks-token.txt"
auth_url = "https://snapdeal.com/authentication"
cluster_url = "https://snapdeal.com/clustermanager"
exec_url = "https://snapdeal.com/databricksexecutor"
</code></pre>

<p>are fine-ish where they are, though the names should be capitalized. These might also benefit from being pulled out into a configuration file or environment variables.</p>

<p>However, the rest of it (<code>args</code> through <code>search_dict</code>) probably doesn't belong here. <code>args</code> should just be moved to a nested literal initializer inside the <code>DAG</code> constructor; these other dictionaries should be passed - or parts of them passed, where appropriate - between functions. Having various functions mutate various keys in these dictionaries before they're passed to <code>requests</code> is not very maintainable. Something like <code>check_cluster_status</code> is better off constructing <code>cluster_status_dict</code> in its own scope.</p>

<p>The script looks pretty good to me.</p>

<p>The biggest issue is that if you plan to execute this code multiple times, it's not really efficient. I think you should check for existing persons in Snowflake, and then only add the persons that are not yet in there. I'm not sure how Snowflake works so I can't help you with that, but my approach would be to create a <code>Person</code> class, create a <code>__hash__</code> and an <code>__eq__</code> method, and put all existing persons in a <code>set</code>. Then for each person you read from Pipedrive, check if it is in the Persons set, and if it's not, add it to Snowflake. This would prevent costly <code>truncate</code> operations plus a lot of <code>insert</code> operations, in case you have a lot of persons in your Pipedrive.</p>

<p>Next, add some comments. The code should be self-explanatory so you could incorporate the steps you mentioned above as comments.</p>

<p>Finally, regarding global variables (PEP dictates they be capitalized):</p>

<ul>
<li>Rename <code>limit</code> to <code>PIPEDRIVE_PAGINATION_LIMIT</code></li>
<li>Remove the <code>start</code> variable and initialize <code>get_persons(start=0)</code></li>
<li>Put <code>start_time</code> under <code>if __name__ == "__main__"</code></li>
<li>Rename <code>csv_file</code> to <code>PIPEDRIVE_PERSONS_CSV</code></li>
</ul>

<p>For the commenting and global variables stuff, try linting your code, for example using <code>pylint</code>. It'll give you hints on what you can improve about your code.</p>

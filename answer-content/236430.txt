<p>Using a class might be too much. It all depends of how you want to use your script.</p>

<p>But I think you should take a look at mediainfo help. Issuing:</p>

<pre><code>mediainfo --Inform="Audio;%Encoded_Date%" Filename
</code></pre>

<p>outputs only the encoded date value of your audio file, or an empty line if not applicable. Maybe you won't need your script anymore.</p>

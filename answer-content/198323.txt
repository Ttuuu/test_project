<p>It sounds like you really need subscription plans to be data-driven. The methods you are defining on the concrete types are really just data. No need for concrete types. You need a better database table (and I use the term "table" loosely since you tagged the question with mongodb):</p>

<pre><code>| id | name   | max_subscription_quantity | commitment_period_num | commitment_period_type |
| 1  | Plan 1 | 120                       | 2                     | Month                  |
| 2  | Plan 2 | 50                        | NULL                  | NULL                   |
</code></pre>

<p>There really isn't a need for sub classes. Just one class ought to do it:</p>

<pre><code>class Payment::SubscriptionPlan
  def commitment_period
    # return period based on type and number
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>The only thing you need to define is <code>commitment_period</code> which does the calculation of the <code>commitment_period_num</code> and <code>commitment_period_type</code> columns.</p>

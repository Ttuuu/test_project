<ul>
<li>Formatting. Typically you want to use TSLint, and possible also Prettier. I've ran your code through Prettier with the standard configuration. (Note that the point is <em>consistency</em> and <em>readability</em>. It doesn't matter if you want to use <code>'</code> or <code>"</code>, tabs or spaces, etc)</li>
<li><code>this.messagePrefix ? this.messagePrefix : ""</code> can be simplified as <code>this.messagePrefix || ""</code></li>
<li>Looking at your code, it looks like we want to assign different values to <code>message</code> and <code>validator</code> depending on the values of <code>this.flight.inventory.code</code>. So lets keep everything else the same rather than having separate code paths. <em>If</em> we were to keep the current structure, then we should at least put the first assignment to <code>this.formGroup</code> in an else block, so we don't assign it twice.</li>

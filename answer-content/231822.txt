<p>In my opinion, this code is all right.  As any explicit code, these loops are quite straightforward to follow. And making it more concise will likely make it more cryptic as well. I would only make a minor brush-up, removing the unnecessary default clause and make the proper indentation. Variable interpolation is also more natural to read, in my opinion.</p>

<p>Also, variables must be explicitly initialized, just a mention is not enough. If you need an empty array then you must initialize an empty array. Although in the present code the <code>$errors</code> variable doesn't exist before the loop, the code could evolve over time, and there could be the possibility that a variable with the same name will be used above. If you just mention it, as <code>$errors;</code> it will keep the previous value. If you initialize it as <code>$errors = [];</code> you will always know it's an empty array. </p>

<pre><code>function generateErrorMessages($e)
{
    $errors = [];
    foreach ($e as $type =&gt; $array)
    {
        foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $values)
        {               
            foreach ($values as $v)
            {
                switch($type)
                {
                    case 'invalid':
                        $errors[$type][$key][] = "$v is not a valid $key";
                        break;
                    case 'missing':
                        $errors[$type][$key][] = "$v is a required $key - other functions have dependencies on it";
                        break;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return $errors;
}

<p>It looks like you're doing a lot of work to find the two largest and two smallest numbers in the array.  There is an easy way to offload that work to the standard library: just call <code>Array.Sort</code> on your input array.  Then your two lowest numbers will be at index <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>, and your two largest will be at index <code>length - 1</code> and <code>length - 2</code>.  That way you can condense your loops down to like 4 lines of code.  It takes your runtime from \$\mathcal{O}(n)\$ to \$\mathcal{O}(n \log n)\$ (I think the default array sort is \$\mathcal{O}(n \log n)\$), someone correct me if I'm wrong), but your implementation will look much more elegant and be easier to understand.</p>

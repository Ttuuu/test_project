<p>You could simplify your solution by concatenating the north/south letter with the east/west letter and thus avoid any need for <code>IsNorthEastHeading</code> and such like.</p>

<pre><code>string northsouth = (heading &lt; 23 || heading &gt; 337) ? "n" :
                    (heading &gt; 157 &amp;&amp; heading &lt; 203) ? "s" : 
                    "";
string eastwest = ...
return iconName + northsouth + eastwest + ICON_FILE_EXTENTION;
</code></pre>

<p>Is it really worth adding all those extra methods or introducing enums? Personally, I prefer this three line method over all of the much larger solutions proposed.</p>

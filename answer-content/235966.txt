<p>I can't be much help on the SQL front, but for VBA, I would recommend grouping your <code>Dim</code> statements, as it ultimately reduces compile time (scales well). 
For instance:</p>

<pre class="lang-vb prettyprint-override"><code>    Dim SelectClause As String
    Dim FromClause As String
    Dim WhereClause As String
    Dim OrderClause As String
    Dim FetchClause As String
</code></pre>

<p>Becomes</p>

<pre class="lang-vb prettyprint-override"><code>Dim SelectClause as String, FromClause As String, WhereClause As String, _
    OrderClause As String, FetchClause As String
</code></pre>

<p>Also, we can clean up this last Formatting module quite a bit. If this gets any bigger or either your destination range or your destination sheet changes, you'll be glad you refactored:</p>

<pre class="lang-vb prettyprint-override"><code>Public Sub AddHeaders()
Dim mySheet as Worksheet: Set mySheet = Sheet1

Dim labelText as Variant

'I'm putting linebreaks so that they are grouped nicely
labelText = Array("Customer Number", "First Name", "Middle Name", "Last Name", _
    "Street Address", "Street City", "Street State", "Street Zip", _
    "Mailing Address", "Mailing City", "Mailing State", "Mailing Zip", _
    "Home Phone", "Work Phone", _
    "TIN", "Customer Type", "Date of Birth", _
    "Email Address")

For i = 1 to UBound(labelText)
    mySheet.Cells(i, 1).Value = labelText(i)
Next i

End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>I'm a big fan of putting <code>Set</code> statements on the same line as <code>Dim</code> statements if it's a widely used variable throughout the procedure, as it is clearly an important statement.</p>

<p>Everything else looks good. Only other thing is that I prefer to put <code>Dim</code> statements outside of the loops if I can. Some people prefer putting them before assigning the variable, to keep track of local variables, but I always feel like it clutters loops. In this instance, you're using it to reset your Boolean so I'd leave it.</p>

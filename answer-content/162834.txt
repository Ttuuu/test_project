<p>Not a lot to review there;</p>

<p>The code is well documented and readable, the only thing I frowned at was <code>df[df == 0.0]</code>, but my Python is probably just not good enough.</p>

<p>In can only think of the fact that <code>replace</code> <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.replace.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">can take a list of strings</a> for to_replace, so you can merge the last 2 statements, which will give a speed up. </p>

<p>From a design perspective, all the routines writing to your database should never write empty lists, zeros, empty strings or nulls, but NaN instead. Then you would never have to run this script in the first place.</p>

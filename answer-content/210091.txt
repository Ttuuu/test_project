<p>This is a good start. Working from top to bottom here are some things I notice:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Minimal imports is usually a good sign, just make sure you aren't doing unnecessary work because <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0206/#batteries-included-philosophy" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python is batteries included</a></p></li>
<li><p>Classes are a good way to organize things, but I would suggest that you add some default values to your initializers, and potentially some verification that values are valid (e.g. can <code>x</code>/<code>y</code>/<code>radius</code> be negative, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p><code>if s1_WaitToStart is True:</code> can just be <code>if s1_WaitToStart:</code> (this happens a lot in the code you provided)</p></li>
<li><p>Global variables are (usually) bad. I would consider wrapping them in a <code>Config</code>  or <code>State</code> object</p></li>
<li><p>I would wrap the <code>while run:</code> block in a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">top-level environment</a></p></li>
<li><p><code># STATES OF GAME PLAY *************************************************************************************************</code> oof</p></li>
</ul>

<p>At this point we've made it pretty far into your example and things are looking alright. But usually a long comment dividing up some code indicates that things are getting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell" rel="nofollow noreferrer">smelly</a>. I would think about how you keep track of the game's state with its own object, and refactor your ball mechanics into reusable functions. Really just breaking up the game logic loop that you have would make this more digestible to the reader, and closer to what someone with software engineering experience would expect. Adding comments is (usually) a good thing as well. To help you think about what behavior lends itself to good code, ask yourself if the code you're writing would scale to 2, 5, 10, 100+ users, and if you would be able to jump back into the block you're in the middle of after a month without looking at it.</p>

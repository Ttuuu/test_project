<p>Without doing a full re-write:</p>

<p>Are the methods in your helper classes static? Are they used elsewhere? Can they be made static in their home class? You may want to statically import these helper classes if they are not holding state.</p>

<p>You have a lot of indirection (a.b.c()) fetching the same objects repeatedly - consider putting these in variables before you use them. this will clean up the code and might reveal another method you can extract</p>

<p>Is there any reason movePoint() cannot just return a Waypoint?</p>

<p>There is a lot of common code in the if and else clauses - can this be extracted as a single method that takes the single letter flag?</p>

<p>You can just assign the finishing condition check to the finish variable and get rid of the if clause.</p>

<p>Overall - try to aim for a top level method that 'describes the algorithm' then use subordinate methods to take care of sub-operations.</p>

<p>You should be able to do this with a simple update command, no loops at all, something like this:</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE Account SET [BillingCountry]  = &lt;&lt; some expression &gt;&gt;
where isnull(BillingCountry,'') not in ( 'United States', 'Canada' )
</code></pre>

<p>I would recommend writing a function to compute the country, it probably makes it easier to test the results are correct before running the update. The function would take as parameters the City, State and Zipcode ( and perhaps the current value of Country if you you want that to be the result if it cannot be computed ), and return the computed country ( based on the CityStateInfo table you have ).</p>

<p>This should run pretty fast, within a few seconds, provided the CityStateInfo table is appropriately indexed ( on both City,State_abbr and also on Zip ).</p>

<p>Your expression for matching seems to be redundant:</p>

<pre><code>   (City = @city AND State_abbr = @state) OR 
          (City = @city AND Zip = LEFT(@zip,5)) OR
          (Zip = LEFT(@zip,5))
</code></pre>

<p>The middle line can be removed.</p>

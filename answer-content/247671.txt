<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle" rel="nofollow noreferrer">S</a> from SOLID objects should have only one responsibility. Therefore I would move draw and input logic from current objects into a separate one. It could be something like UI and InputController classes. The idea here is to hide all I/O related stuff in a way that allows changing I/O without changing game logic. It is a very common problem and popular solution is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller" rel="nofollow noreferrer">MVC</a></p>
<p>Another thing that I would improve is the code in the main function - it could be moved into Game class. Game class may contain UI, InputController, and GameLogic (the place were all game rules live)</p>

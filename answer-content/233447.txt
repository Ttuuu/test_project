<p>I would remove the first line break at the top of each stage to condense it, then re-add it when printing out.</p>

<pre><code>clear()
</code></pre>

<p>I would remove this as users' usually don't like having their terminal cleared unexpectedly. </p>

<pre><code>    def next_stage(self) -&gt; bool:
        """ Returns if this stage is the last """

        self.current_stage += 1

        if self.current_stage &lt; len(STAGES) - 1:
            return True

        return False
</code></pre>

<p>This can be simplified to <code>self.current_stage += 1</code> then <code>return self.current_stage &lt; len(STAGES) - 1</code>.</p>

<p><code>.lower()</code> is called four times; the user's input should be lower-cased before processing so that <code>.lower()</code> doesn't have to be called again. This would require <code>self.letters = [chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + 26)]</code> to just have lowercase letters so that <code>.lower()</code> can be removed in the loop that checks if the characters are in the list containing capitals.</p>

<pre><code>            print()
            input('Press enter to continue...')

            if x == 0 or x == 2:
                return
</code></pre>

<p>This can be removed and replaced with "Do you want to play again?" If the user enters yes, then they can otherwise not. If the functionality is that the user keeps playing until they either win or lose, then it could be different.</p>

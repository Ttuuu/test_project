<p>Welcome to Code Review! Hopefully you find the feedback here and in other posts useful!</p>
<h2>Good things</h2>
<p>The code makes good use of <code>const</code> for items that shouldn't be re-assigned (e.g. <code>screen</code>, <code>btnStart</code>, <code>screen</code>, etc.) and <code>let</code> for re-assignable values (e.g. <code>counter</code>, <code>intervalID</code>).</p>
<h2>Suggestions</h2>
<p>This code uses some ES6 features like arrow functions - thus it could use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes" rel="nofollow noreferrer">class syntax</a>. Until then, each instance of <code>StopWatch</code> has methods defined using <code>this.[method]</code>. This works but isn't as efficient as using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the prototype</a>. Such a change might likely require changing local variables to instance variables (e.g. <code>screen</code> =&gt; <code>this.screen</code>).</p>
<p>The naming of methods on <code>UI</code> could be more appropriate - e.g. <code>toggleClass</code> would be more appropriate as <code>toggleActiveClass</code> because it toggles the <code>activeBtn</code> class, and <code>removeClass</code> would be more appropriate as <code>removeActiveClass</code> for the same reason.</p>
<p>I see that the Error is thrown when clicking the button with text <em>Start</em> twice, which makes sense, but perhaps the click event handler should only call the function <code>sw.start</code> (as well as <code>ui.toggleClass(this)</code>) if <code>intervalID === 0</code> - if that is a case then perhaps a public method to determine if the Stopwatch is started is necessary.</p>
<p>I noticed the HTML for the buttons labeled <em>Stop</em> and <em>Reset</em> have attributes on the close tag:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>&lt;button type="submit" id="btnStop" class="btn"&gt;Stop&lt;/button type="submit"&gt;
&lt;button type="submit" id="btnReset" class="btn"&gt;Reset&lt;/button type="submit"&gt;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Setting attributes on the closing tags will either be ignored by the browser, or could lead to an error - see answers to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/4138006/1575353">this SO question</a> for more of an explanation.</p>

<p>Your professor is correct. This is really hard to read, and is structured somewhat oddly.</p>

<p>Here is an assortment of comments, left mostly in the order from top to bottom as I found them.</p>

<ol>
<li>Don't <code>using namespace std;</code>. This has been discussed at length on this site and elsewhere, so I'm not going to leave any additional context here.</li>
<li><code>Expression::Value</code> is a bit weird; if this is important you should make <code>Expression&lt;T&gt;</code>. The name <code>ValueType</code> is probably better too.</li>
<li>You should take strings by reference when they're parameters.</li>
<li>Your list of whitespace seems incomplete</li>
<li>I don't love declaring multiple variables per line</li>
<li>The general idea <code>!(abs(expr) &gt; numeric_limits&lt;int&gt;::max()) ? expr : throw runtime_error</code> should be encapsulated in a helper function, and not done in a ternary expression</li>
<li>I don't see a good reason why exponentiation needs an anonymous function</li>
<li>All your magic numbers (I think they're string indices?) should be well named constants so it can be understood</li>
<li>A few of your while loops could probably be for loops</li>
<li>It might be nice to implement <code>operator&lt;&lt;</code> </li>
<li>Most of your member functions should be <code>const</code></li>
<li>The getter methods on <code>Token</code> are pointless and should be removed</li>
<li><code>Token</code> and <code>TokenType</code> don't seem like they should be public.</li>
</ol>

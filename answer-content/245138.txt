<p>I see no benefit to any of these approaches. You're just making yourself write more code. All you need is one class that analyzes a website entered from a user. If you have a predefined list of websites that you need to scrape, then iterate over each website instead of using a class for each one.</p>
<p>Since you say there are two ways of accomplishing this task, you can have the user pass in what mode they want to use to get the information. Something like</p>
<pre><code>website = Scraper("https://www.google.com", "DIRECT")
website = Scraper("https://www.website_here.com/articles/article.pdf", "PDF")
</code></pre>
<p>Then you build your class around it. You want your code to be easily accessible and usable by a user. As a first time user, I would have no idea if I should use <code>Website1</code> or <code>Website2</code>. What are the differences? Why should I use one over the other? You should always look at your code through the lens of a user.</p>

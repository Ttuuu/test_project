<p>@Martin Frank has given you a few things to think about, so I'm only going to add a couple of points.  Firstly, use consistent formatting it makes a difference for readability. Most IDE's will do this for you automatically.  As it stands, you have some method signatures that have spaces between <code>) {</code> and some that don't <code>){</code>.</p>
<p>Secondly, your <code>Book</code> class has a bunch of private fields, that don't have getters, or any methods that operate on them other than the constructor that set's them.  Consider not adding fields until they're actually needed, it'll save you time in the long run.</p>
<p>Finally, consider these methods:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>public void pageForward(){
    resumedPage++;
    setResumedPage(resumedPage);
}
public void setResumedPage(int resumedPage) {
    this.resumedPage = resumedPage;
}
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Your <code>pageForward</code> increments the <code>resumedPage</code> field then calls the properties setter to set the field to the value that the field already has.  You don't need to call <code>setResumedPage</code> in this scenario, since <code>resumedPage</code> already has the same value...</p>

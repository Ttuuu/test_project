<p>Algorithm is not correct for directed graphs, but it would work for undirected graphs. Consider a graph like one below. It is acyclic (DAG) but your code will detect a cycle. <a href="https://gist.github.com/arekbulski/fd95148d421d9882e03d" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Test case here.</a></p>

<p>The correct approach would be: Two dictionaries are needed, pre and post. When you start processing a vertex (just got to it) mark it in pre. After you finished processing a vertex (just processed its adjacents) mark it in post. When processing adjacent vertices, if you find a vertex marked in pre but not marked in post, you found a cycle. </p>

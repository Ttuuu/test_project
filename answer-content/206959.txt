<p>I've thought about the unholy union of D3 and React before, and I would be careful. I'd say that so far, your code looks fine, and if you know with a high degree of certainty you won't need much more than this, then you're fine.</p>

<p>However, I suspect you've only gotten started, and it's all the future improvements that will leave you banging your head (especially input handlers and animations).</p>

<p>I don't think the problem is that D3 doesn't like playing with React (although I know there are quirks), but rather that charts are a complex subject. They have their own abstract language, and most people aren't fluent. </p>

<p>You might consider using the new <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/chart-parts" rel="nofollow noreferrer">chart-parts</a>. If you want a better foundation to build on, you might look at wrapping <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Vega</a> in your own components. Or you might want to just see what else is out there: <a href="https://npms.io/search?q=react+charts" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://npms.io/search?q=react+charts</a>.</p>

<p>Here's a great video with a deeper explanation of my warnings: <a href="https://youtu.be/qqffsEHKMcM" rel="nofollow noreferrer">The Missing Abstraction of Charting - Chris Trevino - React Conf 2018</a></p>

<p>Cleaner and clearer it can certainly be:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>your function is called <code>isFrameMatchedByFilter</code> but returns true if there is no filter in the filter list: does that mean the frame is matched by a void filter? It's rather unclear, you need to either find another name or change the behavior of the function.</p></li>
<li><p>your argument is called <code>frameToFilter</code>, but it's a bad idea. First because there's only one frame in this function and <code>frame</code> is shorter than <code>frameToFilter</code>; second because <code>frameToFilter</code> can also be interpreted as a kind of transformation from a frame to a filter (like in <code>to_string</code> for instance). </p></li>
<li><p>the whole loop could be subsumed in a named algorithm: either <code>std::any_of</code>, or, if you change the semantics a bit, <code>std::find_if</code>: it might be interesting to return the matching filter rather than a simple <code>bool</code>. You then only need to compare the return iterator to <code>filter_list.end()</code> to produce a <code>bool</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>the mask system comes with a cognitive cost. What <code>(frameToFilter.frameId() &amp; filter.frameId) != (filter.frameId &amp; filter.frameIdMask)</code> could possibly mean, I've no substantial idea. A function, or even a simple lambda to enlighten the reader would be nice. It would also encapsulate this calculation, and you could change this to a more robust system (like an <code>enum</code> -but I don't know the context, so it might not be the right choice) afterwards.</p></li>
<li><p>this kind of things: <code>!(frameToFilter.hasExtendedFrameFormat() == (filter.format == QCanBusDevice::Filter::FormatFilter::MatchExtendedFormat))</code> is too clever. Again, write a one-liner around it or at least write it a way a mere mortal can read (I mean, without a 50% chance not to understand it correctly).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Can it be faster? It depends on several factors: you can rearrange the match conditions to have the fastest * most discriminating first if it isn't already done (but it looks like the right order); you can sort the filters by id and perform a binary search rather than a flat one; you can go parallel if there are a lot of them. But as always, only optimize if it's worth it -measure first.</p>

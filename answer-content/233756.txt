<p>I don't know if this is just an exercise to learn about working with strings and numbers, or if you ever intend to use this to generate real passwords. But if you do, this line can be a serious problem:</p>

<pre><code>srand((unsigned int)(time(NULL)));
</code></pre>

<p>Since you are using the current time, in seconds, to seed the pseudo-random number generator, you have severly limited the number of possible passwords. If I know which day you ran this program to generate a password, there are only 86400 possible passwords I need to test. That's an entropy of 16 bits. If I can guess the hour, you are down to 12 bits. And if I know the exact time, perhaps because your mail with encrypted text has it in the headers, I <em>know</em> your password.</p>

<p>(<code>RAND_MAX</code> is only guaranteed by the standard to be at least 32767, which would correspond to 15 bits of entropy, but on my machine it is 2147483647, which is 31 bits of entropy.)</p>

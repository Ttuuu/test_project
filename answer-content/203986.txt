<p>The line you are using is telling the engine, redirect everything to the following URI. The reason for this is that you are using the pattern matching wildcard (.*). </p>

<p>The parenthesis is used for creating groups, the dot is telling the engine that every character is accepted and the star symbol is telling the engine that it can be of unlimited length. By using the forward slash followed by another wildcard group, you are redirecting every URI request to the following URI "<a href="https://google.com/release/theme/5.0.1/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://google.com/release/theme/5.0.1/</a>$1/$2".</p>

<p>Instead of using </p>

<pre><code>RewriteRule ^(.*)/(.*) "https://google.com/release/theme/5.0.1/$1/$2" [R=302,L]
</code></pre>

<p>You should replace it with the following line</p>

<pre><code>RewriteRule ^v5/(.*)$ https://google.com/release/theme/5.0.1/$1 [R=302,L]
</code></pre>

<p>Why append the 'v5' before the caret symbol (^)?
The caret symbol matches the start of a string. In our case, the string is the version. </p>

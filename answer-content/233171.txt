<p>I am not going to go through all of the code - instead I'll give you some basic information. This is not meant to be an answer, just more typing than a comment will allow. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Name your modules. </p></li>
<li><p>Use better indentation. Even though whitespace is ignored, that doesnt mean you shouldn't have tidier looking code as well. </p></li>
<li><p>Since you're new to VBA I'll explain an important concept. Learning to work in memory is very important. Having to interact with the application's "objects" will significantly slow down your code. For example, you do lots of sheet manipulation in module4 and module2 - does this actuall need to occur? or is it OCD? Or could it be done all at once? Just some things to think about. When possilbe, learn to use arrays where you can. This leads to the next point...</p></li>
<li><p>OptimizeCodeBegin and OptimizeCodeEnd - its good that your jamming things into functions and subs. You'll eventaully start building your own personal library of functions and classes. You may even have seperate files that you will use as a class/library repository that you can reference from other projects. However, these two specifically point out an issue in your code. In Excel's object model, these properties that youre turning off/on are a symptom of poor performing code. Using these often a tell tale sign of the need to do a code rewrite. Another big issue with them is that if your code bombs and they dont get turned back on, you have to restart excel to get back to proper funcitonality. Which leads me to the next point:</p></li>
<li><p>Error handling - where is it? </p></li>
<li><p>Learn what late binding is. Its a common interview question to test your knowledge but more importantly late binding is helpful when you do not know whether or not there will be version differences of excel (especially if youre distributing documents). This isnt relevant to your code per say, but its something you need to know how to use and understand when/why you would need to use it. </p></li>

<p>I think the past two answers cover most of what I'd say however I do have a suggestion to condense the amount of code you've written. Just thinking you could implement the numbers 0-9 in a 1D JButton array. Seems a little pointless creating the buttons individually when they're all so similar. Will save all that code in the constructor too. I'm fairly certain this will work as I did something similar when creating a grid for an implementation of Conways Game of Life.</p>

<p>To speed it up a fraction more add <code>double dIteration = aIteration/cIteration;</code> and <code>double d = a/c;</code> before the loop. In the loop remove <code>a</code> and <code>c</code> and insert</p>

<pre><code>      d*= dIteration;
      ln += d/b;
</code></pre>

<p>You then have one multiplication, one division and an addition in the loop, cutting out two excess multiplications in your version. </p>

<p>Edit: you can get further optimization (though perhaps outside the scope of your question) if you look at maths of your series. For <code>1/sqrt(10) &lt; x &lt;= sqrt(10)</code> you only need around 20 terms (because the ratio between successive terms is<code>$&lt;0.26</code>). For <code>x</code> outside this range, find an <code>n</code> such th at <code>x_0*10**n = x</code> such that <code>x_0</code> is in this range (by repeated division or multiplication by 10) and use <code>ln(x) = ln(x_0) + n*ln(10)</code>.</p>

<p>Now that the OP has clarified that they intend to use this as a teaching tool, my answer has lost relevance for their use-case. It can still be taken as general advice for most Python modules.</p>

<p>I do agree with @jpmc26 to a certain extent, specifically that this code itself as currently written should not be used as an example for new learners of Python. I am certainly not advocating teaching students bad Python style. But I think that this could be a useful learning aid within the context the OP provides.</p>

<h2>Original answer</h2>

<p>I realize this is one of the central premises of your program, but printing help docstrings during normal use of the program is highly unusual behavior and likely to be annoying to users of your program. For example, a user might already know how to use your API, and doesn't need to be told how every time they invoke it; it would just clutter up the command line. Besides, you're solving a problem that doesn't really need to be solved: a class docstring may scroll the screen as described, but function and method docstrings do not, and the Python REPL interpreter already allows you to short circuit the scrolling.</p>

<p>Instead, I would recommend using more descriptive and helpful docstrings. For example, informing the user of the class calling conventions in isolation is not useful; explaining what the class's intended use is, and what the various parameters mean would be more useful. <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP 257</a> provides guidance on how to write good docstrings.</p>

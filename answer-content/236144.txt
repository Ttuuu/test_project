<p>I don't know of any coding standards or other reasons why you should have to move it higher. Generally it's just personal preference and whichever is more readable.</p>

<p>As for the fact that you'd need to create a variable unnecessarily in some cases, creating a variable like this uses very little memory so it shouldn't be an issue unless the function is being looped over thousands of times. </p>

<p>You could also consider another option, which is to use a ternary rather than mutating a variable:
<code>let prefix = phoneNumberString.startsWith('49') ? '49' : ''</code></p>

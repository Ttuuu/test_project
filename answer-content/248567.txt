<p>There are many things that, honestly, I don't consider best practices. In detail:</p>
<p>a) Using a grid seems not necessary there: such a structure could be realised with flex box only. It would have better compatibility.</p>
<p>b) I can't tell if nesting grids is considered a best practice either but this code does not get advantage of SASS in its nesting. Classes should have been written like this:</p>
<pre><code>.label {
  &amp;-item { }
  &amp;-imageContainer { }
  &amp;-info { }
  &amp;-description { }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Moreover the div.label-info contains 2 spans and 1 div but, since all three are block-level elements, they should be divs.</p>
<p>c) Aligning with Flexbox is the right way but, as I said before, using Flexbox alone, without Grid, should have been a better practice.</p>
<p>I would also add that, since he's using Grid, all the floats are useless.</p>

<p>I think the modified date doesn't change when the file is moved to #Recycle area, so if the file is already older than 60 days, it will deleted the next time the script runs.</p>

<p>I have observed that the 'change' date gets reset when moved to a new directory. Do a 'stat' or 'ls -lc' of the file before and after moving to different directory and you should see the 'change' date reset to current time, while the 'modified' date does not change.</p>

<p>I haven't had time to figure out how to modify the script to use 'change' time instead of 'modfied' time, but I bet some clever person could code that. Using the 'change' date should give you the full 60 days to recover the file.</p>

<p>--- update 2020.June.3 ---
Looks as though the recent update to DSM, 6.2.3-25426, may have fixed Synology's method for purging the #recycle area based on how many days have passed since items were moved to the #recycle area.
I had been tinkering with a find command for searching for aged files &amp; folders but not deleting them, only to find that after the update, almost all the aged files, over 60 days, got purged and a bunch of my free disk space was reclaimed.</p>

<p>Anyway .. the core method that seemed to be finding the 60 day aged files in the #recycle bin, though I had not tested with '-delete'</p>

<p>find /volume1/Data/#recycle -depth -mindepth 1 -ctime +60 -type f -print -delete</p>

<p>find /volume1/Data/#recycle -depth -mindepth 1 -type d -empty -print -delete</p>

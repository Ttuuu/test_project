<p>Not a coding issue exactly, but this is missing a lot of words that should not be capitalized.  In particular, you only have one of the seven <a href="http://www.chompchomp.com/terms/coordinatingconjunction.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">coordinating conjunctions</a>, one of three articles, and two prepositions.  <a href="https://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/capitalizing-titles?page=1" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Grammar Girl</a> suggests </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“a,” “an,” “and,” “at,” “but,” “by,” “for,” “in,” “nor,” “of,” “on,” “or,” "out," “so,” “the,” “to,” “up,” and “yet.”</p>

<p>She says this is from <em>AP</em> style (which the Associated Press apparently no longer uses).  </p>

<p>Incidentally, you should also be capitalizing the last word of the title (as well as the first).  Your two examples have nouns as the last word, so this gets capitalized correctly.  You may want to add an example where the word is in the lower case list.  E.g. "If it's the last word of the title, should I capitalize 'the'?"  </p>

<p>If you were trying to implement the <em>Chicago</em> style, this would be much more complicated, as there are some words that can be prepositions, adjectives, or adverbs depending on usage.  In <em>Chicago</em> style, you have to parse the sentence grammar to determine what gets capitalized.  Also, <em>Chicago</em> style uses lower case for prepositions with four letters or more.  So there are far more of them.  </p>

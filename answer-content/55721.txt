<p>I don't like</p>

<pre><code>public static Die [] rollDice(Die [] dieArray){
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; dieArray.length; i++){
        dieArray[i] = new Die ();
        dieArray[i].roll();
        dieArray[i].faceValue = dieArray[i].getValue();
    }
    return dieArray;
}
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>You are both modifying <code>dieArray</code> and returning it.  Either modify it and return nothing, or just take an argument which is a number of dice and return a new array.</p></li>
<li><p>You are creating a <code>new Die()</code> for each element of the array.  Either already have an array with existing dice, create a whole new array.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I also don't like <code>checkForYahtzee</code>.  Simpler is:</p>

<pre><code>int value0 = dieArray[0].getValue();
for(int i = 1; i &lt; dieArray.length; i++)
   if (dieArray[i].getValue() != value0)
      return false;
return true;
</code></pre>

<p>My last comment is a bit more advanced, and is somewhat inappropriate for your assignment: I would not define a <code>Die</code> class at all.  You really only need to generate lists (of some given length) of random integers between 1 and 6.  I would just write a method that does this and it would be sufficient, not to mention that it would be more efficient.  However, you should probably not do this on your homework since your instructor would probably take many points off and tell you that you really don't get object oriented programming.</p>

<p>You can get rid of some instructions by writing this instead:</p>

<pre><code>count_down = 3
while (count_down):
   print(count_down)
   count_down -=  1
print('Action!')
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I have replaced <code>countDown</code> by <code>count_down</code> to comply with <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions" rel="noreferrer">PEP8' naming conventions</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Code explanation:</strong></p>

<p><code>count_down -= 1</code> is equivalent to <code>count_down = count_down - 1</code>. You can read more on <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_basic_operators.htm" rel="noreferrer">Python basic operators.</a></p>

<p>You do not need to check within the while loop if <code>count_down</code> reached the 0 value because it is already done when you coded <code>while (countDown&gt;=0)</code>. I mean you are duplicating the checking. In order to keep <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" rel="noreferrer">DRY</a>, I just decrement the value of <code>count_down</code> by 1 and the <code>break</code> instruction is done by default as I am testing <code>while(count_down)</code> meaning if <code>count_down != 0</code> in <strong>this</strong> context (because it also means while <code>count_down</code> is not <code>False</code> or <code>None</code>).</p>

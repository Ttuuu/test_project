<p>When you make your alphabet <code>static</code> there is no need to declare the variable as a pointer and then assigning it an actual pointer to a string in an anonymous array (which is also static).</p>

<pre><code>#define MAX_BASE() strlen(alphabet)
static char const *alphabet = "0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
</code></pre>

<p>You can as well declare the alphabet explicitly as an array:</p>

<pre><code>static char const alphabet[] = "0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
</code></pre>

<p>and then you don't need to scan it with <code>strlen</code> each time you invoke the conversion, because the size of the array is constant and known at compile time:</p>

<pre><code>#define MAX_BASE() (sizeof alphabet - 1)
</code></pre>

<p>However, if you need a variable-length alphabet, then you need to keep two variables, one <code>const char*</code> for the alphabet itself, and one <code>int</code> to store its length. Then you can re-assign the alphabet at run-time, but scan it with <code>strlen()</code> just once on each assignment instead of on each use.</p>

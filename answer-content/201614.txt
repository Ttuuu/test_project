<p>You didn't specify which version of Laravel is used, so I am going to presume it is 5.x. If that is incorrect, please notify me and update your post with such relevant information</p>

<p>I am not sure exactly how to reduce the queries for comments but the suggestion below should allow remove the loop of queries for the user on each game.</p>

<h3>Eager Loading</h3>

<p>(Nested) <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/eloquent-relationships#eager-loading" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Eager Loading</a> - utilizing the <a href="https://laravel.com/api/5.6/Illuminate/Database/Eloquent/Builder.html#method_with" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>with()</code></a> method - can be used to populate the <code>user</code> property for each item in the collection:</p>

<pre><code>$games = Game::join('comments', 'games.id', '=', 'comments.commentable_id')
-&gt;where('comments.commentable_type', Game::class)
-&gt;latest('comments.created_at')
-&gt;groupBy('games.id')
-&gt;take(10)
-&gt;with('comment.user')
-&gt;withCount('comments')
</code></pre>

<h3>Variable naming</h3>

<p>The lambda/closure passed to <a href="https://laravel.com/api/5.6/Illuminate/Support/Collection.html#method_each" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>each()</code></a> accepts a parameter named <code>$games</code>. Isn't it actually a representation of a <em>game</em>? If so, <code>$game</code> would be more appropriate. Additionally, other developers reading the code may be confused because <code>$games</code> is also used for the assignment of the collection.</p>

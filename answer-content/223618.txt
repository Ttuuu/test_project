<p><strong>Unused Includes</strong><br>
The code is not using <em>std:vector</em>, nor is it using anything from <em>utilities</em>. It might be better not to include these, that can improve your compile time and decrease the size of the generated code.</p>

<p><strong>Don't Repeat Yourself</strong><br>
There are two obvious functions that can be written to shorten the code in <code>main()</code>. One function prints the contents of an unordered map and the other moves the contents from one map to the other. When you see code repeating itself in a function that is a good indication that you can create a function to reduce the amount of code in the function to make it simpler.</p>

<p><strong>Program Exit Status</strong><br>
In this particular program it isn't necessary to have <code>return 0</code>; in <code>main()</code> C++ will generate it for you. When you have programs that might fail it might be better to include <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/program/EXIT_status" rel="nofollow noreferrer">cstdlib and use the symbolic constants EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE</a> to indicate success or failure to the calling program.</p>

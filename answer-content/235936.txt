<p><code>solve()</code> shouldn't print anything, much less all the intermediate results.
It should end with <code>return ans</code> and the main program should print that final result.</p>

<p>You'll get the same answer for (i,j) as for (j,i), so for the inner loop j never needs to be less than i.</p>

<p>The expression <code>abs(l[i] - l[j]) + abs(i - j)</code> gets calculated twice.  Instead, assign the value to a temporary variable and use that twice.</p>

<p>David G.'s suggestion, of finding the maximum possible contribution of the <code>l[i] - l[j]</code> term and using that to restrict the range of i and j, is perhaps the most effective optimization.</p>

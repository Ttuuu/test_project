<p>A quick code inspection with MZ-Tools reveals the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Local variables <code>names</code>, <code>fieldValues</code> and <code>row</code> can be safely removed from the <code>Create</code> method.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's all the tool is picking up though.</p>

<p>I like how it makes everything <em>automagical</em>, however if it were the only way to get the data I'd be worried about performance with some large recordsets. The <code>List</code> class makes it easier to find a value by field name, but the <em>search</em> for the field name happens every time, which means lots of time is <s>spent</s> <em>wasted</em> finding the same field index over and over again, for each record. Keeping the index for each name in a <code>Dictionary&lt;String,int&gt;</code> would be more efficient than having to search for each column index for each row.</p>

<p>That said, <code>SqlCommand</code> has methods that take a <code>ADODB.Connection</code> and output a <code>ADODB.Recordset</code>, having the possibility to use these methods for larger recordsets and let the client code deal with the connection and the recordset, somewhat makes up for the performance hit of the wrapper <code>SqlResult</code>; you get the <em>automagical</em> parameters <em>and</em> the possibility to only iterate the data once.</p>

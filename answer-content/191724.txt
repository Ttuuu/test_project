<p>To augment the other good answers already given, here's a short version that utilizes several of the already given ideas, as well as a couple additional ones:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; spam = ['apples', 'bananas', 'tofu', 'cats']
&gt;&gt;&gt; comma_code = lambda l: ", ".join(l[:-1] + ['and ' + l[-1]])
&gt;&gt;&gt; comma_code(spam)
'apples, bananas, tofu, and cats'
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>lambda</code> clause is a shorthand method for defining smaller functions, rather than using the full <code>def ...</code> syntax.</p>

<p>It also uses list slicing, and both string and list concatenation. As long as you know your input list is only strings, this should be fine, but if you're unsure of especially the last element in the list, one of the approaches using <code>.format()</code> could be integrated just as well.</p>

<p>Update: just realized this will fail for lists of less than two items. So that's another assumption you'd have to make on your input. Wrapping the above in a slightly larger function that dealt with the two corner cases would be relatively easy to do.</p>

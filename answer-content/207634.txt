<p>To expand on <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/207618/98493">the answer</a> given by <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/141774/aries-is-there">@Aries_is_there</a> in, you should indeed make your dictionary a nested dictionary with the item names as first keys and the item properties as keys of the sub dictionaries.</p>

<p>You should also be aware that <code>x in inventory</code> is <span class="math-container">\$\mathcal{O}(n)\$</span> if <code>inventory</code> is a list, but this is mitigated when making it a dictionary, because <code>x in items</code> is <span class="math-container">\$\mathcal{O}(1)\$</span> for dictionaries.</p>

<p>Your printing can also be simplified by using an <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>f-string</code></a>.</p>

<p>I would also add a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/419163/what-does-if-name-main-do"><code>if __name__ == "__main__"</code></a> guard to allow importing functions form this script from another script.</p>

<p>And finally, Python has an official style-guide, <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP8</a>, which is well worth a read. You are already mostly following it, except for the missing spaces after the <code>:</code> in your dictionaries.</p>

<pre><code>items = {"apple": {"name": "apple",
                   "type": "fruit",
                   "edible": "edible",
                   "color": "red"},
         "tire": {"name":"tire",
                  "type":"object",
                  "edible":"not edible",
                  "color":"grey"}}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Choose an item to examine. Items in your inventory are:")
    print(*items.keys(), sep = ", ")

    while True:
        x = input()

        if x in inventory:
            #if the input matches something you have, find the attributes of
            #the item in the inventory and print them.
            item = items[x]
            print(f"This is a {item['color']} {item['name']}, a type of {item['type']}. It is {item['edible']}.")
        elif x == "quit":
            #if the player wishes to quit, end the program.
            break
        else:
            #if the item is not recognized, let the player know.
            print("You don't have that in your inventory.")
</code></pre>

<p>You could take it one level further by making it object-oriented. In this case you would probably want an <code>Object</code> class for which you define the <a href="https://www.python-course.eu/python3_magic_methods.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">magic <code>__str__</code> method</a>, which controls what happens if you do <code>print(x)</code>.</p>

<pre><code>class Object:
    def __init__(self, name, type="object", edible=False, color=None):
        self.name = name
        self.type = type
        self.edible = edible
        self.color = color

    def __str__(self):
        s = ["This is a "]
        if self.color is not None:
            s.append(self.color + " ")
        s.extend([self.name, f", a type of {self.type}."]
        s.append(f"It is {'not ' if not self.edible else ''}edible.")
        return "".join(s)


items = {"apple": Object("apple", "fruit", edible=True, color="red"),
         "tire": Object("tire", color="grey")}

    print("Choose an item to examine. Items in your inventory are:")

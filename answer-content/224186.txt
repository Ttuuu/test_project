<h1>serializing</h1>
<p>You are serializing <em>all</em> HTML text and sending it back to the parent.
That can be time consuming.</p>
<p>Consider having the child (<code>my_function()</code>) write HTML text to a file in <code>/tmp</code>,
and pass back the temporary filename to the parent.
Better, also pass back some timestamps: <code>(start, end, filename)</code></p>
<h1>stragglers</h1>
<p>If you can predict that a page will be "big" or a site will be "slow",
sort those to the front of your list of 500 URLs.
That way you won't have a handful of sluggish stragglers
impacting your overall time,
while most cores are idle and waiting for them to complete.</p>

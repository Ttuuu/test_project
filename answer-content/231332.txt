<p>In <code>entrypoint.sh</code>, I prefer to have <code>set -eu</code> in line 2 instead of passing it in line 1. That way it is guaranteed to be set no matter how the program is run.</p>

<p>Because of this <code>set -e</code>, you can omit the <code>&amp;&amp; \</code>, since that code is neither in a subshell nor in a function. (The <code>set -e</code> mode is unreliable in either of them, I don't remember the exact rules though.)</p>

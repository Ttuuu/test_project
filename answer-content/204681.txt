<p>In a program <em>comment</em> it is said that the program</p>

<pre><code># Accepts any date/time format accepted by 'date'
</code></pre>

<p>That information should be printed with the <em>usage help,</em> plus one or two examples. Something like</p>

<pre>
$ ./sleep_until.sh --help
Usage: ./sleep_until.sh TIME

    TIME can be any date/time as accepted by date(1).

Examples:

    ...    
</pre>

<p>That'll save me from looking into the source code (and possibly from
looking up <code>man date</code>) in order to figure out the correct parameters.</p>

<hr>

<p>Due to the truncation in </p>

<pre><code>test ${end%.*} -gt ${now%.*} || die "$1 is in the past!"
</code></pre>

<p>there is a (albeit small) chance that a valid date is not recognized.
This can be avoided by computing the delay first, and then checking
it to be positive (e.g. as in <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/24728">How to compare to floating point number in a shell script</a>):</p>

<pre><code>end=$(date -d "$1" +%s.%N)
now=$(date +%s.%N)
delay=$(echo $end - $now | bc)
test 1 -eq $(echo "$delay &gt; 0" | bc) || die "$1 is in the past!"
exec sleep $delay
</code></pre>

<p>Note: I'm using <code>bc</code> rather than <code>dc</code> here just because I needed it for the check <code>$delay &gt; 0</code> and found a <code>bc</code>-based solution first (and then I did not want to use two different tools). Also I am a little bit more familiar with <code>bc</code>. Some criteria are given in the Unix &amp; Linux question <a href="//unix.stackexchange.com/q/124518"><em>How is bc different from dc?</em></a>, such as “<em>bc is standardised by POSIX and so is probably the more portable of the two</em>.”</p>

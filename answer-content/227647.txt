<p>I would clean it up by separating my declarations from my code. With the below code, it becomes immediately clear to the reader that you are working with the various denominations of US currency. I have to work to figure it out in your code. Also, this lends itself to using other currency. I could define a different denominations variable to work with different currencies without changing my code at all. </p>

    Denomination("Twenties", 20.00),

    Denomination("Fives", 5.00),

    Denomination("Quarters", 0.25),
    Denomination("Dimes", 0.10),

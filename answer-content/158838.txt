<p>I think your code doesn't look straightforward and is a little confusing.
You use <code>int i</code> and then implicitly cast <code>i/2</code> to <code>int</code> to check if it is even.</p>

<p>The casting to double also seems weird, it would look better if it was <code>1.0 / i</code> or <code>1d / i</code>.</p>

<p>Also, you don't need to multiply by 4 every iteration, since multiplication distributes over addition.</p>

<p>My answer yould look like this, trying to make it very simple and readable.</p>

<pre><code>/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Uses the formula 4 * (1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ...) to estimate pi
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
public static double EstimatePi(int iterations)
{
    double series = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; iterations; i++)
    {
        int sign = i.IsEven() ? 1 : -1;
        series += sign / (2d*i + 1);
    }
    return 4 * series;
}

private static bool IsEven(this int number)
{
    return (number % 2 == 0);
}

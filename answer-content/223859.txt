<p>I searched around this forum a bit more and found some advice to use the package <code>cProfile</code>. This helped me locate the problem which was the <code>sum(sum(indicator_normalized))</code> which took more than 95% of the total time for the complete algorithm. I just moved out the sum and the total time for my algorithm went down to 1/19 of the total time it took before.</p>

<p>So the solution was to write this before the maximization step, and then use this variable inside the for loops;</p>

<pre><code>indicator_sum = sum(sum(indicator_normalized))
# Maximization step
</code></pre>

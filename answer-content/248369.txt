<p>There's quite a bit to unpack here. I'm just going to line-by-line it and then show the final version at the end:</p>
<p><code>[DllImport("winmm.dll")] protected static extern int mciSendString(string Cmd, StringBuilder StrReturn, int ReturnLength, IntPtr HwndCallback);</code></p>
<p>Couple things with this one: 1. I don't see why this needs to be <code>protected</code>. Especially in a "main" class like this. 2. The parameter names are not C# idiomatic: capitalization rules and Hungarian notation is not desired.</p>
<p><code>ManagementObjectSearcher searcher = new ManagementObjectSearcher("SELECT MediaLoaded FROM Win32_CDROMDrive");</code></p>
<p>This is an <code>IDisposable</code>-implementing class and it should be wrapped in a <code>using</code> construct.</p>
<p><code>ManagementObjectCollection moc = searcher.Get();</code></p>
<p>This is <em>also</em> an <code>IDisposable</code>-implementing class and should also be wrapped in a <code>using</code> construct.</p>
<p><code>var enumerator = moc.GetEnumerator();</code></p>
<p>Okay, <code>GetEnumerator()</code> and <code>MoveNext()</code> are what as known as <em>mechanism domain</em> (focuses on HOW something gets done) constructs. Most folks never need to be at this level. There are many abstractions that exist that better represent the <em>business domain</em> (focuses on WHAT needs to be done). LINQ is a fantastic way to do this sort of abstraction.</p>
<p><code>if (!enumerator.MoveNext()) throw new Exception("No elements");</code></p>
<p>I do not see any benefit to throwing an exception here. What is the consumer supposed to do with it?</p>
<p><code>bool status = (bool) obj["MediaLoaded"];</code></p>
<p>Naming (along with off-by-one errors and cache invalidation) is one of the hardest problems in computing. If the variable indicates that media is loaded, name it just like the WMI object.</p>
<p><code>MessageBox.Show("The drive is either open or empty", "Optical Drive Status");</code></p>
<p>Don't mix your business logic (determine if the door needs closing, then close) it with UI logic. Same goes for the other <code>MessageBox.Show()</code> call.</p>
<p><code>if (!status) {</code></p>
<p>Minor, but when you have an <code>if</code>..<code>else</code> construct, it's easier to read a positive test versus a negative test.</p>
<p>Ok, let's take these notes and put together a possible enhancement:</p>
<pre><code>     [DllImport("winmm.dll")] private static extern int mciSendString(string command, StringBuilder buffer, int bufferSize, IntPtr callback);

    static void Main(string[] args) {
         if (CloseMedia() {
             MessageBox.Show("The drive is closed and contains an optical media", "Optical Drive Status");
         }
         else {
             MessageBox.Show("The drive is either open or empty", "Optical Drive Status");
         }
    }

    static bool CloseMedia()
    {
        using (ManagementObjectSearcher searcher = new ManagementObjectSearcher("SELECT MediaLoaded FROM Win32_CDROMDrive"))
        using (ManagementObjectCollection moc = searcher.Get())
        {
            var managementObjects = moc.Cast&lt;ManagementObject&gt;();

            if (managementObjects.Any())
            {
                ManagementObject obj = (ManagementObject)managementObjects.First();
                bool mediaLoaded = (bool) obj["MediaLoaded"];

                if (mediaLoaded) {
                    return false;
                }
                else {
                    mciSendString("set cdaudio door closed", null, 0, IntPtr.Zero);
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }

        return false;
    }

<p>This will be a short review because the neural network seems okay.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use <code>numpy</code>. It isn't "cheating" if you want to learn about neural networks, but it will make every computation much faster and help you understand how to use matrices in Python. Numpy is much faster than vanilla Python when it comes to these kind of operations, it's also much easier to write clean code.</p></li>
<li><p>Don't declare everything as <code>global</code>. That's just... bad practice. If you want everything to be in one place, put it in one method (Not that I'd recommend this either), but you need to learn to separate your code without having to globalize everything.</p></li>

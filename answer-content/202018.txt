<p>there are a LOT of problems in the posted code.  Here is one of them:</p>

<pre><code>scanf("%[^\n]", string);
</code></pre>

<p>There is no limit on the number of characters that the user can input.  So the user can cause a buffer overflow, resulting in undefined behavior and possibly an abort of the code.</p>

<p>Suggest using:</p>

<pre><code>scanf("%99[^\n]", string);
</code></pre>

<p>As that limits the total number of characters the user can input to 1 less than the length of the input buffer.  It needs to be 1 less than the length of the input buffer because the <code>%[...]</code> and <code>%s</code> input format specifiers always append a NUL byte to the input</p>

<p>in the header file: <code>ctypes.h</code> are 'functions' tolower(), toupper(), isalpha(), etc etc.  Strongly suggest you make use of them</p>

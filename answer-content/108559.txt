<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>I just had to do something similar today. Take a look at <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/pfxteam/archive/2011/04/02/10149222.aspx" rel="nofollow">this</a>.</p>

<p>If your <code>ICacheItem&lt;TValue&gt;</code> can have value semantics then you can just use the approach above to do something similar to this:</p>

<pre><code>foreach (var p in collection)
{
    if (p.Value.Expired())
    {
        if (!collection.TryRemove(p))
        {
            log.Debug("Did not remove item because it was changed.");
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Indeed in my tests the log message was printed from time to time. Note that the value semantics are important. I overrode Equals for my class.</p>

<h3>Conventions</h3>

<p>If you want similar behavior as ASP.NET Core, you should check against both methods <code>Invoke</code> and <code>InvokeAsync</code>. If not, I would prefer to change the order to seek the methods. Postfix <code>*Async</code> is a convention to return <code>Task</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>View component '...' must have exactly one
  public method named 'InvokeAsync' or 'Invoke'.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Dependencies</h3>

<p>You have included a depedency on a third-party library <code>Autofac</code>. I would try to prevent this. Specially, since there is an easy way of making this class dependency-free. Use a callback <code>Func&lt;..&gt;</code> instead, or an interface <code>ITypeResolver</code> if the func is bad for readability.</p>

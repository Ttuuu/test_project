<p>Some suggestions:</p>

<ol>
<li>I believe <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1319675/96588">the idiomatic way to declare custom exceptions</a> is to inherit from <code>Exception</code> rather than <code>BaseException</code>, and to just use the no-op <code>pass</code> as the class body. I've not seen the <code>__module__ = Exception.__module__</code> pattern before, but if that does what it looks like (making the class effectively part of the exceptions module) that's probably going to be misleading. It's not a generic error, after all.</li>
<li>It <em>might</em> be faster to put both upper and lower case characters in the dict than to use <code>upper()</code>. You could test this with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>timeit</code></a>.</li>
<li>If you're processing a big string of Morse code you might want to use an <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/4586073/96588">iterator</a>. That way the string is processed one word at a time, rather than having to split the entire text into a list in memory before starting to output anything.</li>
<li>Rather than parsing <code>input()</code> I would expect this sort of script to either read standard input or to accept a list of file path <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html" rel="noreferrer">arguments</a> which would each be read and converted.</li>
<li>If the script also accepted <code>--encode</code> and <code>--decode</code> parameters (possibly with <code>--encode</code> as the default) it could easily be used to script a conversion of any text.</li>
</ol>

<p>First of all: nice work! It's easy to read and understand.</p>

<h3>Program organization</h3>

<p>It's very good that you split the task to small functions.
Reading the body of <code>main</code> reveals nicely the overall flow.</p>

<p>Ideas for further improvement:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>place</code> does two things: it reads input from user and updates the state of the board. It would be good to separate these logically distinct steps to different functions. A new function, say <code>read_next_move</code> could return <code>boolean</code> just like <code>place</code>, and take parameters <code>board</code> and <em>pointers</em> to <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, whose values will be used when updating the board state.</p></li>
<li><p>The name <code>check</code> is too generic. How about <code>is_game_over</code> or <code>has_player_won</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Printing the winner would be good to move to a dedicated function, as you did with other steps.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Use more constants</h3>

<p>The special symbols <code>-</code>, <code>x</code> and <code>o</code> would be good to define as constants.
So that instead of <code>if (board[pos] == 'x' || board[pos] == 'o')</code>,
you could write more descriptively <code>if (board[pos] == PLAYER_X || board[pos] == PLAYER_O)</code>, and if ever needed change the values easily.
By the way, in this particular example I would replace the condition with <code>if (board[pos] != AVAILABLE)</code>.</p>

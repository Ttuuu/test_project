<p>You shouldn't have <code>rand</code> and <code>face</code> as class fields. You only use <code>face</code> inside the <code>getFace()</code> method to build the string so it should be a local variable in that method instead. It's the same with <code>rand</code> and the constructor. Additionally you shouldn't create a new <code>Random</code> object every time you need a random number. Instead you should have one single instance of <code>Random</code> for the whole application.</p>

<p>Generating a random card in the card object doesn't seem to be a good idea anyway. This way you'll have duplicate cards and not a regular deck. It would be better to create a complete deck of all 108 cards, shuffle it and draw cards from it.</p>

<p>It's a bad idea to use Strings to represent the colors or numbers to repesent to card functions. This can go wrong if you happen to mistype a color name. Use <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/enum.html" rel="nofollow">Enums</a> instead.</p>

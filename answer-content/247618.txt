<p>First of all, the indentation is weird following the first <code>return false;</code>, as well as some incorrect parentheses, which leads to the code being impossible to compile.</p>
<p>You need to include cmath in order to have access to the <code>sqrt</code> function.</p>
<p>You don't need two <code>++i</code>s in your for loop.</p>
<p>You can group together the case that the number is even (and not a 2) at the end.</p>
<p>Altogether, I came up with this example:</p>
<pre class="lang-cpp prettyprint-override"><code>#include&lt;cmath&gt;
bool is_prime(int num)
{
    if(num == 0 || num == 1)
        return false;
    if(num == 2)
        return true;
    int sq = sqrt(num);

    for(int i = 2; i &lt;= sq; ++i)
        if(num % i == 0)
            return false;

    return true;
}
</code></pre>
<p>And to answer your question, this is not the fastest way. You might want to do some research on</p>

<p>Just answering this question since it is unanswered. Hope, it would help: </p>

<p>Since your code is mainly about RegEx, which you'd most likely know that you can use <a href="https://regex101.com/r/Wdvkfa/4/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> tool:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Your original RegEx based on an exact match method takes 265 steps and 1ms to match your 10 inputs, which is good. </p>

<pre><code>\s*(?:(\s*\d+\s*)|([\[\(]\s*\d+)\s*,\s*(\d+\s*[\]\)]))(?:,\s*(?:(\d+\s*)|\s*([\[\(]\d+)\s*,\s*(\d+\s*[\]\)])|(\s*&gt;\s*=\s*0\s*)))?\s*
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Sometimes, exact match may not be necessary, not sure about your case or if you might have certain boundaries, but maybe you could use a faster RegEx with a lower number of iterations, maybe something similar to <a href="https://regex101.com/r/Wdvkfa/3" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a>, if you are not looking for an exact match, which is pretty fast and might match your 10 inputs with only 50 steps:  </p>

<pre><code>^[0-9\,\[\]\(\) &gt;=]*$
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>The drawback of this method is that it is based on your input characters, i.e., numbers, <kbd>[</kbd>, <kbd>]</kbd>, <kbd>(</kbd>, <kbd>)</kbd>, <kbd>,</kbd>, <kbd>space</kbd> and <kbd>&gt;=</kbd>. </p>

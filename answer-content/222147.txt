<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>You want a list of elements, sorted to descending order by highest perceived value where least valued element is removed if an add operation causes the list size to exceed it's limit.</p>

<pre><code>private final boolean highestIsBest;
</code></pre>

<p>This adds unnecessary responsibilities to the score list. It shouldn't care what the perceived value of a score is. Just pass a <code>Comparator&lt;T&gt;</code> in the constructor (instead of requiring T to implement <code>Comparable</code>) and let the caller worry about reversing the comparator if "smaller is better" order is needed.</p>

<p>Your <code>file[-3:] == ".py"</code> check is later that it should be.  It is part of the check executed for every line of a file, instead of only being done once per file.  You should use:</p>

<pre><code>for file in os.listdir(working_directory):
    if file[-3:] != ".py":
        ...
</code></pre>

<p>Are there other files in the directory?  Maybe a <code>README</code>, <code>Makefile.mak</code> or <code>.gitignore</code>?  Maybe you want to only examine <code>.h</code> files, and/or <code>.hpp</code> files, instead of every file in the directory?</p>

<pre><code>valid_exts = { ".h", ".hpp"}
for file in os.listdir(working_directory):
    if os.path.splitext(file)[1] in valid_exts:
        ...
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Using <code>{line_number + 1}</code> in your format string is not very pretty.  Line numbers start at one, and <code>enumerate()</code> allows you to specify the starting number:</p>

<pre><code>        for line_number, line in enumerate(source_file, 1):
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Why accumulate the results in <code>occurrences</code>, and then write them out afterwords?  Why not write them out as they are found?</p>

<pre><code>with open("logs/log.txt", "w") as log_file:
    for file in os.listdir(working_directory):
        ...
</code></pre>

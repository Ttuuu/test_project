<p>The code as you have it is not able to be executed but once I made some revisions it seems to run just fine. On my test dataset I had no problem with performance, but if you continue to have performance issues after making edits, I would look into something called "Advanced Filter" for Excel, as it has the ability to set a destination at the onset for the filtered data to appear. You can simply look up "Advanced Filter" on your favorite search engine and find links like these, there are hundreds to pick from:</p>

<p>As for my revisions to your code, see below. I've tried to comment every line I changed and change the minimum amount of lines possible.</p>

<p>Overall good job!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does the code looks "modern" (i.e. uses modern conventions etc)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the things I see regularly here on Code Review is the advice to allocate memory based on the size of what an object points to rather than the object type itself:</p>

<pre><code>    *queue = calloc(1, sizeof(*queue));
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>    node_t* node = calloc(1, sizeof(*node));
</code></pre>

<p>This eases maintainability by removing necessary changes, only the type of <code>queue</code> or <code>node</code> needs to be changed in these cases.</p>

<p>While the code is technically correct, I personally would use <code>malloc()</code> in these cases and only use <code>calloc()</code> when creating an array. If the goal is to zero out the memory allocated <code>memset()</code> can be used for that. There won't be any change in performance, <code>calloc()</code> takes longer than <code>malloc()</code> because it does clear the memory. It's not clear that <code>calloc()</code> is necessary for <code>node</code> because all the necessary assignments are performed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is the code efficient in terms of memory usage?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are the tests well thought?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As far as I can tell everything is covered. The test library doesn't seem to provide any information about code coverage and that would be interesting and helpful as well.</p>

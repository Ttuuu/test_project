<p>I'm not sure what your optimizations are doing(comments would be nice), but I did notice several inefficiencies:</p>

<p>Never include a calculation in the limit test in a <code>for</code> loop.  It get's re-calculated on every iteration.  In this case set the limit to <code>sqrt(limit)</code>.  the calculation is kind of expensive but it's done only once.</p>

<p>The same goes for the iteration step, calculate it once before you enter the loop.</p>

<p>In the tests, in the first set of loops, you use <code>3*x*x</code> twice and <code>y*y</code> 3 times.  putting these in variables would be a lot cheaper.</p>

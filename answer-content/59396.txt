<p>Instead of <code>math.pow</code>, use the builtin <code>**</code> operator.  You don't need the <code>\</code>s at EOL, because the parentheses surrounding the expression allow it to implicitly span multiple lines.  So after making both of those changes, I wind up with:</p>

<pre><code>def norm_cdf(z):
    """ Use the norm distribution functions as of Gale-Church (1993) srcfile. """
    # Equation 26.2.17 from Abramowitz and Stegun (1964:p.932)

    t = 1.0 / (1 + 0.2316419*z) # t = 1/(1+pz) , p=0.2316419
    probdist = 1.0 - (   (0.319381530  * t)
                       + (-0.356563782 * t**2)
                       + (1.781477937  * t**3)
                       + (-1.821255978 * t**4)
                       + (1.330274429  * t**5)) * 0.3989423*math.exp(-z*z/2)
    return probdist
</code></pre>

<p>I also rearranged one of the multiplications to make the precedence a bit more obvious and readable.</p>

<p>After those changes, the only issue I still see is all of the magic numbers.  I don't know how those constants are arrived at, but it may help readability if the constants could be given meaningful names.  Sometimes with formulas there isn't really much of a meaningful name to give, though.</p>

<p>Though I don't think there's much to optimize with this code, you could terminate the comparison loop at the end of the shorter of the 2 strings:</p>

<pre><code>int distance = Math.abs(sourceLength-destLength)
for ( int i=0 ;i &lt; Math.min(sourceLength, destLength); i++){
...
</code></pre>

<p>I am assuming here that there are min() and abs() functions in Java (not my language). Of course you would drop the if statement following the loop then.</p>

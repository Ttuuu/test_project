<blockquote>
<pre><code>or rcx, 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an optimization for size, but it does not break the dependency on the old value of <code>rcx</code> (at least not yet, maybe someday, it's not an impossible feature). That's a minor point compared to overall cost of a <code>strlen</code> but it's something to know so you can make the choice deliberately.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>cld
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Should be redundant, typical calling conventions specify that the direction flag is cleared at function call boundaries so your <code>strlen</code> shouldn't be called with it set to backwards. </p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>mov rax, 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
sub rax, rcx
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>mov-ing a 64bit immediate is surprisingly slow, and also a huge instruction. An alternative is:</p>

<pre><code>not rcx
mov rax, rcx
</code></pre>

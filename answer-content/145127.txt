<p>There isn't really any great performance improvement to be made here in my opinion.  You original structure is going to require nested loop approach to generate your desired structure regardless.</p>

<p>My only suggestion would be building an array of objects in your result rather than an array of associative arrays, as I think what you have shown in your example is more meaningful as objects (i.e. items that have a set of properties) vs. as an associative array (which I typically like to use more for hashmap type of use cases).</p>

<p>Seems like the context is really important, so I'm not sure your example is capturing it.  If the critical difference between two variables is the type, and especially if they're both being used around each other, adding the type to the name is fine.  If the issue that the ReallyLongName is obscuring the AsString suffix, I'd probably look for ways to extract the code into a simpler context where the long names aren't necessary.  Like, maybe do the conversion to strings ahead of time and have this method take an <code>IEnumerable&lt;string&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>The check for <code>arr.length &gt; 0</code> is not needed: <code>forEach()</code> can be called
on an empty array (and does nothing in that case).</p>

<p>The check <code>if (arr)</code> protects against a call with an undefined argument,
but not against a call with a non-array. As an example, <code>flatten(123)</code>
would cause a JavaScript error. So you have to decide:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the argument to <code>flatten()</code> is known to be an array then the
outer <code>if</code> statement is not needed at all.</li>
<li>If <code>flatten()</code> can be called with any argument than you need to check
for an array before calling <code>forEach()</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>It looks like you're doing everything in just one component. That's now how you're supposed to be creating Angular Components.</p>

<p>There should be one rule of thumb to keep in mind while creating components. That is, <strong><em>"The purpose of a Component should only be to present data to a user and let the user interact with the data"</em></strong></p>

<p>Keeping this thumb-rule in mind lets us create what are called <strong><em>Skinny Components</em></strong>.</p>

<p>That being said, the only code that should be present in your component should be that of getting the data from a service and then showing it to the user. If there is an operation that needs to be performed on the data, it should be delegated to a service.</p>

<p>Another thing that I saw in the code was, <code>providers: [ StudentsService, TestsService ],</code>. Not sure if you've done this intentionally. But doing this will create a separate instance of these services for <code>TeacherComponent</code> and its children.</p>

<p>One last thing that I'd point out is that there are several things in the <code>TeacherComponent</code> like <code>createCharts</code>, <code>getPercentile</code>, <code>getStats</code> etc. All these should be done as a part of a child component which will then rely on a service to get the appropriate data in the appropriate form.</p>

<p>Hope this helps. Please let me know if you need more comments to get this better, more loosely coupled and with better separation of concerns. It would also help if you could create a StackBliz Project and share it here so that others could look into it.</p>

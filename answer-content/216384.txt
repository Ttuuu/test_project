<h2>Security</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everything is fully encrypted and secure</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, really? I hope that you aren't confusing encoding with encryption. I don't see any encryption taking place.</p>

<p>This is a huge topic, so you have some reading to do - but the bar for 'secure password store' is significantly above where this program currently resides.</p>

<h2>Class syntax</h2>

<p>This:</p>

<pre><code>class user():
</code></pre>

<p>should be</p>

<pre><code>class User:
</code></pre>

<p>Also, you're currently using it as a struct with no methods. That should change - you should move some of your code to be methods on that class.</p>

<h2>Break</h2>

<p>This:</p>

<pre><code>loop = True
while loop:
</code></pre>

<p>should be reworked. You can use a <code>while True</code>, and replace the <code>loop = False</code> with a <code>break</code> at the end of that <code>if</code> block.</p>

<h2>File handles</h2>

<p>Rather than explicitly closing your files, you should usually use them in a <code>with</code> block. Also, this:</p>

<pre><code>user_saves.close
</code></pre>

<p>doesn't do what you think it does; in fact it does nothing. For the function call to occur, you need to add <code>()</code>.</p>

<h2>Redundant <code>else</code></h2>

<p>This:</p>

<pre><code>    return name, password, user
else:
</code></pre>

<p>doesn't need an <code>else</code>, because you've returned in the previous block.</p>

<h2>Write a <code>main</code> method</h2>

<p>...to pull this code out of global scope:</p>

<pre><code>name, password, users = get_user()
data = get_user_data(password)
print(data)
user_stats = user(name, password, data)
</code></pre>

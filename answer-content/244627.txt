<p>The code is too low level and it lacks functionality.</p>
<p>It would be more idiomatic (and probably more efficient depending on circumstances) to use <code>std::getline</code> and extract the whole line from the stream. Then you can just find separators <code>,</code> one by one via <code>find_first_of</code> function of string and separate the line into array of strings.</p>
<p>This method might be lacking when there large rows in the csv file but the whole design of getting vector of strings is an even bigger victim of this case. Consider using a container buffer and vector of string views instead.</p>
<p>Lack of functionality: at times one has knowledge of the format of the csv file and want to perform conversion inplace instead of getting a vector of strings. If you could make a couple methods that satisfy common cases you need to support it would transform your csv library into a usable one.</p>

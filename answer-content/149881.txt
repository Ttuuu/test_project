<p>Per the problem definition, I would expect a function thas is able to check any sequence in an array. Not necessarily <code>(1, 3, 4)</code> which was given as an example. In this case, the sequence should also be a parameter of the function, giving the signature:</p>

<pre><code>def has_sequence(array, sequence):
</code></pre>

<p>Next, I would rely on Python iterations to "check" if <code>array</code> is a list, or at least an iterable. As there is no obvious reasons, to me, that <code>has_sequence('once upon a time', 'e u')</code> should fail. It seems like a valid usecase.</p>

<p>Following, I would use a variation of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools-recipes" rel="noreferrer"><code>itertools</code> recipe</a> <code>pairwise</code> to group elements of <code>array</code> in tuples of the same length than <code>sequence</code>:</p>

<pre><code>import itertools


def lookup(iterable, length):
    tees = itertools.tee(iterable, length)
    for i, t in enumerate(tees):
        for _ in xrange(i):
            next(t, None)
    return itertools.izip(*tees)


def has_sequence(array, sequence):
    # Convert to tuple for easy testing later
    sequence = tuple(sequence)
    return any(group == sequence for group in lookup(array, len(sequence)))
</code></pre>

<p>Now, other things that could have been done better:</p>

<ul>
<li><code># Tested with Python 2.7</code> can be replaced by <code>#!/usr/bin/env python2</code></li>
<li><code>if int_arr[i] == 1 and int_arr[i+1] == 3 and int_arr[i+2] == 4 :</code> can be replaced by <code>if int_arr[i:i+3] == [1, 3, 4]:</code> removing the need for the ugly <code>\</code></li>
<li><code>assert</code> in unit tests should be replaced by <code>self.assertTrue(…)</code> or <code>self.assertFalse(…)</code></li>
<li>you should be more consistent in your usage of whitespace (putting one after each comma, none before any colon…).</li>
</ul>

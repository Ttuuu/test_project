<p>Program looks well structured, so this is gonna be nitpicky</p>
<pre><code>function isDiagonalWinner(id) {
    posGradient = true;
</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>posGradient</code> hasn't been declared anywhere, this will be treated as a global on <code>window['posGradient']</code>. <code>let</code> would suit you nicely here.</p>
<pre><code>var matches = document.querySelectorAll("#board .row .elem .clickable");
</code></pre>
<p>The value of <code>matches</code> never changes. Using <code>const</code> here would indicate this.</p>
<pre><code>var column = 0;
</code></pre>
<p><code>let</code> is a more modern keyword for declaring variables that lives in block scope rather than function scope. For local vaiables in functions, it will likely more often be in line with what you want. Note that it doesn't make a difference here, but can when callbacks are involved.</p>

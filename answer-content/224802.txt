<p>I don't see anything obviously slow, but neither do I see high performance code or multi-threaded compute. It's just straight forward loops.</p>

<p>If you care about performance you should use some math library that uses SSE/AVX/other types of SIMD- instructions to implement data level parallelism. Then you can shard your input data so that you can split the work out over many threads. The number of threads should be CPU threads + 1 in order to maximally exploit instruction level parallelism.</p>

<p>There are many good libraries out there. Personally, I use <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Eigen</a> by default because it performs well, has a syntax that I like and is header only, no need to worry about linking.</p>

<p>In your case, your Channel class can be straight up replaced by the Eigen::VectorXd type that's a specialization of a Nx1 matrix. In general your application seems to translate well to matrix operations and will easily translate to using some linear algebra library.</p>

<p>I'm typing on a phone so I'll stop short of reviewing the code for other aspects as I believe that you should throw most of it away and use a library as noted above.</p>

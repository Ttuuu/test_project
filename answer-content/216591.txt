<li><p>Your classes are setup for <em>inheritance</em>.</p>

<pre><code>class FusionMonster(Monster):
    pass
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>I'd use composition over inheritance. <a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Equip_Card#Monster_Card" rel="noreferrer">This as equip monster cards can go into multiple types</a>. It should be noted that things like <a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Relinquished" rel="noreferrer">Relinquished</a> can make any monster an equipable.</p></li>
<li><p>Your current <code>effect</code> method doesn't care about <a href="https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/gameplay/fasteffects_timing.html" rel="noreferrer">any of the timing rules</a>. This <a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Missing_the_timing" rel="noreferrer">wiki page</a> seems pretty complete on explaining the edge cases. I remember having this happen a couple times, IIRC it was because of my opponent playing an <a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Iron_Chain" rel="noreferrer">Iron Chain</a> deck.</p>

<p>IIRC to do this you'd want to make a 'chain' class that is a stack, you then put all of the effects onto the stack. Once you have built the stack you then run <em>backwards</em> through the chain to to resolve the effects. (I.e. build with <code>Stack.append</code> and resolve with <code>Stack.pop</code>.)</p>

<p>A rudimentary example would be a D.D. deck vs a Frog deck.</p>

<p>Say I use my <a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Dupe_Frog" rel="noreferrer">Dupe frog</a> to attack and kill itself to one of your monsters, to send it to the graveyard to start up my combo. If <a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Dimensional_Fissure" rel="noreferrer">dimensional fissure</a> was a quick spell. After I declare my attack, you could use DF, if that's the end of the chain then DFs effect would activate. Then Dupe frog wouldn't be sent to the graveyard and its timing would be missed.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Infinite_loop" rel="noreferrer">Yugioh has a lot of infinite loops</a>, and so you should design the chain class to take these into affect too.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I think taking these factors into account at <em>the start</em> are very important as it'll force you to implement your code in the correct manner.</p>

<p><code>set</code> in the first solution, and <code>while i in range(n)</code> in the second one are <em>very</em> expensive.</p>

<p>That said, thou shalt not bruteforce.</p>

<p>The crazy guy moves right as long as he visits the odd-populated farms, leaving a trail of even-populated farms behind. As soon as he hits the even-populated farm, he switches direction, and since now on he faces only the even-populated farms, he goes all the way to the Star 1, and the track stops there.</p>

<p>So, find the leftmost even-populated farm. If there is none, the guy would visit all farms, stealing one ship per farm. If there is, its index is the number of farms visited; on the way there, one ship per farm will be stolen, and on the way back another ship per farm will be stolen (except if initially there was just one ship).</p>

<p>This should be enough to keep you going.</p>

<p>As a side note, <code>break</code> in</p>

<pre><code>    if x[i] == 0:
        if i &gt;= farm_visited: farm_visited = i+1
        break
</code></pre>

<p>is a bug. An empty farm should not stop him:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>he steals only one sheep (<strong>if there is any</strong>) from that farm <strong>and moves on</strong></p>

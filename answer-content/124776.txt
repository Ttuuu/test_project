<p>I have a couple of suggestions which are not specifically about the code, but rather about the user experience.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was copy-paste the script to a file, make it executable and tried to run it.</p>

<pre><code>$ chmod +x fetchQ.py
$ ./fetchQ.py 124307 autoproject
./fetchQ.py: line 5: $' Code Review question fetcher.  Given the number of the question, uses\nthe StackExchange API version 2.2 to fetch the markdown of the question and\nwrite it to a local file with the name given as the second argument. ': command not found
... etc ...
</code></pre>

<p>As you understand, I just assumed the script had a shebang line and instead of using <code>python</code>, Bash tried to interpret the script itself. I think other users might have the same expectations and that you should therefore begin your script with the line <code>#!/usr/bin/env python</code>.</p>

<p>Now, you might have noticed, I accidentally left out the <code>.md</code> extension for the file name. Because the primary use-case for this program is to set up a file for AutoProject, which <em>requires</em> files to have that extension, I think it should automatically be added if no other extension is provided.</p>

<p>Finally, the other argument to the program is the question id. Instead of making users extract the id themselves from the url, I think the user should have the option to pass the full link directly because just pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>L</kbd>; <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>C</kbd> is easier than by hand selecting the id portion.</p>

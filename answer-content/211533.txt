<p>Some quick remarks:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Don't use underscores in variable names (<code>page_type</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Why do you call this a "script"? You're returning a list of <code>LI</code>s, i.e. list items.</p></li>
<li><p>On a related note: why a <code>StringBuilder</code>? This is a list of strings that at the end gets returned as a single string. So why then not work with a <code>List&lt;string&gt;</code> and use <code>string.Join()</code> at the end?</p></li>
<li><p>If you find yourself copy-pasting things over and over again and changing only parts of what you copy-pasted, you should stop copy-pasting and instead write a method that takes the necessary arguments and returns the required string. All of your list items are the same, except for the LI's class, the link's class, part of the link's URL and the text that is displayed. Imagine you need to change something in that HTML: if this was the return of a method, you'd only need to change it in one place, not dozens.</p></li>
<li><p>The logic inside <code>page_type == "office"</code> and <code>page_type == "onsite"</code> seems to be identical. Why then have separate blocks? Again: do not copy-paste code.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The algorithm looks correct.</p>

<p>Regarding the function signature, I'd make three changes:</p>

<ol>
<li>You're not modifying elements, so take it by constant reference rather than reference.  </li>
<li>You don't need to specify a pointer to Function, Function is already a template parameter, and non-pointers could be valid (ex: a class with a () operator).   </li>
<li>"callback" isn't a very useful name for this case.  "predicate" would be better.   </li>
</ol>

<p>While this form is fine, I'd also include a version that takes a start/end iterator instead of a container.</p>

<p>Also, there's no reason to include vector or iostream in any.hpp - only include things that are necessary.</p>

<p>For completeness in the testing method, you should also test with an empty collection, and a collection with no matches.</p>

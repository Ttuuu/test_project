<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>I'd like to focus on a different aspect:</p>

<p>I find it dangerous using the same class <code>LoanAccount</code> both as a storage class inside Bank and as a data transfer class in the API, because if by accident the code on the outside gets an storage instance then it could change it's data bypassing the service.</p>

<p>I'd suggest to make <code>LoanAccount</code> an interface containing only getters and use this in the API methods. Then <code>Bank</code> and the caller would have their own implementations that can't be modified by the other side.</p>
    </div>

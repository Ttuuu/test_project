<p>In 'check_win', the logic is missing the 9th move winning player validation.  Your logic will state "A DRAW!" on 9th move without checking 8 'self.win_conditions'.  If one player wins on the last move, it will say "A DRAW!". 
It appears that you are quite talented based on your code.  I believe that you will find the answer easily without me laying out details of fix.  Good job!  I appreciate sharing your work.</p>

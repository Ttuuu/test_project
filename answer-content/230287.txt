<p>Putting aside the matter of optimization for now: I have concerns about the numerical approach here. If this is written with a specific application in mind, and you can make certain assumptions about your data, you might be fine; but if this is to be applied generally there are certain cases that are going to give you a lot of trouble.</p>

<p>I suspect that the data being processed are financial in nature, due to your <code>close_prices</code> variable, in which case the following degenerate case is entirely possible.</p>

<p>What if your data are periodic, and the fundamental spectral component is close to the reciprocal of your window size? In the simplest case, imagine a cosine whose peaks align with the borders of your window. Noise at the borders will generate false peak and valley positives. For this and other reasons, having a fixed window size doesn't lend itself well to accurate analysis.</p>

<p>Numerical statistics is a deep and very complex topic. You'll need to do some reading on this, and will likely find that it's more appropriate for you to apply a library with local minima/maxima search than to roll your own. Read for example this SO answer:</p>

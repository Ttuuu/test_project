<p>Yes.</p>

<p>You can see that your <code>sort</code> function operates by recursing directly on itself, using a shorter-by-one version of its list parameter. This is stopped when the list is of length 0 or 1. (That code should be cleaned up.) So your <code>sort</code> recurses <code>n-1</code> times, given <code>n &gt;= 2</code>.</p>

<p>Each time it recurses, <code>sort</code> calls <code>push_up</code> once. The <code>push_up</code> function linearly scans the list, which is of length 1, then 2, then <code>... n-1</code>.</p>

<p>So in the worst case (input array is reverse-sorted) you have scans of total length \$ \sum 1 ... (n-1) \$, which makes your code \$ O(n^2) \$.</p>

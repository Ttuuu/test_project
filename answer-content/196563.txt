<p>The OP has got the web scraping very close. But there are a couple of things that need to be tweaked.</p>
<h2>WriteToSheet:Sub</h2>
<p>Case in point <code>WriteToSheet</code>.  <code>RetrieveCountries</code> pass a Base 0 array to it and <code>CleanSource</code> passes a Base 1 array.  There seems to be no attempt to adjust for the differences.  It is causing the target ranges for  both <code>and</code> to be 1 row larger then the data array.  This is causing the <code>#N/A</code> in the last row of both the <code>MinorSheet</code> and the <code>MajorSheet</code>.</p>
<p>The cells should also be cleared before the data in added.</p>
<p>Here is an easy fix:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>Set printRange = targetSheet.Range("A2").Resize(UBound(valueArray) - LBound(valueArray) + 1, 2)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This line tells me that the technique for parsing the JSON is incomplete:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>printRange.Replace What:=Chr$(34) &amp; FIND_STRING, Replacement:=vbNullString
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<h2>RetrieveCountries:Function</h2>
<p>Here is another attempt to jerry-rig the code because the parsing isn't quite right.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>countryArray(UBound(countryArray), 2) = Left$(countryArray(UBound(countryArray), 2), Len(countryArray(UBound(countryArray), 2)) - 2)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Adjusting the last element in an array after the value has been assigned to it, feels ... I don't know tacky??</p>
<p>I would probably strinp the ends of the <code>responseText</code> first.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code> responseText = Mid(responseText,4,len(responseText)-6)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>IMO. writing a Function to process the <code>JSON responseText</code> and a Sub to merge arrays would greatly simplify the code.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>Function JSONCodeNameToArray(responseText As String)  as Variant()

Sub MergeJSONArrays(Arr1 as Variant(), Arr2 As Variant())
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that it would be even easier to pass a Dictionary with the <code>responseText</code>.  This would make adding the "Sub Regions" really simple.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>Sub AddJSON(ByRef responseText As String, ByRef Dic As Object)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>Addendum</h2>
<h2>CreateHierarchy:Class</h2>
<p>I am not going to examine this class but instead am going to show an easier way to create the hierarchy using sequel.  To simplify writing the SQL I pasted the worksheets from <code>ebird.xlsm</code> into an Access database.  I then used the query designer to write and test the sql.  The query can also be modify to ran against <code>ebird.xlsm</code>.  You will have to enclose the worksheet names followed by $ in brackets(e.g [SubNat2Sheet$] .</p>
<pre><code>SELECT countrySheet.[Country Code], countrySheet.Country, SubNat1Sheet.[Region Code], SubNat1Sheet.[Region Name]
FROM countrySheet INNER JOIN SubNat1Sheet ON countrySheet.[Country Code] = Left(SubNat1Sheet.[Region Code],2)
UNION ALL
SELECT countrySheet.[Country Code], countrySheet.Country, SubNat2Sheet.[Region Code], SubNat2Sheet.[Region Name]
FROM countrySheet INNER JOIN SubNat2Sheet ON countrySheet.[Country Code] = Left(SubNat2Sheet.[Region Code],2)
</code></pre>

<p>Personally I think the default no-arg constructor is very unnecessary if these are immutable classes. Does a Rectangle by default having width 1 and height 1 make much sense?</p>

<p>And also, if the classes are immutable, you might as well calculate the areas and perimeters right away, so they can be just returned in the appropriate methods.</p>

<p>I also think the naming of methods could be better. Instead of <code>area()</code> I would use <code>getArea()</code>.</p>

<p>The modified Rectangle would look like the following (note that the Shape class would also need to be edited):</p>

<pre><code>public class Rectangle extends Shape {
  private final double width, height, area, perimeter;

  public Rectangle(double width, double height) {
    this.width = width;
    this.height= height;
    this.area = width * height;
    this.perimeter = 2 * (width + height);
  }

  @Override
  public double getArea() {
    return this.area;
  }

  @Override
  public double getPerimeter() {
    return this.perimeter;
  }

}
</code></pre>

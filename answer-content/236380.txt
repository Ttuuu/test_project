<p>You can get rid of the <code>goto</code> in <code>operator*=</code> by adding an <code>else</code> to the <code>if (val == -1)</code> statement.</p>

<p>The <code>%</code> operator cannot underflow, as the result always has a magnitude less than the rhs value.  So you don't need your underflow check (which is incorrect anyways, as it would throw rather than return a 0).</p>

<p>An "underflow" represents a number that is too small to represent, and is typically applied to floating point types.  A calculation that gives a number that is negative and too large to store in the result (i.e., is less than <code>min</code>) is still an overflow, as the result has overflowed the storage space available.  So all those places that you throw an <code>underflow_error</code> should be <code>overflow_error</code> (unless you're changing the usage of underflow to represent too large of a negative value).</p>

<p>How does the code behave if I instantiate a <code>safe_int&lt;unsigned&gt;</code>?  The evaluation of <code>-max</code> in that case will not give the correct result, and possibly cause a compiler warning (for negation of an unsigned value).</p>

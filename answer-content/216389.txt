<p>You are using <code>long long</code> for your products.  The maximum possible product of 4 numbers between 0 &amp; 100 is <span class="math-container">\$100^4\$</span>, which fits in 27 bits.  Using a <code>long</code> would be sufficient, as well as probably faster.</p>

<p>When traversing rows, columns, right diagonals and left diagonals, your <code>oneDIndex()</code> increases by 1, 20, 21, and 19, respectively.  The structure of your product_line maximum search is roughly the same in all 4 cases.  You could combine these functions into one general purpose utility function to handle all of the 4 cases, with appropriate parametrization of the starting points, stopping points and strides.</p>

<p>(Since this is a programming challenge, I will leave the realization of the above algorithm to the reader.)</p>

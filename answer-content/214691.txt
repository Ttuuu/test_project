<ul>
<li><p>Instead of reading from a compiled-in filename, allow the user to specify the file to read (e.g. as a command argument).  Even better, just accept input on <code>std::cin</code>; that gives much greater flexibility (e.g. will allow us to filter or combine sets of scores to pass to our program in a pipeline).</p></li>
<li><p>Be careful with <code>TotalScore</code>, which is an <code>int</code>, and so could overflow when accumulating relatively few results (e.g. on platforms where <code>int</code> is 16 bits, at just 328 top marks as input).  Using <code>unsigned int</code> will double that range; a longer type (such as <code>std::uint32_t</code>) will allow you to accumulate millions of results.  For really large input sets, you'll want to keep an incremental mean rather than adding all the inputs - see <a href="http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/fanf2/hermes/doc/antiforgery/stats.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Incremental calculation of weighted mean and variance</a> by Tony Finch for a good introduction to the method.</p></li>

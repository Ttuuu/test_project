<p>That looks buggy to me. The spec says (my emphasis)</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>that reads <strong>an ASCII text file</strong> and identifies all the English alphabet (A-Z, a-z) super freqs <strong>in that text file</strong></p>
  </blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Three examples (A, B and C) of the <strong>possible content of this file</strong> are shown below:</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn't say anything about the text file being 1 line long, or having different test cases on different lines.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>        s = re.sub(r"[^a-z]+", '', line.lower())
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Why <code>line.lower()</code>? It seems to make more sense to convert it to upper case since that's what you use later for output.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>        d, c = Counter(s), 0
        for e in d:
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>These are not descriptive names.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>            if d[e] / len(line) &gt; 0.15:
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Why use floating point numbers and introduce potential bugs with rounding? Some elementary arithmetic manipulation would give a calculation which is entirely in integers.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>        if (c == 0):
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The brackets are unconventional in Python.</p>

<p>This thing will work as long as one doesn't <code>push_back</code> beyond the capacity.</p>

<p>I wouldn't call it <code>AtomicFixedSizedVector</code> - I think it's better to name it <code>AtomicFixedCapacityBackInserter</code> or something and let it wrap an iterator of the vector - or pointer towards base of the vector - plus the very same atomic size. That's because this way its name states more clearly and precisely what it does and aims to do.</p>

<p><code>std::vector::reserve</code> is ought to make the allocation and you can access the size of the total allocated amount via <code>capacity</code> function.</p>

<p>However, you should be aware that this is just a safety mechanism and unlikely to be an optimization. It might and probably will perform slower than a single threaded insertion. That's due to cacheline size and mechanism of syncronization of the said cachelines. The efficiency or lackthereof is surely hardware dependant and requires testing.</p>

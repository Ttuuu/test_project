<p>First off, for a beginner, this code is actually quite good! I do have some suggestions for improvement though, specifically regarding documentation and such.</p>

<ul>
<li>First off, you did great with <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="noreferrer">PEP8</a>. The only errors I'm getting back are that there are too many lines greater than 79 characters long. You do have an unnecessary semicolon on line <code>233</code> though.</li>
<li>You have a lot of code in your <code>game_loop</code> function. I would recommend separating this function into smaller functions, each with their own individual purpose. This will help improve readability as well.</li>
<li>You're missing documentation in your code. The only comments that I see are useless ones like <code># DOWN BOMBS</code>, or <code># Event handling</code>. Comments should be descriptive, and describe a block of code well. For functions, you should use docstrings to describe what they do. Here's an example.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<pre><code>def my_function(args):
    """
    Flesh this docstring out with useful
    information about the function.
    """
    # Code goes here
</code></pre>

<hr>

<ul>
<li>Another thing that really sticks out here is your naming. The variables you have at the top of the file are mostly all constants. If you have a constant variable (value doesn't change), it's name should be in all uppercase. For example, if a variable has the name <code>BLOCK_SIZE</code>, we can tell that it's a constant describing the block size.</li>
<li>With the issue of naming continued, a few of your variable names are a little hard to understand, for example, from looking at the function argument <code>b_x</code>, I don't know what it does. If it's an abbreviation of something, and it's this short, don't abbreviate it.</li>
<li>My final tip is to format lists, dictionaries, and tuples like the below example. Not in the current form you're doing it. It mostly just improves readability.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<pre><code>my_list = [
    an_item
    ...
]
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>In short, your code is pretty good! I hope that this answer helped you improve your code!</p>

<p>It's good to have single method to control flow as you have in <code>B</code>, but this method should be mostly calling other methods of your class (you also call there <code>checkQuantity</code> for example, which is also in <code>A</code>). That way <code>add</code> is still very flexible - you can override those methods (probably protected methods, not public), that it calls or as last resort override that method itself.</p>

<p>If you think <code>B</code> is more readable, imagine, there would be something like <code>this-&gt;addToCart</code> instead of this bit (and that extracted to separate method):</p>

<pre><code>   $product_id = $this-&gt;request-&gt;post-&gt;product_id;
    $cart = $this-&gt;getCart();
    $product = $shop-&gt;getProduct($product_id);

    $cart-&gt;items-&gt;add($product);
    $added = $cart-&gt;save();
</code></pre>

<p>I'd google for "single responsibility principle".</p>

<p>In addition to answer by Barry, I would like to state that your code has nice structure, good comments and reads easily. There are however a few minor points I would make:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Join the imports from the same module</em> – In general you shouldn't join <em>multiple <code>import</code>s</em> at the same line, but when getting things from the same module the recommendation is to join it like in: <code>from api_keys import CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, CATEGORY_ID</code></p></li>
<li><p><em>Extract the url pattern into a constant</em> – Most of the search url is constant, and could be moved to the top. Building the url has then a cleaner better focus on the changing parts:</p>

<pre><code>url = SEARCH_URL.format(lat, lng, distance,
                        CATEGORY_ID, CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET,
                        time.strftime("%Y%m%d"))
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
    </div>

<p>Given your example, I don't see much advantage of using <code>enums</code>. I'd keep it simple and do </p>

<p><code>weekday_color = {"Monday": "RED", "Tuesday": "GREEN", ...}</code></p>

<p>Now, if you want to keep going down the enum route, you can make them more useful. For example the <code>Color</code> enum, instead of having the strings as values, you can pack information like the code the color has</p>

<pre><code>class Color(Enum):
    RED = 'FF0000'
    GREEN = '00FF00'
    BLUE = '0000FF'
</code></pre>

<p>Then you reduce duplication and pack more information that could be useful later on.</p>

<p>Concerning the <code>Weekday</code> enum, I'd change it as follows</p>

<pre><code>from enum import IntEnum, auto

class Weekday(IntEnum):
    MONDAY = auto()
    TUESDAY = auto()
    WEDNESDAY = auto()
    THURSDAY = auto()
    FRIDAY = auto()
</code></pre>

<p>With this, you get comparison/sorting of the weekdays in a way that feels natural. And by using <code>auto()</code> you don't retype the name of the weekday as value. Although you lose the possibility of doing something like <code>Weekday("Monday")</code>, but then you access it like `Weekday["MONDAY"] to access by name.</p>

<p>Thus</p>

<pre><code>from enum import Enum, IntEnum, auto


class Weekday(IntEnum):
    MONDAY = auto()
    TUESDAY = auto()
    WEDNESDAY = auto()
    THURSDAY = auto()
    FRIDAY = auto()


class Color(Enum):
    RED = 'FF0000'
    GREEN = '00FF00'
    BLUE = '0000FF'


weekday_color = {
    Weekday.MONDAY: Color.RED,
    Weekday.TUESDAY: Color.GREEN,
    Weekday.WEDNESDAY: Color.BLUE,
    Weekday.THURSDAY: Color.GREEN,
    Weekday.FRIDAY: Color.RED,
}


def main():
    today_input = 'Monday'
    today = Weekday[today_input.upper()]  # adding uppercasing to be resilient
    today_color = weekday_color[today]
    print(f"{today.name}'s color is {today_color.name} with code {today_color.value}") 


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()  # output: MONDAY's color is RED with code FF0000
</code></pre>
    </div>

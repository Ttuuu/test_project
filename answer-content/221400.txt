<p>okay... 
just have some advice for you
First of all - read PEP8 (<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/</a>)
It's a really important document for writing clear code in Python
Try to make a clear structure of your code - check all imports and def's
You do not really need to import all module for using only one function of it - like pandas
Also, check all spaces and brackets in your code
So, you better should not use "magic strings" - try to use some variables for filename and columns in it, and then you will be able to move them away from code
And use a construction like
    if <strong>name</strong> == "<strong>main</strong>": </p>

<p>try to refactor your code and then someone will help you with review</p>

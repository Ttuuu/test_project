<h2>Use standard docstrings</h2>

<p>This comment:</p>

<pre><code>to get input from user
</code></pre>

<p>is best placed in a docstring:</p>

<pre><code>def get_input():
    """
    get input from user
    """
</code></pre>

<h2>Consider using type hints</h2>

<p>You're best to google this, because there's a wealth of information about it, but as an example: the <code>idx</code> argument would be <code>idx: int</code>.</p>

<h2>Operator precedence</h2>

<pre><code>(2 * idx) + 1
</code></pre>

<p>doesn't need parens, because multiplication has stronger association than addition.</p>

<h2>Never <code>except:</code></h2>

<p>At the least, you should write <code>except Exception</code> instead of <code>except</code>. The latter can prevent user break (Ctrl+C) from working. If possible, replace Exception with something more specific.</p>

<h2>Use a comprehension</h2>

<p><code>map</code> is a little difficult to read. Instead, how about</p>

<pre><code>lst = [int(e) for e in input_str.split()]
</code></pre>

<h2>Variable naming</h2>

<p><code>lst</code> isn't helpful - rather than naming things based on what type they are, you should be naming them based on what they actually mean to the program - in this case, perhaps "elements".</p>

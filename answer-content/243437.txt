<p>You have at least one bug.</p>

<hr>

<p>The closure from your code:</p>

<pre><code>package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    for i := 0; i &lt; 7; i++ {
        go func() {
            x := i
            fmt.Printf("Sending successful. i=%v\n", x)
        }()
    }
    time.Sleep(4 * time.Second)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>$ go run closure.go
Sending successful. i=7
Sending successful. i=7
Sending successful. i=7
Sending successful. i=7
Sending successful. i=7
Sending successful. i=7
Sending successful. i=7
$
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>x := i</code> statement is in the wrong place. It should be:</p>

<pre><code>package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    for i := 0; i &lt; 7; i++ {
        x := i
        go func() {
            fmt.Printf("Sending successful. i=%v\n", x)
        }()
    }
    time.Sleep(4 * time.Second)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>$ go run closure.go
Sending successful. i=4
Sending successful. i=5
Sending successful. i=1
Sending successful. i=3
Sending successful. i=2
Sending successful. i=0
Sending successful. i=6
$
</code></pre>

<p>Not a code review per se, however there were two behaviors worth commenting on when I ran your snippet.</p>

<p>A few seconds after initiating gameplay a second apple appeared without my having collected the first apple, leaving 2 apples permanently on the screen.</p>

<p>Your code currently allows the snake to about face. This is not typical for snake games. Especially since doing so after eating the first apple (and thus having a size of 2+) is suicide. You should disable 180 degree reversals.</p>

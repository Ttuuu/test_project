<p>What is the purpose of this simple smart pointer class? It seems meaningless and hiding terrible mistakes.
The use of it could be very dangerous. Simple example:</p>

<pre><code>void f()
{
  my_pointer p1{ new int }
  //some code
  my_pointer p2 = p1;
  //some code
}
</code></pre>

<p>If we call f() the result will be terrible. The memory allocated for int is freed twice.</p>

<p>There is no need to assign data nullptr because the object is not meant to be used after call of destructor.</p>

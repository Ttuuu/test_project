<p>Thanks for reminding me about Dilbert comics. I had somehow forgotten about them and it's nice to see new comics are still being written.</p>

<p>I'm not a python guy, so hopefully you receive other responses but here are a few minor suggestions:</p>

<p>Use <code>NEWEST_COMIC</code> instead of <code>date.today()</code> on line 240:</p>

<pre><code>elif start_date &gt; date.today():
</code></pre>

<p>You've defined a method for <code>get_today</code> but also use <code>date.today()</code></p>

<p>Don't shorten parameter names. Instead of a comment describing them, use the full length name</p>

<pre><code>def download_dilbert(s, u):
def download_engine(fcsd, lcsd): #fcsd = first comic strip date &amp; lcsd = last comis strip date
</code></pre>

<p>You could implement some limiting functions to prevent spamming the Dilbert web page. "GoComics.com" hosts older Dilbert Comics in case you need to make lots of requests.</p>

<p>Saving the images locally might be breaking some rules/laws, but you could keep a list of URL's (E.g <a href="https://assets.amuniversal.com/264ee6a0674001301b57001dd8b71c47" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://assets.amuniversal.com/264ee6a0674001301b57001dd8b71c47</a>) with the date/name of the comic so you're not re-loading an entire page to get a previously loaded Image.</p>

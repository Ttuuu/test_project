<p>If we continue with the idea that this is a doubly linked list rather than a vector, I'd say your <code>push_back</code> and <code>pop_back</code> are a good start. Your Struct is also perfect for the groundwork of a doubly linked list.</p>

<p>However, on that note, you're missing a few operations for this data structure to be considered a proper doubly linked list.</p>

<p>A doubly linked list should provide these operations (to the best of my memory):</p>

<ul>
<li>Insert (front/back/after index)</li>
<li>Delete (front/back/at index)</li>
<li>Traverse</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently you've only implemented insert and delete from the back. As for traversal, I could see <code>display</code> being a traversal in a sense, but I'd argue that displaying is not an operation strictly inherent to data structures. I would also like to point out that your current implementation of display would not allow you to traverse and display the list more than once.</p>

<p>Overall though, I'd like to point out again that you have a very strong start. It's easy enough to provide alternative <code>push_front</code>, <code>push_after</code>, <code>pop_front</code>, and <code>pop</code> functions from what you have; and I'd recommend changing <code>display</code> to some sort of traversal method instead (maybe an iterator pattern) and move the displaying to your main function all together.</p>

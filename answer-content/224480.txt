<p>You probably want to </p>

<ul>
<li>add a constant for speed 0</li>
<li>create a test for MaxSpeed</li>
<li>create a test case for 64 (it's one edge of the <em>partition class</em>  <code>0 &lt;= x &lt; speedlimit</code> and it could replace 60 which is in the same partition class)</li>
</ul>

<p>I would keep the 66 test case since it is and edge case.</p>

<p>Even though the edges are cut pretty clear with ints (compared to using float values) you might still want to test them explicitly.</p>

<p>Overall, looks very good and clean to me too, especially from a first poster. A few minor things:</p>

<p>PEP 8 prefers triple double quotes for docstrings. I don't particularly care but it's in the contract to point such things out. And, in general, it's a courtesy to reviewers to get your IDE/linter to fix such things before posting. </p>

<p>There are a few debateable comparisons to 0. I'm not sure that I greatly prefer "if expected_no_of_ops" to "if expected_no_of_ops &gt; 0". However, "if not line" is definitely more idiomatic than "if len(line) == 0:"</p>

<p>Finally, I marginally prefer passing a stream rather than a string to Assembler:</p>

<pre><code> ass = Assembler(f.read()) 
 ... 
 for num, line in enumerate(self.code.split("\n"), 1):
</code></pre>

<p>would be easier as:</p>

<pre><code> ass = Assembler(f) 
 ... 
 for num, line in enumerate(self.code_stream, 1):
</code></pre>

<p>You can always use StringIO to go from string to stream (e.g. for testing)</p>

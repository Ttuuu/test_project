<p>One thing that you should avoid, if possible, is the use of raw pointers, from my point of view you should convert them on shared pointers by default and once your software evolves check if you need a more specific type, such as a unique pointer. On the other hand, if you can not avoid the use of a raw pointer is fine if you have tests that cover that, but as a good practise I would recommend to use shared/unique pointers by default to avoid memory issues and try to stay away of raw pointers as much as you can.</p>

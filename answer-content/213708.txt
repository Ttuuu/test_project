<p>I could be wrong, but looking at <code>Integer</code> I think it is really <code>NaturalNumber</code>. It doesn't seem to support negative numbers.</p>

<p>There are a <em>lot</em> of reversals going on. It would almost certainly make more sense to use the reversed (little-endian) number internally, and only actually call <code>std::reverse</code> when converting between strings and <code>Integer</code>s.</p>

<p><code>padLeft</code> and <code>stripLeadingZeros</code> do not belong in the public API of the class (and I'm not even sure they should be required in the private API). An <code>Integer</code> should be an integer, not a string. <code>padRight</code> would be more appropriately named something like <code>multiplyByPowerOfTen</code> or <code>shiftLeftDecimal</code>.</p>

<p>If the Karatsuba multiplication is intended to be practical rather than purely an academic exercise, the base case should be when the multiplication can be done in a native type: probably when both numbers are less than 10 ** 9, so they fit in a (signed) 32-bit type and the result in a (signed) 64-bit type.</p>

<p>You can use loops to reduce repetition between players, here is an example:</p>

<pre><code>P1_Ships = [['Carrier', 1], ['Battleship', 1], ['Cruiser', 1], ['Submarine', 1], ['Destroyer', 1]] #number of ships to place
P2_Ships = [['Carrier', 1], ['Battleship', 1], ['Cruiser', 1], ['Submarine', 1], ['Destroyer', 1]]

for x in P1_Ships: #place ships
    r = 0

    while x[1] &gt; 0: #check there's ships available
        r += 1
        type = x[0]
        ship_size = Ships[x[0]]
        position = input("Player 1, enter start position of {0}: ".format(x[0])) #choose position (i.e, A1)
        check = place_ship(game_board, ship_size, position, type)
        if check is True:
            x[1] -= 1
        else:
            print("Can't place ship here.")

for z in P2_Ships: #place ships
    r = 0

    while z[1] &gt; 0: #check there's ships available
        r += 1
        type = z[0]
        ship_size = Ships[z[0]]
        position = input("Player 2, enter start position of {0}: ".format(z[0])) #choose position (i.e, A1)
        check = place_ship(opponent_board, ship_size, position, type)
        if check is True:
            z[1] -= 1
        else:
            print("Can't place ship here.")

<p>Becomes:</p>

<pre><code>for player, board, ships in ( ("1", game_board, p1_ships), ("2", opponent_board, p2_ships) ):
    # Exercise for the reader
</code></pre>

<p>(Please note that the ships are the same for each player so you can just set one equal to the copy of the other.)</p>

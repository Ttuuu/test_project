<p>V nice code. Plus points for</p>

<ul>
<li>not doing <code>using namespace std</code></li>
<li>using standard containers</li>
</ul>

<p>Comments</p>

<p>Be consistent with naming things, members of Pokemon class <code>type</code>, <code>Gender</code>.</p>

<p>I would strongly suggest using a special naming convention for member variables. Some dont like this , but I do. so use m_gender or gender_, this makes code clearer in functions, you know what data you are manipulating</p>

<p>I dont think you should have a default constructor. Its meaningless and not needed</p>

<p>Break the code up into functional chunks, LoadPokemons, PrintPoke, PromptUser, ....</p>

<p>Use map not vector. This allows direct lookup rather than linear searching</p>

<p>Notice that you repeat the code for string upper-&gt; lower and vice versa. Make  functions to do this.</p>

<p>Future idea. Load the pokemon data from a file rather than compiling into the program.</p>

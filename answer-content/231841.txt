<p>The biggest problem in the design is lack of option for casting and the smart pointer cannot hold properly an interface class. To fix it you need a redesign.</p>

<p><code>std::shared_ptr</code> deals with it by storing control block separately. It is a control block and not just reference counter, it stores pointer to deleter and has two reference counters for <code>std::weak_ptr</code> support.</p>

<p>Just a few days ago I posted on code review another lightweight version of <code>std::shared_ptr</code>... it has a few issues currently which I'll fix and make another post by the end of the week. You can change it to single-threaded version by simply changing the type of reference counter.</p>

<p>This looks great! The only things I can think of are the following: </p>

<p>Validation:</p>

<p>Your validation interface is called <code>IValidator</code>, but the instance is called _validate. Both make sense in their own context, but seeing <code>IValidator _validate</code> just doesn't seem right. Maybe rename the instance to _validator, or the interface to IValidationAction or IValidationRule?</p>

<p>Access modifiers:</p>

<p>It is hard to say without having a view on your project/solution structure, but do all methods need to be public?</p>
    </div>

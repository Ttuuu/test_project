<ul>
<li><p>Naming</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>word_count</code> is a wrong name. The function doesn't <em>count words</em>. It conts them sorts them and prints them - in other words, it completes the assignment. Hence a right name would be <code>exercise_NNN</code> with a proper number.</p></li>
<li><p><code>_file</code> looks strange. <code>filename</code> seems better because the argument <em>is</em> a file name.</p></li>
<li><p><code>process_dict</code> is non-descriptive. The function converts the dictionary into a sorted list. Should be <code>to_sorted_list</code> or something along the same line.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The final sort order is decided by a printing routine. I seriously doubt this design. A sorter should sort, a printer should print. For instance, your solution may be penalized by sorting data twice.</p></li>
<li><p>Context managers are much more pythonic than raw open/close methods:</p>

<pre><code>with open(_file, "rU") as src:
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>In any case, <code>open</code> (and reading a file) may throw an exception. Better catch them. Graceful exit is a valuable feature.</p></li>
</ul>

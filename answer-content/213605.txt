<h3>Keep it simple</h3>

<p>This condition is used to decide whether an extra digit is needed:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>if(a[0]==0)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Why does this work? This works because the only way the first digit is 0,
if the digit before that was 9 and there was a carry,
which is only possible if the digit before that was 9 and there was a carry,
and so on.</p>

<p>This is a lot to keep in the head.
There is a much simpler way:
declare <code>int carry</code> before the loop,
and update it within the loop.
The code will look more like this:</p>

<pre><code>int carry = 0;

while (...) {
    // ...
}

if (carry == 1) {
</code></pre>

<p>Isn't that a lot simpler to understand and reason about?</p>

<h3>Pay attention to style</h3>

<p>The computer doesn't care about the writing style, but humans do.</p>

<p>Instead of this:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>while(length&gt;=0)
{
    a[length]=a[length]+1;
    int carry = a[length]/10;
    if(carry==1)
    {
        a[length]=0;
        length=length-1;
    }
    else
        break;
}

if(a[0]==0)
{
    int [] array = new int[a.length+1];
    array[0]=1;
    for(int i=1;i&lt;array.length-1;i++)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The preferred writing style in Java is like this:</p>

<pre><code>while (length &gt;= 0) {
    a[length]++;
    int carry = a[length] / 10;
    if (carry == 1) {
        a[length] = 0;
        length--;
    } else {
        break;
    }
}

if (a[0] == 0) {
    int[] array = new int[a.length + 1];
    array[0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i &lt; array.length - 1; i++) {
</code></pre>

<p>I suggest to follow the above pattern.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>CheckVictory</code>: Idiomatic in Python is <code>check_victory</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>CheckVictory(board, x, y)</code>: I think you are mixing two things here, putting a value in the board and checking if someone won. Your function should be doing only one thing, checking if someone won on a given <code>board</code>. </p></li>
<li><p>A standard approach is to prepare all the data you need (here, the positions/coordinates to check) and leave the code as simple as possible. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I'd write:</p>

<pre><code>positions_groups = (
    [[(x, y) for y in range(3)] for x in range(3)] + # horizontals
    [[(x, y) for x in range(3)] for y in range(3)] + # verticals
    [[(d, d) for d in range(3)]] + # diagonal from top-left to bottom-right
    [[(2-d, d) for d in range(3)]] # diagonal from top-right to bottom-left
)

def get_winner(board):
    """Return winner piece in board (None if no winner)."""
    for positions in positions_groups:
        values = [board[x][y] for (x, y) in positions]
        if len(set(values)) == 1 and values[0]:
            return values[0]

board = [
    ["X", "X", "O"],
    ["O", "X", "X"],
    ["O", "X", "O"],

print(get_winner(board)) # "X"

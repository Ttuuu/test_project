<p>Why is <code>read7</code> declared <code>inline</code>? You should only do this when it's needed as an optimization. (And it's particularly confusing when the function contains a <code>static</code> variable.)</p>

<p>It's not necessary for <code>is</code> to be static. It should really be an argument to <code>read7</code>, so it can work on any <code>istream</code>. (In real code, <code>buffer</code> should also be a parameter to <code>readN</code>, but for this toy problem it's reasonable to have it static.)</p>

<p>Bug: what happens if the input contains null characters?</p>

<p>You could avoid the queue by using a string as the queue. You can simply append the result of each <code>read7</code> to it until you have enough characters, then remove and return the first <code>n</code>.</p>

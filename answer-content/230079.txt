<p>Hint:</p>

<p><span class="math-container">$$
\sum_{i=1}^ni = \frac{n (n+1)}{2}
$$</span></p>

<p>With this you can compute the sum of <code>1</code> to <code>n</code> without looping. Can you figure out a way to do this for all digits with increments of 3? And 5?</p>

<p>The last thing to consider is that with this method, you are counting all digits divisible by 15 double, since they are both divisible by 3 and 5.</p>

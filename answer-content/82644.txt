<li><p>The formula is elegant, and the approach is correct.</p></li>
<li><p>You have to be careful with complexities though. Specifically you have to be very clear about what \$n\$ is. Typically complexity is a function of the <em>size of input</em> (which is, provided that \$n\$ is a matrix dimension, \$n^2\$ itself), so I'd qualify your solution as linear. And since each element should be accounted for, no better solution is possible.</p></li>
<li><p>The asymptotic constant could be better. The problem doesn't ask to rotate the matrix; it is only asks to print the matrix as if it was rotated. In other words, building <code>output</code> is technically a waste of time. Use your formula to print elements as you enumerate them.</p></li>

<p>Firstly, I would like to congratulate you on having quite clear and readable code. That said, there is one main inefficiency that will make this rather unsuitable for large files. The following block</p>

<pre><code>textfile = open(textfile)
text = textfile.read().lower()
textfile.close()
</code></pre>

<p>has the problem that it reads the entire file into memory. This will make the program very slow for large files. The way to fix this is to read bit by bit, and add to the counter incrementally.</p>

<pre><code>def find_most_common_words(textfile, top=10):    
    ''' Returns the most common words in the textfile.'''
    words = collections.Counter()
    with open(textfile) as textfile:
         for line in textfile:
              #how often each word appears
              words.update(line.lower().split())

    return dict(words.most_common(top))
</code></pre>

<p>You should also probably put the last two lines outside the function in an <code>if __name__ == '__main__'</code> so other files can use your most common words piece.</p>

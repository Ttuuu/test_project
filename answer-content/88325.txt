<p>The above looks to be more work than is necessary. Assuming that we are working with all lower case chars, the following should work.</p>

<p>We match the chars at each end, moving inwards on each cycle. Normally, if any do not match, we consider it a fail and break out. If we are allowed a one pair mismatch (i.e. change one character), then we need to keep track of the count of mismatches and if we have 0 or 1 (less than 2) we consider it to be a palindrome.</p>

    int diffCount = 0;
    int left = 0;
    int right = str.length() -1;

    while(right&gt;left){
        if (str.charAt(right--)!= str.charAt(left++)){
            diffCount++;
        }
    }
    return diffCount &lt;2;
}

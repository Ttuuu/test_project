<p>The biggest problem is that there is very little abstraction going on here.  There are plenty of places where a helper function would come in handy, but isn't used, and an object or abstract data type would be good for the individual rods or the set of rods as a whole.  We can't get the big picture of what's going on if we're worried about what this boolean or that pointer are doing, instead of where this disk on that rod is going to go.  </p>

<p>I should be able to at least mostly read the hanoi() function with only an understanding of the towers of hanoi problem; I should not need any idea how you implemented the details of the rods or disks.  When I tried to read it, I saw a for loop that contained a while loop that contained an if statement that contained a while loop that contained an if statement, and I had no idea what was going on.  If it had been a for loop that contained a while loop that had instructions on which disks to put on which rods, it probably would have been easy to read.  </p>

<p>Names could also use some work.  <code>temp</code> and <code>temp2</code> should probably be <code>source_rod</code> and <code>target_rod</code>, if I haven't misunderstood their purpose.  <code>unshift</code> should probably be <code>push</code>.  I don't know what <code>div</code> should be.  It does get used with the mod operator, but that isn't what it is, just how it's used.  <code>flag</code> is a flag, but I don't know what it means.  It might mean that a move has been made.  Name flags after what the flag would mean if it were true.  If <code>flag == true</code> means the universe is going to blow up, don't name it <code>flag</code>, name it something like <code>universe_is_doomed</code>.  </p>

<p>If I've guessed correctly about what everything is doing, then this bit of code:</p>

<pre><code> int t = temp-&gt;disks[0];
 pop(&amp;temp-&gt;disks);
 unshift(t, &amp;temp2-&gt;disks);
 flag = 1;
</code></pre>

<p>should be more like this:</p>

<pre><code> int disk = pop(&amp;source_rod);
 push(disk, &amp;target_rod);
 moved = 1;
</code></pre>

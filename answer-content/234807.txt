<li>Don't use a second instance of the class just to store variables.  Further, don't even use member variables for things local to a function.</li>
<li>In this case, caching would be making one, probably private, method to read the directory listing and populate internal variables with the data.  This would allow all four current methods to just ensure the data has been loaded, and then return things from the internal variables.  This allows you, for instance, to fetch the number of files and know that when you fetch the list of files, you will get the same number.  This may entail adding a <code>reload()</code> method so that you can take a fresh look.</li>
<li>Your <code>readdir()</code> function may return the file type.  If it does, use it.  This turns an O(n*n) operation into an O(n) operation.  (If you don't follow that, try using a directory with 100,000 files in it.)</li>
<li>It is probably unwise to assume that "." and ".." will be the first two entries in a directory.</li>
<li><code>if(s.st_mode &amp; S_IFDIR)</code> is a mistake.  The correct usage is: <code>if((s.st_mode &amp; S_IFMT) == S_IFDIR)</code>  Alternatively, you can write <code>if(S_ISDIR(s.st_mode))</code>  The same applies to the other tests.</li>

<p>This API does feel fluent for consumers to use. 
You have also included some features I missed in the post you were inspired by.</p>

<ul>
<li>various severity levels [warning, error]</li>
<li>custom error messages (<em>although t3chb0t did comment he was working on this</em>)</li>
</ul>

<p>What I'm still missing is a way to throw an exception if I want to. Currently, your API is a sand-box. You could foresee <code>ThrowOnError</code> and <code>ThrowOnWarning</code>. Perhaps also with overloads that take an exception type. If multiple errors/warnings are found, they should be wrapped in an <code>AggregateException</code>.</p>

<pre><code>private static void DoTheValidation&lt;T&gt;(Validator&lt;T&gt; validator, T source)
{
    var result = source.ValidateWith(validator).ThrowOnError().Result;
}
</code></pre>
    </div>

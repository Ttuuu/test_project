<li><p>you should define <code>float failureRate = 0;</code> inside the <code>for (int i = 1; i &lt;= N; ++i)</code> loop, because you are not using it outside the loop. See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7959573/declaring-variables-inside-loops-good-practice-or-bad-practice">this</a> for more info.</p></li>
<li><p>When you calculate <code>failureRate</code>, just cast one of <code>usersOnStage.get(i)</code> or <code>total</code> to float. You don't need to cast both.</p></li>
<li><p><code>else {failureRate = 0 / total;}</code> is redundant because you'll always set failureRate to 0, which is its default value.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As for optimization to make it faster, since this piece of code is likely to be used in a video game, <code>stages</code> should be a small list, where efficiency of the algorithm doesn't matter much. You'd probably want to use simpler data structures, for a smaller overhead.</p>

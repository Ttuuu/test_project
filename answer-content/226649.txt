  <p>The other thing that might make the code run slower is I am creating an arrow for each line, but I want the arrow to point correctly relative to the direction of travel so I need to manually calculate the direction of the arrow, which I believe is also making the code run slower.</p>

<p>That would be it.  <code>trace_creator()</code> alone takes 10s on my machine, which is basically all of the runtime for me.</p>

<p>Half of it is <code>go.Scattergeo</code> calls, the other <code>fig.add_trace</code>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I don't know the library, but, I imagine there most be some construction where you're only adding a single <code>Scattergeo</code> with all of those paths included.  If not, then, perhaps they can be grouped and so the number of them could be reduced from the ~1k of them?</p>

<p>How did I find out?</p>

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7370801/measure-time-elapsed-in-python">This post</a> for how to time a block of code.  I inserted some <code>timeit</code> timers and just narrowed it down.</p>

<p>The other options is, as was already said, to use <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/582336/how-can-you-profile-a-python-script">a profiler</a>.</p>

<p>One thing to note is how much space you are allowed to use. You can use up to <code>O(n)</code> space, (enough to make a full copy of your data). Your code currently is slow because it uses <code>O(n)</code> <code>in</code> statements, each of which are <code>O(n)</code>. This means that if only there existed a data structure on which <code>in</code> statements were <code>O(1)</code>, you would have solved your problem. Thankfully <code>Set</code> has exactly this property. Therefore, the only change you need to make to your solution is turn your <code>list</code> into a <code>set</code>.</p>

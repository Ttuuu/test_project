<p>OK so a few points to neaten things up:</p>

<ul>
<li>Multiline strings are available in Python like so:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>s = """
Line 1
Line 2
"""
</code></pre>

<p>Use these where possible to avoid all the <code>'\n'</code> characters and needless speech marks when printing multiline blocks.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Generally speaking, lay out your code with all function definitions at the top and the body of the program below. Currently, you have one <code>print</code> statement and a call to <code>mainmenu()</code> in the middle of the functions getting lost.</p></li>
<li><p><code>BasicIncome</code> shouldn't really be using <code>monthly_income</code>, <code>monthly_hours</code> etc. from the global scope. (Off the top of my head I'm not even sure if it will work like that!) Pass them as arguments to the function if you really need them.</p></li>
<li><p>Your function names could be more informative. Take <code>bills</code> and <code>budget</code> for example: a good way to name them put the name into a sentence "The role of this function is to {{function_name}}". <code>printBills</code> and <code>printBudget</code> would probably be more appropriate here.</p></li>
<li><p>In <code>bills</code> and <code>expenses</code>, there is no need to return all of the arguments to the functions at the end. You haven't modified them in any way therefore anything that called the function will actually already have access to them!</p></li>
<li><p>Try and stick to strict naming conventions. You have mixed PascalCase (e.g. <code>UserInput</code>) and snake_case (e.g. expense_one) variables.</p></li>
<li><p>You might want to do some input validation. Consider what would happen if somebody enters "none" as their income.</p></li>
<li><p>I think at the bottom of your program, you might want <code>elif UserInput.upper() == "QUIT":</code>. Currently a typo will quit your program</p></li>
</ul>

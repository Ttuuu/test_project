<p>Thanks for sharing your code!</p>

<p>I'll begin by pointing out you don't need <code>global</code> variable, and you should avoid them when possible. Very often it only does make your code less readable and more fragile.</p>

<p>Here your function <code>wordcount_initial</code> could be rewritten as: (same idea for <code>wordcount_final</code>)</p>

<pre><code>def wordcount_initial(input_file):
    """Return the number of words in the file given in parameter

       :param input_file: A file name
       :type input_file: string 
       :return: The number of words in the file `input_file`
       :rtype: int
    """
    num_words_initial = 0
    with open(input_file, 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            words = line.split()
            num_words_initial += len(words)
    return num_words_initial
</code></pre>

<p>There are a few changes here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Removed <code>num_words_initial</code> as a global and return it's value at the end of the function. It's much more clean to return value that way when you can. It also help when you want to test your functions.</li>
<li>Gives <code>input_file</code> as a parameter of your function instead of relying on another global. It makes your function more reusable.</li>
<li>And I transformed your comment in docstring that can be used to generate documentation for your code. See <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html#user-documentation" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ReStrusctured</a> and <a href="http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">sphinx</a> for more information. Ideally every function should be documented (and every module too)</li>
</ul>

<p>Another remark, you name your function <code>dupfilter</code>, but every other name in your code has the format <code>first_last</code> which is a bit inconsistant. Also, don't try to gain a few letters when typing, write <code>duplicatefilter</code> or better (in my opinion) <code>filter_duplicate</code>.</p>

<p>Naming is always a bit subjective, use your best judgement.</p>

<p>And finally in your <code>__main__</code> you could have put the logic for initialising the name of the file into another function but that's not very important.</p>

<p>On a more positive note I like how you laid out your code, it is well spaced, most of the name are clear when you read them and you have comment which is often important.</p>

<p>Nice job!</p>

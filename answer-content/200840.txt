  <p>I think interviewer will not be convinced with this solution because here it is no test of logic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not sure what you mean by "because here it is no test of logic," but if what you mean is "because I found this puzzle too easy," then <em>good!</em> That's what the interviewer is likely to be hiring for: people who solve problems easily and quickly.</p>

<p>When you get an easy problem in an interview, that may be a sign that the interviewer is trying to judge your <em>coding skills</em> rather than your <em>algorithmic/research skills</em>. So make sure your <em>code</em> is as polished as (reasonably) possible.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>areAnagrams</code> takes its parameters by non-const reference. This is probably a bug. The interviewer will ask you to "explain your choice." Your answer should be something like "oops, I forgot to remove the <code>&amp;</code>." (This reflects a little badly on your coding skills.)</p></li>
<li><p><code>if (res == 1)</code> is a <em>very</em> strange way to test for boolean <code>true</code>-ness. It would be less unusual, but still a minor yellow flag, to test for <code>if (res == true)</code> or <code>if (res)</code>. It would be <em>good</em> to remove the useless variable and test directly for <code>if (areAnagrams(str1, str2))</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Similarly, in the body of <code>areAnagrams</code>, you have written</p>

<pre><code>if (str1.compare(str2) == 0)
{
    return true;
}
else
{
    return false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is a <em>very</em> long-winded and confusing way of writing</p>

<pre><code>return str1 == str2;
</code></pre>

<p>and is kind of a big deal. The interviewer is not looking to hire people who write eight lines of convoluted code when one line of simple code would do the job.</p>

<p>You also have an extra blank line at the beginning of <code>areAnagrams</code>; this shows a possible tendency toward sloppiness. The interviewer is not looking to hire people who might "typo" their way into a bug.</p>

<hr>

<p>On the plus side, your definition of <code>toLower</code> is very good!  The interviewer might ask you to explain why you took by value instead of by <code>const&amp;</code>. The interviewer might ask you whether the line <code>return str;</code> makes a copy of the string or whether the copy is elided. (Trick question! The answer is "neither.")</p>

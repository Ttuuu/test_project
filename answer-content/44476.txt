<p>I'm curious about why the code starts with <code>if (x &gt; -1</code></p>

<p>Doesn't that mean you need to scan values of i which end up doing nothing?</p>

<p>Perhaps you could skip those stages; something like:</p>

<pre><code>var initial_i = 0;
if (start.X &lt; 0)
    // need a bigger i to make it visible
    initial_i = -start.X / uX;
</code></pre>

<p>The above needs to be changed in uX can be negative, and beware floating point and divide by zero.</p>

<p>Do something similar (i.e. increase <code>initial_i</code>) to ensure that <code>y</code> is visible.</p>

<p>Then do something similar to ensure that i is not too large.</p>

<p>Then you ought to be able to have code like,</p>

<pre><code>Parallel.For(initial_i, ending_i, i =&gt;
//for (var i = 0; i != steps; ++i)
{
    var x = start.X + uX * i;
    var y = start.Y + uY * i;
    // if (x &gt; -1 &amp;&amp; y &gt; -1 &amp;&amp; x &lt; width &amp;&amp; y &lt; height)
    buf[(int)y * width + (int)x] = col;
}
</code></pre>

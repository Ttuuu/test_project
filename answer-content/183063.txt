<p>For quaranteed convex shapes like in your example, it might be worth breaking the Bresenham algorithm for the outside polylines apart and insert the horizontal stripe start and end coordinates into a vector every time the vertical coordinate reaches the next stripe position. This can save you the time to calculate start and end points of the horizontal stripes twice.</p>

<p>Once your shape is closed, draw the stripes from the pre-calculated start and end points in the vector.</p>

<p>Doesn't work for concave shapes, though.</p>

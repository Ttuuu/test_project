<p>Your variable names are way too long. If you extract the pretty-printing into a function called <code>FormatFrenchPhone</code>, the variables can be much shorter:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>basic</code> — doesn't convey any meaning, just remove it</li>
<li><code>phone</code> — that's clear from the context, just remove it</li>
<li><code>number</code> – this part provides useful information</li>
<li><code>array</code> — that's clear from the variable declaration already</li>
</ul>

<p>This leaves you with the name <code>number</code>, which i don't like because it's ambiguous in English. It can either mean the mathematical concept or the identification of something. (An employee number does not need to be numeric at all, for example.) I would instead name that variable <code>digits</code>. The plural s already says it's a slice or an array or a collection.</p>

<p>The other variable should be called <code>pretty</code>. It should be declared as <code>var pretty strings.Builder</code> if you want your code to look good, and <code>pretty := make([]rune, len(digits) + (len(digits)+1)/2)</code> if you want to avoid unnecessary memory allocation at every cost.</p>

<p>Since you come from a Java background, using <code>strings.Builder</code> should feel familiar.</p>

<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>Not a comment on functionality, but here:</p>

<pre><code>const wideImg = document.querySelector('.full-width-image-atf img'),
      captionText = wideImg.getAttribute('alt'),
      captionInnerHTML = '&lt;span class="image-caption"&gt;' + captionText + '&lt;/span&gt;',
      caption = document.createElement('div');
</code></pre>

<p>I don't think chaining declarations using <code>,</code> like you are is a good idea for a couple reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It isn't immediately clear that all the variables involved are being declared as <code>const</code>. Yes, you can tell if you check the indentation, or notice the commas at the end, but it isn't as clear as explicit <code>const</code>s all the way down.</p></li>
<li><p>It makes refactoring more of a pain. Say in the future you want to break that up and maybe stick a <code>log</code> call in there or some other non-declaration. Now you need to manually replace the commas with semi-colons, <strong>and remember to add <code>const</code> to all the now separate declarations</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I'd suggest just writing it out fully from the start, and maybe space out the last one since it has a separate purpose:</p>

<pre><code>const wideImg = document.querySelector('.full-width-image-atf img');
const captionText = wideImg.getAttribute('alt');
const captionInnerHTML = '&lt;span class="image-caption"&gt;' + captionText + '&lt;/span&gt;';

const caption = document.createElement('div');
</code></pre>
    </div>

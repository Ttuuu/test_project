<p>Some suggestion, I have seen you used a method called to <code>getStringRepresentation()</code> in the <code>Draw</code> class to print a representation of the object: for all classes you can use the common method <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#toString--" rel="nofollow noreferrer">toString</a>, overriding it for every class with the <code>@Override</code> annotation. You can then use in your code <code>System.out.println("Your guess: " + draw)</code> instead of  <code>System.out.println("Your guess: " + draw.getStringRepresentation())</code> obtaining the same result. It seems me from your code that you have multiple Scanner instances referring to stdin inside your classes; it should be better encapsulate the scanner in one place and call it from every class that use it, see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19766566/java-multiple-scanners">this</a> for details.</p>

<h2>Excess controllers?</h2>
<p>This code appears to be similar to several examples of UI Bootstrap datepickers - e.g. <a href="http://embed.plnkr.co/OVh5h7GJYkthVwCUkZwJ/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this plunker</a>. Initially the layout looked fine but then I realize that there are three total instances of <code>DatePickerController</code> - one for each <code>&lt;date-picker&gt;</code> plus the wrapping <code>&lt;div ng-controller="DatePickerController as dp"&gt;</code>. My presumption is that you should be able to implement this without that wrapping <code>DatePickerController</code> but maybe there is something I am missing.</p>
<h2>Descriptive function/class names</h2>
<p>I noticed that the functions for the controller and the directive are named <code>Controller</code> and <code>directive</code>, respectively. Most widely-accepted style guides call for class names in <code>UpperCamelCase</code> while method/function names should be in <code>lowerCamelCase</code> (e.g. the <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html#naming" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Google Style Guide</a>). As your application grows it would be advisable to make the function names more descriptive - e.g. <code>datePickerController</code> and <code>datePickerDirective</code>.</p>
<h2>Functions only called once</h2>
<p>Do the methods <code>toggleDepartDate()</code> and <code>toggleReturnDate()</code> in <code>FormDatepickerController</code> get called anywhere other than the controller initializer (i.e. immediately after they are declared)? If not, then the functionality within them could be moved outside the functions.</p>
<h2>IIFEs could be combined</h2>
<p>There are two <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE" rel="nofollow noreferrer">IIFE</a>s in <strong>datepicker-controller.js</strong>. Those could be combined into a single IIFE because there isn't any reason to have them separated (at least code-wise).</p>

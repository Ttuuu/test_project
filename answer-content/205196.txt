<p>Your <code>+(number == 1)</code> code is tricky and non-obvious.  Why is 1 a special case (yes, I know for exact powers of 10).  Why is adding a Boolean to an integer count a valid operation, and what does it do, or is it an implementation dependent undefined operation?</p>

<p>Can we rewrite the code to be clear, without needing a C Reference Manual kept handy?  Sure!</p>

<pre><code>int length(double number) {
     int result = 0; 
     if (number &lt; 0) number *= -1.0;

     while (number &gt;= 1) {
         result++; 
         number /= 10.0;
     }
     return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>If the number becomes exactly equal to 1, because of <code>&gt;=</code>, we take one last pass through the loop.</p>

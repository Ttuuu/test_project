<p>An immediate problem is that <code>is_prime()</code> is expensive, and you call it too many times. Prepare a sufficiently large list of primes in advance (and use a sieve for that).</p>

<p>This will give you a certain performance boost, but I am positive it will not be enough to avoid timeouts. The real problem is with the algorithm: you try to factorize the numbers, and the factorization is hard.</p>

<p>Instead of bruteforcing, do the math homework: how many numbers in the range have a prime <span class="math-container">\$p\$</span> as a factor? Hint: if there are <code>N</code> of them, they'd contribute <code>N * p</code> to the answer.</p>

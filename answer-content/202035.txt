<p>You're using the C++ versions of the C headers (e.g. <code>&lt;cstdio&gt;</code>).  That's a good thing, as it puts the identifiers into the <code>std</code> namespace where they can be unambiguous.</p>

<p>It seems that your implementation also defines these names in the global namespace, but <em>you cannot depend on that</em>.  So you need to qualify the names you use: <code>std::size_t</code>, <code>std::malloc</code> (why not <code>new[]</code>?), <code>std::FILE</code>, <code>std::fopen</code>, <code>std::fread</code>, <code>std::fclose</code>, <code>std:free</code> (and any that I've missed).</p>

<p>Oh, and <code>sizeof (char)</code> is always 1, since <code>sizeof</code> reports in units of <code>char</code>.</p>

<p>Have you considered using OpenMP rather than creating and destroying threads directly?  It may also help with vectorizing your code, too.</p>

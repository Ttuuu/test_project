<p>My first observation is that your object model is quite confusing; you have a vector of pairs with vectors, and it is very difficult to keep track of what is what.  If I'm reading this code correctly, you should consider extracting this pair into a <code>column</code> class, giving you <code>std::vector&lt;column&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Once you have this <code>column</code> class, you can add additional properties to it, such as what type of data it contains, and a <code>void*</code> to the data in each cell.</p>

<p>In addition to Eric Stein's great remarks:</p>

<p>1) You should always store "magic numbers" - in this case the number of coupons needed for a free bar - in a constant. Especially in a case where you use the same number in multiple places (possibly in multiple files) and you need to change that number, things go very wrong, if you miss any of those numbers.</p>

<pre><code>private final int NUMBER_OF_COUPONS_FOR_ADDITIONAL_BAR = 6;
</code></pre>

<p>2) There is no need to use a loop here to calculate the values here. Using integer division and the modulo operation they can be calculated directly. To find the formulas I used pencil and paper any write down the results for the money amounts 1 to 16 and used that to identify patterns. People with more practice could probably determine them directly from the text.</p>

<pre><code>final int money = userInput.nextInt();

int chocolateBars = money + (money - 1) / (NUMBER_OF_COUPONS_FOR_ADDITIONAL_BAR - 1);
int coupons = (money - 1) % (NUMBER_OF_COUPONS_FOR_ADDITIONAL_BAR - 1) + 1;

System.out.println("You will have total of " + chocolateBars + " bars and " + coupons + " coupons left.");
</code></pre>

<p>(EDIT: Just realized the task explicitly asks for a loop, oh well)</p>

<p>I fully agree with the <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/217539/98493">answer</a> by <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/8639/bailey-parker">@BaileyParker</a>. I have basically no idea what any of your variables are. Or what your code is actually supposed to achieve. And indeed, there is probably a better way to achieve what you want in this case. However, knowing how to do string and list parsing efficiently is also sometimes necessary, so this is how you could have done that better.</p>

<p>In your code, most of the lines are spent on removing unneeded strings from a list. Instead of manually removing each one of them (and even adding guards for the ones you know might not even exist in the list, hoping you don't miss any of those), just define a blacklist of terms you never want in your list and exclude them. If you choose a <code>set</code> as a data structure for that blacklist, you only need to iterate once over your list and checking if each element is in the blacklist is <span class="math-container">\$\mathcal{O}(1)\$</span>, making this algorithm <span class="math-container">\$\mathcal{O}(n)\$</span>.</p>

<p>Your code on the other hand is <span class="math-container">\$\mathcal{O}(n)\$</span> for every single term you remove, because the whole list needs to be checked for the item in the worst case, and twice that if you first check if a term exists in the list with <code>in</code>, which is also <span class="math-container">\$\mathcal{O}(n)\$</span>. This makes your code <span class="math-container">\$\mathcal{O}(nk)\$</span> with <span class="math-container">\$n\$</span> the list of methods and <span class="math-container">\$k\$</span> the number of terms you want removed.</p>

<pre><code>blacklist = {"instance", "of", ...}

for methods in c.Win32_VideoController():
    methods = [m for m in str(methods).split() if m not in blacklist]
    # do something with it
</code></pre>

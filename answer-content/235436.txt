<p>Here's a simplified version of this code:</p>

<pre><code>from typing import Dict, List

def kdo_pack():
    gifts: List[int] = []
    gift_time: Dict[int, str] = {
        1: "half second",
        2: "one second",
        5: "2 seconds",
    }
    sled_capacity = 12

    # Pack the gifts onto the sled!
    while sum(gifts) &lt; sled_capacity:
        try:
            gift = int(input(
                "type the size, 1 (for 1kg),2 (for 2kg) or 5 (for 5 kg) \n"
            ))
            print(
                'It will take me {} because the size of the gift is  {} kg'
                    .format(gift_time[gift], gift)
            )
        except (KeyError, ValueError):
            break
        gifts.append(gift)

    # Deliver the gifts!
    print("list of gift is the following : ", gifts)
    while gifts:
        if len(gifts) % 5 == 0:
            print(len(gifts))
            print("I stop, give me reindeer milk !")
            break
        gifts.pop()
        print("there are only {} gifts to deliver".format(len(gifts)))

kdo_pack()

<p>It's not completely clear to me how the class is meant to be used, but in the context of the script you've given I don't think it needs to be a class at all; you're just doing a fixed sequence of steps and there's no result other than what gets printed to the console.</p>

<p>Since the program would halt prematurely if the user inputted an invalid value, I modified it to break and move on to the next step instead since that makes it easier to test without having to fill the entire sled.  Beyond that, I'm not sure what else to suggest since I'm not sure what the original intent was, but hopefully seeing the simplified code gets you thinking about ways to streamline your future efforts -- the rule of thumb is not to write code that you don't need to.  :)</p>

  <p>Sometimes, when I press two keys too quickly, the snake turns around and bites itself. How do I stop that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That happens because the Snake changes directions twice before moving. You already have a variable called <code>keyPressed</code> in <code>GameLoop.java</code>. You need to set it to false after <code>Painter</code> update. And you need to set it to true on <code>Main.java</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code>canvas.setOnKeyPressed(e -&gt; {
        Snake snake = grid.getSnake();
        if (loop.isKeyPressed()) {
            return;
        }
        loop.setKeyPressed();
        ...
</code></pre>

<p>No <code>synchronized</code> block is necessary since there's only one thread for the key pressing.</p>

<p>Neat code, thanks for sharing it.</p>

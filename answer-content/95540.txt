<p>Beside everything that's being said by others already:</p>

<p>I think you have a security problem in your <code>register</code> function. You do check whether the <code>username</code> and <code>password</code> aren't blank, but you don't check whether this user already exists. I think you should also test*:</p>

<pre><code>if username in users:
    print("Username already exists")
    continue
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise someone could easily overwrite/register a new user <code>root</code> with his own credentials.</p>

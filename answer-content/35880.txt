<p>While the code is crisp and clean (COBOL always is .... ;-) ) I see some logic flaws in your computations.</p>

<p>Specifically, consider the current time <code>14450000</code> (2:45pm) and the user enters <code>15</code> for [HH] and <code>15</code> for [MM] as his ETA (3:15pm)</p>

<p>Your subtract will store the difference between <code>14450000</code> and <code>15150000</code>. The difference stored in <code>ETA-NUMERIC</code> will be <code>00700000</code>, and the code will display <code>HOURS:00</code> and <code>MINUTES:70</code>, but, we know that there's only 30 minutes between them.</p>

<p>The code does not take in to account that minutes are base-60.</p>

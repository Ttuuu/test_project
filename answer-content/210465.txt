<p>You have made a nice looking query here. I just have to nit-pick a little bit.  </p>

<ul>
<li>You query the table <code>Posts</code> with a synonym <code>q</code> where I would expect <code>p</code> instead. I know you want to indicate that it is a question but nevertheless I would expect <code>p</code> instead of <code>q</code>.  </li>
<li>Every sql-statement is written in capital-letters but the <code>AS</code> keyword is written in lower-case-letters.</li>
</ul>

<p>What you didn't take into account is the entering of a tag-synonym which would be  nice to have as well.</p>

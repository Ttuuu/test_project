<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>There are some issues with the code:</p>

<ul>
<li>isBracketBalanced - Should be plural. It checks more than one bracket.</li>
<li>bracketIsBalanced - Is basically the same name as the parent function, except it does more than just check if the bracket is balanced. It also manipulates the stack. </li>
<li>braces - Didn't we just call them brackets?</li>
<li>expectCloseStack declaration - This is perhaps just my personal preference, but to me, writing the declaration after a comma like that makes me look twice to see if it is part of the object that was declared above it.</li>
</ul>

<p>All in all, I find this solution a bit harder to read than the original. Also, it's actually not more concise.</p>

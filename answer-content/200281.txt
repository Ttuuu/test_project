<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p><code>l.count(i)</code> will look at every element in <code>l</code>, so it is <strong>O(n)</strong>.  We're doing this for each element we see, making the entire loop <strong>O(nÂ²)</strong>.</p>

<p>A more efficient solution will use extra storage to reduce that complexity.  I recommend storing each <code>x</code> into a <code>set</code>.  If it's already in the <code>set</code>, then it's a duplicate, so print it, else add it to the set and print nothing.</p>

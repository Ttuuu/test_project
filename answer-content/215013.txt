<p>There are few guidelines which I would follow while coding in Ruby:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Indentation in Ruby is 2 spaces.</p></li>
<li><p>In any program or project, improve understanding of the project by using proper documentation. Like Java has Javadoc for documentation, Ruby has Tomdoc, which helps in providing documentation to project.</p></li>
<li><p>Rubocop is a gem in Ruby, which can be installed on the local system, and from project location, when we run rubocop gives warning on style.</p></li>
<li><p><code>attr_reader</code> method is used to read variables; <code>attr_writer</code> method is used to write variables. To both read and write, we use <code>attr_accessor</code>. In your case <code>balance</code> is read and written, so we can use <code>attr_accessor</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Usually in Banking sector, the menu option repeats after transaction. Even in your case that can be achieved, by providing <code>wcase</code> statement in the <code>while</code> loop and the menu can have another option: <code>exit :e</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Pin is unique for each user; we can prompt user to enter pin rather than hardcoding it. </p></li>
<li><p>We can use proper exception Handling. Instead of just printing the error message we can raise the error and rescue the error message from calling application.</p></li>
</ul>

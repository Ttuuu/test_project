<h2>Function prefix qualifiers</h2>
<p>I seem to remember this being covered in your reviews before, but:</p>
<pre><code>const inline size_t find(const size_t x)
</code></pre>
<p>This benefits from neither of the <code>const</code> declarations nor the <code>inline</code>. Both the return value and the argument are passed-by-value scalars and do not benefit from <code>const</code>. <code>inline</code>, for all intents and purposes, has no effect, particularly where a compiler is told to optimize your code - and even if it <em>did</em> have an effect, it's a bad idea to tell the optimizer what it should and shouldn't inline. It will understand what's good for your code better than the programmer does 99% of the time.</p>
<p>If these concepts are confusing or difficult to apply to code on a practical basis, that is understandable - feel free to ask follow-up questions.</p>

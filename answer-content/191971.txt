<h1>Use of <code>_t</code></h1>

<p>You <em>may</em> want to reconsider use of <code>_t</code> endings in your type names.
In short, most of the standard type names use this, and the general practice is to not do so with user-defined types.</p>

<p>To quote POSIX:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To allow implementors to provide their own types, all conforming applications are required to avoid symbols ending in "_t", which permits the implementor to provide additional types.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a basic example:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct Subcommand {
    char **argument; // Array of arguments
    size_t size;     // Number of arguments
} Subcommand;
</code></pre>

<p>This is an interesting piece of code. You have clearly tried to make it look better. Well done.</p>

<hr>

<ul>
<li>I recently read in Refactoring book following about comments. Thick comments means code is bad.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Comments aren’t a bad smell; indeed they are a sweet smell. The reason
  we mention comments here is that comments are often used as a
  deodorant. It’s surprising how often you look at thickly commented
  code and notice that the comments are there because the code is bad.</p>

<ul>
<li>Do not specify what your code is doing.

<ul>
<li>Anyone who want's to read your code will know python or will know how to learn it.</li>
<li>You are not writing a tutorial.</li>
<li>Explain your intent.</li>
<li>Avoid obvious comments.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Specify why you decide to do it that way.</li>
</ul>

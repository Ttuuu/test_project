<p>Making a package for a one-class program seems like overkill.  You would be better off naming the class <code>AreaCalculator</code>, which would be more meaningful than <code>Main</code>.</p>

<p>Instead of writing the menu as a very long string, it would be more manageable to split it:</p>

<pre><code>System.out.println("Welcome to the Area Calculator! " +
    "Enter 1 to find the area of a Rectangle, " +
    "Enter 2 to find the area of a Square, " +
    "Enter 3 to find the area of a Triangle or " +
    "Enter 4 to find the area of a Circle");
</code></pre>

<p>(This has no effect on performance.  The compiler will embed just one long string constant in the bytecode.)</p>

<p>A chain of if-elses would be better written using a <code>switch</code> block.  Not only is it easier to see the patten at a glance, it is also more efficient, in that it compiles to a single <code>tableswitch</code> opcode.</p>

<p>Since there are so many places where you write <code>System.out.println()</code> followed by <code>scanner.nextInt()</code>, it makes sense to write a function for that.  Should you later decide to add validation and error handling, you can implement it in one central place.  I suggest changing <code>System.out.println()</code> to <code>System.out.print()</code>.</p>

<p>I don't see any reason why the inputs should be restricted to <code>int</code>s.  You could just as easily accept <code>double</code>s.</p>

<p>I recommend splitting each calculation into a separate function, to ensure that they do not interfere with each other.  For example, if you were to add support for parallelograms and trapezoids, you might have a conflict for a variable named <code>height</code>, if you lumped everything into <code>main()</code>.  The resulting <code>main()</code> would be just a menu.</p>

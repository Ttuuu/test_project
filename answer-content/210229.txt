<p>+1 to @Dair's suggestions. Also, your <code>isSafe</code> (which should be called <code>is_safe</code> - snake_case is standard in Python) can be simplified, although I'm a little shaky on what you're trying to accomplish with your logic.</p>

<p>First, I'll suggest that you rename your arguments to <code>row_index</code> and <code>col_index</code>.</p>

<p>I had started re-writing your <code>for</code> loops as list comprehensions using <code>any</code> (which you should still do), but I ran into some questionable logic.</p>

<p>You say "check left row", by which I think you actually mean "check the left-hand side of the row containing (row_index, col_index)". If that's true, why are you iterating with <code>y</code>? Isn't that <code>x</code>?</p>

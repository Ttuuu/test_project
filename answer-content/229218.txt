<p>One possible solution is using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>zip()</code></a>. This allows you to iterate, in your case, through multiple lists at a time. You can also condense creating the lists into one line. And, you can remove assigning <code>dynamic_viscosity_#/Density_PE_298k</code> to a variable, just append that to the lists. Consider the following:</p>

<pre><code>kinematic_viscosity, kinematic_viscosity_1, kinematic_viscosity_2 = [], [], []

for dynamic_viscosity, dynamic_viscosity_1, dynamic_viscosity_2 in zip(DV, DV_1, DV_2):
    kinematic_viscosity.append(dynamic_viscosity/Density_PE_298k)
    kinematic_viscosity_1.append(dynamic_viscosity_1/Density_PE_298k)
    kinematic_viscosity_2.append(dynamic_viscosity_2/Density_PE_298k)
</code></pre>

<p>While it looks more blocky, it allows you to only loop through the lists once.</p>

<p>Another solution is to keep the three loops, but append the returns directly into the list. Consider the following:</p>

<pre><code>kinematic_viscosity = [dynamic_viscosity/Density_PE_298k for dynamic_viscosity in DV]

kinematic_viscosity_1= [dynamic_viscosity_1/Density_PE_298k for dynamic_viscosity_1 in DV_1]

kinematic_viscosity_2= [dynamic_viscosity_2/Density_PE_298k for dynamic_viscosity_2 in DV_2]
</code></pre>

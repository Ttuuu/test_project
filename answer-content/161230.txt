<p>Obviously this is one of those things which is opinionated but:</p>

<p>1) It might be simpler to use <code>num.zero?</code> as your base case </p>

<p>2) I would pass the <code>spare</code> tower as a parameter rather than calculating it all the time.</p>

<p>Something like:</p>

<pre><code>def hanoi(num, from, to, spare)
  return [] if num.zero?                   # base case

  moves =  hanoi(num - 1, from, spare, to) # move everything to the spare peg
  moves &lt;&lt; Move.new(num, from, to)         # move the sole remaining disk to the 'to' peg
  moves += hanoi(num - 1, spare, to, from) # move all the disks on top of the 'to' peg
end
</code></pre>

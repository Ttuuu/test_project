<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<h3>Constants on top</h3>

<pre><code>look_in = "usb.txt"
...
Price = Quant * 5
</code></pre>

<p>The file to look in may reasonably change in the future as may the price per unit (currently 5).</p>

<p>I suggest writing the constants on top in UPPERCASE to allow easier modification of the program.</p>

<h3>Useless <code>.close()</code></h3>

<p><code>with</code> closes the file automatically so you can remove the <code>close</code> at the end of your code.</p>

<h3>Functionality modularization</h3>

<p>Finding the lines where a string is present given a text is one unit of work that is independent from the rest of the logic, so I would write a function for it.</p>

<p>Two words.</p>

<p><strong>Lookup tables.</strong></p>

<p>Here's one I randomly found on the internet:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/os0IP.png" alt="from www.blackjack-strategycard.com/blackjack-strategy-rules-multi-deck.htm"></p>

<p>All you gotta do is make a 2D array, populate it with the right values (enum?), and alter your <code>play(Card upCard)</code> method to use the lookup table.</p>

<p>That solves your complexity issue, your implicit data storage (you're trying to algorithmically map the values of 3 variables (card 1, card 2, dealer up card) to a lot of different values), and it should be a speedup too. Plus, what are blackjack explanations doing in your code?</p>

<p>Note that you might have to split your lookup table in three sections: One for the doubles, one for the case where you have an ace, and one for the last case, where you need to use the total of your hand.</p>

<hr>

<p>That said, looking at your code, there's some things that could also look a bit differently:</p>

<pre><code>getHand().get(0).getName().equals("Ace") |
getHand().get(1).getName().equals("Ace")
</code></pre>

<p>Seems like this could get wrapped into a method called <code>containsCard(String name)</code>. I'm worried about a single pipe though - Isn't it <code>||</code>?</p>

<pre><code>getHand().get(0).getName().equals("Ace") &amp;
getHand().get(1).getName().equals("Ace")
</code></pre>

<p>Same thing here: this could be <code>boolean hasPair()</code>. Also, isn't it <code>&amp;&amp;</code>?</p>

<pre><code>getHand().get(0).getName().equals("Two") |
getHand().get(1).getName().equals("Two") &amp;
upCard.getValue() &gt;= 5 &amp; upCard.getValue() &lt;= 6
</code></pre>

<p>This looks like it contains a bug.</p>

<p>Let's rephrase it:</p>

<pre><code>firstCard is "Two" |
secondCard is "Two" &amp;
(dealerCard is 5 or dealerCard is 6)
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the problem? (I'm not sure if using <code>|</code> compared to <code>||</code> prevents this from becoming a bug, but...) <code>||</code> short-circuit evaluates. Basically, if <code>firstCard is "Two"</code> is true, then the whole if statement is true. Whoops.</p>

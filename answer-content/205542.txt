<p>Good for the first try, but there are a lot of things to improve.</p>

<h2>Too many indirections</h2>

<p><code>std::shared_ptr</code> -&gt; <code>std::unique_ptr</code>, because no multithreading is perceived in the usage cases, <code>std::unique_ptr</code> is much more lightweight, albeit being a little bit harder to use. It compiles down to safe code written by hand.</p>

<p><code>std::vector&lt;std::shared_ptr&lt;HashEntry&gt;&gt;</code> -&gt; <code>std::vector&lt;HashEntry&gt;</code>, because backwards links are not established anyway, and resizing is never done.</p>

<h2>Interface</h2>

<p>Not generic (e.g. not a template).</p>

<p>I would rather return empty <code>std::optional</code> than print a message to <code>stdout</code>.</p>

<p><code>HashEntry</code> should be private to the map.</p>

<p>I don't see any reason for <code>hash_func</code> to be public. It is not used outside of the class, nor is it stated that it is supposed to be used outside.</p>

<p><code>get</code> should be const member too.</p>

<p>Doesn't provide any way to iterate over entire map.</p>

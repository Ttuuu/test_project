<p>Your functions are called up, east, down, up. That's a strange combination of directions.</p>

<p>Either name them north, east, south, west. Or up, left, down, right.</p>

<p>Instead of saying <code>variable = variable + 1</code>, you can also say <code>variable += 1</code>, which is shorter and more to the point.</p>

<p>And for <code>variable += 1</code> there is another abbreviation, which is <code>variable++</code>.</p>

<p>I see nothing wrong with the code itself, but you're in dire need of docstrings. Arcane functional one-liners like the one in <code>intersperse</code> are impenetrable unless they're well-documented. You'd also benefit from splitting that one into multiple lines.</p>

<p>For strings like this:</p>

<pre><code>    return requests.get('https://api.github.com/repos/{}/{}/branches/master'.format(author, repo)).json()['commit']['commit']['tree']['sha']
</code></pre>

<p>consider rewriting your <code>format</code> call as an f-string; i.e.</p>

<pre><code>f'https://api.github.com/repos/{author}/{repo}/branches/master'
</code></pre>
    </div>

<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>There seems to be an error in this function (Parser.cpp):</p>

<pre><code>std::string Parser::getValueFromPassedCommand(std::string_view command) const
{
    for (const auto &amp;elem : arguments)
    {
        if (elem.find(command) != std::string::npos)
        {
            return elem.substr(elem.find('=') + 1);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>There is a missing return statement here.
There is also an inconsistency with the way variables are initialized, sometimes with = xx, sometimes with {xx}. I would also remove all the default initializers (empty {}) as these are redundant and flagged by rules in clang-tidy.
Still a nice job and seems like a good usage of C++17 functionalities.</p>

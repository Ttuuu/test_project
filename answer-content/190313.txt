<h2>Default value for constructor.</h2>

<p>Why does this produce a circle of radius 1 by default if the constructor has no parameters?  If the user hasn't specified the radius, they shouldn't get a result, surely?</p>

<p>Best practice here would be to make the default constructor (with no parameters) private.  If the calling code doesn't set the radius, it simply won't compile.</p>

<h2>No copy constructor.</h2>

<p>In this case it doesn't matter, because all you're doing is copying the value of <code>radius</code>.  The default copy constructor (which does a direct copy of the value of every member) will be fine here.  However if you allocated memory at any point, the default copy constructor goes very badly wrong because you can end up with two instances pointing at the same internal data.  When one deletes that data, the program will crash when the other one tries to access the data which is no longer there.</p>

<h2><code>getRadius</code> return type.</h2>

<p>Why is this returning a reference to double, instead of just double?</p>

<h2>Documentation.</h2>

<p>I know you're just starting out in C++, and this is just a trial run class, but it's good practice to document your class interface (and internal methods/data if relevant).  I suggest you look into <a href="http://www.doxygen.nl" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Doxygen</a>, which is generally the best-practise way of documenting C and C++ code.</p>

<h2>Avoid using C-style stdio in C++.</h2>

<p>It's not a big deal, but C++ style is generally to prefer streaming for I/O.  <code>std::cout</code> is generally preferred to <code>printf</code>.</p>

<p>There are a few small changes that I would make:</p>

<ul>
<li>Indent the bodies of <code>if/else</code> blocks.</li>
<li>Moving the <code>bye = 0</code> line to the top of the <code>else</code> block reduces code duplication, and it'll make your code more clear, because it will read like: 'if the input is "BYE", increase the 'bye' counter, else, reset it to 0'.</li>
<li>Ruby has a <code>+=</code> operator: <code>bye += 1</code> is shorthand for <code>bye = bye + 1</code>.</li>
<li>The name <code>bye</code> isn't very accurate, something like <code>bye_shouts_in_a_row</code> is probably better. Picking accurate, meaningful names is often difficult, but it can make code (much) easier to understand, and that makes working with it easier as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>Applying these gives the following result:</p>

<pre><code>puts "say hi to grandma"

bye_shouts_in_a_row = 0

while bye_shouts_in_a_row &lt; 3 do
  input = gets.chomp

  if input == "BYE"
    bye_shouts_in_a_row += 1
    puts "HEH?!"
  else
    bye_shouts_in_a_row = 0
    if input == input.upcase
      puts "NO, NOT SINCE " + rand(1930..1950).to_s + "!"
    else
      puts "HUH?! SPEAK UP SONNY!"
    end
  end
end

puts "EH?! OH, BYE DEAR!"
</code></pre>

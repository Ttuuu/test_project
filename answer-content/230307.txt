<p>If it's readability you're mostly worried about, then you could change the style of your code:</p>

<pre><code>public City(int id,          BlockPos startingPos,
            int citySize,    int edgeLenght, 
            int pathExtends, Block groundBlock,
            Block pathBlock, boolean hasMainStreets,
            boolean hasPaths) {
    this.id             = id;
    this.startingPos    = startingPos;
    this.chunkLength    = citySize;
    this.cityLength     = citySize * 16;
    this.edgeLength     = edgeLenght;
    this.mapLength      = cityLength + edgeLenght + blockStart;
    this.pathExtends    = pathExtends;
    this.hasMainStreets = hasMainStreets;
    this.hasPaths       = hasPaths;
    this.groundBlock    = groundBlock;
    this.pathBlock      = pathBlock;
    this.blockStart     = edgeLenght;

}

<p>Columnising is a useful trick which can make things more readable.</p>

<p>Yes, there is still visibly a lot of parameters clogging up the screen, but it's not so much that you can't put it all in one constructor. It also helps to remember KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), don't overcomplicate unless you need to.</p>

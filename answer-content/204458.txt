<p><a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_arithmetic" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Operator &amp;</a> is not short-circuit and always executes both operands and then combines them.</p>

<p>That appears to be crucial for the code: <code>feedback &amp;&amp; g[j]</code> and <code>g[0] &amp;&amp; feedback</code>.</p>

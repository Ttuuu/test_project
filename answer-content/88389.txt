<h2>Includes</h2>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>#include &lt;math.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>You're using C++. You really ought to <code>#include</code> the C++ versions of the headers instead of the C ones:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;cmath&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>Namespace</h2>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>using namespace std;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1452721/why-is-using-namespace-std-considered-bad-practice">This is a very bad idea.</a> It pollutes the global namespace with everything from <code>std</code>. If <code>std</code> gets updated and includes a symbol that conflicts with something in your project, you're in big trouble. It's not much work to prepend <code>std::</code> to your objects, but if you're really that lazy, just import what you need:</p>

<pre><code>using std::vector;
using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::endl;
</code></pre>

<h2>System calls</h2>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>system("CLS");
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Please don't do this. It makes your code completely non-portable. If you really must use an OS-dependent feature like this, at the very least isolate it in its own function, so you only have to change it one place instead of all through your code.</p>

<h2>Algorithm</h2>

<p>The way that's taught in high school for calculating the determinant of the matrix is rather inefficient (though simple to apply). The time is proportional to \$n!\$ -- that's right, factorial.</p>

<p>Especially on a computer, it's much better to get the determinant by one of the decomposition methods (basically, extended Gaussian elimination). This is an \$O(n^3)\$ process instead. Check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant#Calculation" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Wikipedia</a> for some ideas.</p>

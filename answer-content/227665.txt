<p>Immediately I'd ask if there's any specific style guide that allows
these vastly different names, otherwise I'd suggest following IDE hints
and/or a linter and rename the variables and methods to be more
consistent (e.g. <code>[cC]amelCase</code> for everything).</p>

<p>Also, "stuff" is not a great name for anything ... what stuff are we
talking about?  In fact the first line of <code>CreateStuff</code> already shows
that there's a better name, <code>tableName</code> for the parameter, probably
<code>createTable</code> for the method.  <code>yrmnth</code> is especially bad too, three
vowels saved from <code>yearMonth</code> and in the process made the name
unreadable for the casual observer.</p>

<p>Seems like the spark session is created twice and the comment even says
so - I'd suggest passing the variable into the method, that's fairly
straightforward by either passing it as a parameter, or extending <code>App</code>
with a member variable.</p>

<p>The SQL queries are created by concatenating strings and there's usually
better ways, here probably a query builder.</p>

<p><code>columnCount</code> is unused, <code>selectColumns2</code> has <code>2</code> as the suffix, even
though there's no <code>1</code>, that can just be <code>selectColumns</code>.</p>

<p>The loop for <code>columnStack</code> could be in its own method so it's a little
small section that could be tested on its own too, returning what is now
<code>collist</code>, <code>formatColumnsList(columns: Seq[String]): String</code> perhaps.
Again, if a query builder could do all this it would be a bit cleaner
than concatenating strings.</p>

<p>The construction for <code>yrmnth</code> is pretty convoluted for what it does, I'd
suggest finding a more succinct approach, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>val yearMonth = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("yyyyMM").format(LocalDateTime.now())
</code></pre>

<p>That would require a recent Java for <code>java.time.LocalDateTime</code> and
<code>java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter</code>.  But even without there should be
better ways.  If everything fails the whole section should at least be
in its own method, e.g. <code>formatDate(calendar Calendar): String</code>.</p>

<p>The bottom part of <code>unPivotDF</code> uses a temporary table - is that the best
way to go, or could the data be inserted directly?</p>

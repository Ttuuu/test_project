<p>Main feedback has already been given by @AJNeufeld and this post is not about the performance of your program but rather other aspects.</p>

<p>You should try putting a check before you access an index in an array and slightly change your if block from this,</p>

<pre><code>if (args[0].contains("help")) {
</code></pre>

<p>to,</p>

<pre><code>if (args.length == 0 || args[0].contains("help") || args.length &lt; 5) {
</code></pre>

<p>as the former will run into <code>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</code> if no argument is passed. Also it would be helpful to call the <code>displayHelp()</code> method in case no argument (<code>args.length == 0</code>) was passed so the user knows the usage of program.</p>

<p>Also, for safely accessing array indexes, you should put another <code>OR</code> condition <code>args.length &lt; 5</code> which will ensure at least five parameters are passed, else again you may run into <code>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</code>.</p>

<p>These checks should make the program a little more safer.</p>

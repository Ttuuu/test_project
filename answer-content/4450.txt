<p>It works on WinXP and Win2008_64b (JRE64b) and everything looks correct. For deepest tests, just click on each accessible <code>Component</code>s, without any errors.</p>
<p>But as I mentioned, selection on Network hanged (on WinXP, no errors, killed from IDE), JProgresBar too, in contrast with win2008, there ProgresBar works and just short time and diplay right contents of network tree.</p>

<p>My assumption about the Active Directory daemon (next only AD) is that I have local admin access for Intranet and it looks like as from end user PC by local admin account AD some*** restricted view for Network's tree, AD some*** managed this access, and I can't access the AD setting because that's an outsourced service.</p>

<li><p>WinXP SP3 SK LanguagePack (that isn't full localizations as Spain, Germany, ...) logged here by a local admin account click to Network icon in JTree died without any errors as I described twice.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Win7 64b SK (sorry no time for deepest analyses, only logged here by local admin account and runs your child out of console) icon in JTree returns null to the JTable and click by Open JButton and returns just a Win7 error.</p>

<li><p>Win2008 is access managed by AD accessible context, because there isn't possible to create local account (internal rules).</p>

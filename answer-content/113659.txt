<p>I have a few comments in addition to Caridorc's good comments:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Within <code>bayesian()</code> you convert to float, but before that you possibly use int</em> – When providing the parameters to this function you do some math, which could or could not be int operations. You might want to enforce the float at an earlier level</li>
<li><em>Change into a list of search engines</em> – Instead of duplicating your logic three times, I would change into storing the results in a list of list, and use a list of providers to keep addresses, search method, name of provider, and so on. This could simplify your logic, and would make it easier to extend to new providers.</li>
<li><em>No input validation</em> – What is the input format for latitude and longitude? I know there exists at least three or four different variants. Which variant is accepted by all of these search engines?</li>
<li><p><em>Split up into some more functions</em> – I like the way you call <code>main()</code> but I would have split it up into more functions, so it could read something like:</p>

<pre><code>def main():
   locations = get_location_list()
   restaurants = execute_search(locations, search_engines)
   rated_restaurants = calculate_restaurant_rating(restaurant)
   write_restaurants("data.csv", rated_restaurants)

   # Or the ugly version of the same...
   write_restaurants("data.csv", 
     calculate_restaurant-rating(
       execute_search(
         get_location_list(),
         SEARCH_ENGINES
       )
     )
   )
</code></pre>

<p>Having this functions defined would allow for your script to be used as a module in its logical parts, and you gather and manipulate the data according to different needs presenting it self. And still you could call it as a script to do a single search.</p></li>
</ul>

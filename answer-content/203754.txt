<p>Since most of the class is just getters and setters, there isn't much substantial to comment on.</p>

<p>The biggest problem I see is the <code>getColorName</code> method. It's doing unnecessary checks, and I usually reach for a <code>Map</code> in cases like this anyways. Map lookups are faster for for this, and are a little neater in my opinion. For this case, it would look like:</p>

<pre><code>Map&lt;Color, String&gt; colorToName = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();

colorToName.put(Color.BLACK, "Black");
colorToName.put(Color.WHITE, "White");
colorToName.put(Color.PINK, "Pink");
colorToName.put(Color.CYAN, "Cyan");
colorToName.put(Color.BLUE, "Blue");
colorToName.put(Color.GREEN, "Green");
colorToName.put(Color.GRAY, "Gray");
</code></pre>

<p>Then, to get the name, you'd do:</p>

<pre><code>colorToName.get(Color.PINK); // Returns "Pink"
</code></pre>

<p>You'll probably want to initialize <code>colorToName</code> as a static member of the class so it's not being recreated constantly.</p>

<hr>

<p>Notice how I'm ignoring the lowercase variants. That's because, if you look at the source:</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * The color pink.  In the default sRGB space.
 */
public final static Color pink      = new Color(255, 175, 175);

/**
 * The color pink.  In the default sRGB space.
 * @since 1.4
 */
public final static Color PINK = pink;
</code></pre>

<p>They refer to the same thing, so checking both is redundant.</p>

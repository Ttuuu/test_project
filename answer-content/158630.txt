<p>There is clearly no 'best way' to do this.
From a 'Numerical Analysis' approach,
you should never sum that way a series with alternating-sign terms:
loss of accuracy and slow convergence speed can be expected.
Use simple arithmetic to sum the terms in pairs,
and then iterate by two units at a time.
If you do this, you will gain
a lot both in accuracy and in convergence speed.
So the expression I would add is :</p>

<p>1 / (n*n + n)</p>

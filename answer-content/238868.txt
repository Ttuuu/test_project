<p>My first read of this code:</p>

<pre><code>    "The \"test\" command, as well as the \"[\" command, are not required to know",
    "the \"==\" operator. Only a few implementations like bash and some",
    "versions of ksh support it.",
</code></pre>

<p>was wrong; I didn't notice that it's actually a varargs-function accepting one line per argument. That's a little odd. This has the disadvantage of hard wraps regardless of actual console size, a significant departure from what people typically expect from a CLI. </p>

<p>The C-idiomatic way is to simply have one long string, potentially split onto multiple lines using implicit literal concatenation. The non-standardness of this pattern ties into my next point:</p>

<h2>C</h2>

<p>Prepare for me to editorialize:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>C is a dangerous programming language with lots of ways to shoot yourself in the foot</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You're right, and I don't particularly think that any of the structures you've put on top of it help to change that. In fact, you repeat some of the worst offenders, such as assignment-in-condition. In general I'd say that it isn't worth attempting to make C something that it isn't, and a much-smaller, idiomatic C program is easier to understand and maintain (particularly for others, if you open-source this) than a larger, non-idiomatic one.</p>

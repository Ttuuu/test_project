<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>You're throwing <code>System.Exception</code>. Don't do that. If you're going to have to throw an exception for a validation exception, throw a custom <code>ValidationException</code> exception.</p>

<p>You haven't shown the code where you <code>catch</code> and handle that exception, but it's going to have to look like this:</p>

<pre><code>try
{
    // some code
}
catch (Exception exception)
{
    // handle the [validation?] exception
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with that, is that you don't <em>know</em> if the exception you're catching is due to a validation error, or if there's a division by zero, or if you ran out of memory, or if a database connection failed. With a custom exception type, you can do this:</p>

<pre><code>try
{
    // some code
}
catch (ValidationException exception)
{
    // handle the validation exception
}
</code></pre>

<p>And any exception thrown that is <em>not</em> a <code>ValidationException</code>, will bubble up the stack.</p>

<hr>

<p>That said, I wouldn't throw an exception for that. Exceptions should be for <em>exceptional</em> things. If you already know how you're going to handle it (show the error message in a message box?), why not just do that instead of throwing?</p>

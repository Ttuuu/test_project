<p>You're creating a bunch of unnecessary vector copies. Try passing iterators into <code>FindMaximumSubarray</code> instead of a vector.</p>

<p>You can find the max of an initializer list of numbers using <code>std::max</code>.</p>

<p>You don't need to pass ints as const refs.</p>

<p>Your code looks like it might have potential overflow errors. Maybe that's not important.</p>

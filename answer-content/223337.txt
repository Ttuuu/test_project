<p>MySQL surely has some tools to help you profile the query, and you should try using those to at least identify the bottleneck. But there are three things which jump out at me.</p>

<ol>
<li>The formatting is not at all conducive to reading the query. Using indentation would go a long way; breaking the line before rather than after the keyword which introduces a clause (<code>FROM</code>, <code>WHERE</code>, etc.) would also help.</li>
<li><code>totalshops</code> does a <code>count</code> solely for <code>having totalshops &gt; 1</code>. Can that be rewritten as a <code>WHERE EXISTS</code>?</li>
<li>The distance calculation is serious overkill. You don't actually need the distance for the query: any strictly monotonic function of it would do. If you denormalise slightly and store Cartesian coordinates in addition to the latitude and longitude then a simple dot product with <code>DESC</code> sorting would work. If you need the distance in the presentation layer, calculate it there.</li>
</ol>

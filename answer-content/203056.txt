<p>I do not have much to say about the pipe operator. It looks fine to me, although maybe some else has something to say...</p>

<p>As for the <code>if-else</code> clause, you can use <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/case-cond-and-if.html#cond" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>cond</code></a>. It is basically a stylized <code>if</code> statement that looks like a <code>case</code> statement. One of your conditions can be <code>x &lt; 10 -&gt;</code> and the other default statement would be <code>true -&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>I am not entirely sure if this is the best practice since the wording is a bit ambiguous in the documentation. Under the use case for <code>cond</code> it says the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is equivalent to <code>else if</code> clauses in many imperative languages
  (although used way less frequently here).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which I interpret to be <code>else if</code> clauses are used less often (implying that <code>cond</code> is often preferred).</p>

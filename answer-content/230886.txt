<p><code>BowlingFrame</code> and <code>Roll</code> contain unused information.  <code>frame.roll1.isSpare</code> and <code>frame.roll2.isStrike</code> are never used.  It would make more sense for <code>isStrike</code> and <code>isSpare</code> to be members of <code>BowlingFrame</code>, at which point <code>Roll</code> would only contain <code>pinsKnockedDown</code>, so that class should be removed, and <code>BowlingFrame</code> instead contain two integers for the pin counts for roll 1 &amp; 2.</p>

<p>However, <code>isStrike</code> and <code>isSpare</code> are mutually exclusive, so perhaps an <code>enum</code> could be used to express <code>STRIKE</code> and <code>SPARE</code> states.  You could also add states for <code>UNPLAYED</code>, <code>PARTIAL</code> &amp; <code>FINISHED</code> to track whether or not there are rolls left in the frame.</p>

<p>The 10th frame scoring is flawed.  A strike grants two additional rolls; a spare grants one additional roll.  Neither of these are currently handled. </p>

<p>You can rearrange your equation:</p>

<p><span class="math-container">$$X^2 = Z + Y^2$$</span></p>

<p>Since you are solving where <span class="math-container">\$Z \ge 0\$</span>, then <span class="math-container">\$ |X| \ge |Y|\$</span>, so you can stop your inner loop when Y reaches X, instead of continuing up to 1000.</p>

<p>Alternately, loop for Y over the range 0..1000, calculate <span class="math-container">\$X^2\$</span>, and do a binary search on the range Y..1000, looking for the X with the desired square. </p>

<hr>

<p>Instead of:</p>

<pre><code>CMP AL,45 ;Ascii for minus
</code></pre>

<p>You should probably write:</p>

<pre><code>CMP AL,'-' ;Is the number negative?
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>It looks like the user can type <code>-123</code> as <code>123-</code> or <code>1-23</code> or even <code>-1-2--3-</code>.  You donâ€™t restrict the minus sign to only being the first character. </p>

<hr>

<p>Since <code>NumSign</code> is initialized to <code>1</code> by loading the code image, the code is only guaranteed to run correctly once.  Once a negative number has been entered, <code>NumSign</code> will be changed to <code>-1</code>, and will not be set back to <code>1</code> without reloading the program image.</p>

<p>You should use <code>NumSign DD ?</code> and explicitly set <code>NumSign</code> to <code>1</code> at the beginning of you code <code>MOV NumSign,1</code>, to allow the code to be executed move than once.</p>

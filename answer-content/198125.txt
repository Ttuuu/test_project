<p>From looking at your code, the main things I notice are:</p>

<ol>
<li>The unused imports at the top</li>
<li>The <code>__name__ == "__main__"</code> that isn't implemented correctly</li>
<li>The overly complicated and long lines that are hard to read</li>
</ol>

<p>If I were to solve this question in a pythonic way, I'd go with numpy. It provides both clarity and efficiency. The following solution works for any size of the input array, and is a lot more efficient for larger arrays.</p>

<pre><code>import numpy as np    

input_array = np.array([[1,1,1,0,0,0],
                        [0,1,0,0,0,0],
                        [1,1,1,0,0,0],
                        [0,0,2,4,4,0],
                        [0,0,0,2,0,0],
                        [0,0,1,2,4,0]])

# Since the I-shape has size 3x3, we want an array with two rows and 
# two columns fewer
shape = tuple(i-2 for i in input_array.shape)

# This denotes the shape of the I, with [0,0] being the upper left corner
offsets = [[0,0], [0,1], [0,2], [1,1], [2,0], [2,1], [2,2]]

result_array = np.zeros(shape, dtype=np.int64)

# Add all offsets to each value in result_array
for x,y in offsets:
    result_array += input_array[x:x+shape[0], y:y+shape[1]]

# The result_array will contain the sum of every I-shape for the input_array
print(result_array.max())
</code></pre>
    </div>

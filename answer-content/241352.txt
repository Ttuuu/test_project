<p>Your piece of code is logically incorrect in the following: your select query will return list of already filtered by username IDs - all ID will be the same. So there is no need to iterate over the list of identical IDs and assign each of them to <code>user_id</code>.</p>

<p>The idea to reassign data of different type and origin to the same variable (though this works) is bad since it decreases readability of the code and - worse - confuses your way of thinking when constructing the code.</p>

<p>I'd suggest the following code:</p>

<pre><code>import sqlite3

def get_user_id_from_usermane(db: sqlite3.Cursor, username: str) -&gt; str:
    user_id_row = db.execute("SELECT id FROM user WHERE username = ? LIMIT 1", (username, ))
    return user_id_row[0]
</code></pre>
    </div>

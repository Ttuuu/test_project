<ul>
<li>The <code>Plateau</code> class seems to be pretty unused:

<ul>
<li>It doesn't have actual behaviour, it only hosts the <code>get_plateau_size()</code> method.</li>
<li>That method should have a first parameter named <code>cls</code> by convention. <code>self</code> is only used for instances, but here you get the class itself, not an instance.</li>
<li>By that, it also returns a <code>Plateau</code>, because calling a class creates an instance. This is kind-of confusing, because I'd have expected some kind of size.</li>
<li>Further, the user interaction (<code>input()</code>) was unexpected here. Don't hide such usage details in classes that make sense on their own.</li>
<li>The call contains redundancy as well, <code>Plateau.get_plateau_size()</code> features the term "plateau" twice. Once would have been enough.</li>
<li>Anyhow, the result isn't even used, so this whole class could be removed!</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>LEFT_ROTATE</code> and <code>RIGHT_ROTATE</code> are both only used in a single function, no need to make them globals.</li>
<li>Take a look at the <code>dataclass</code> decorator ( <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html</a>), it could help you structure your classes a bit better. In particular, it would generate <code>__str__</code> for you.</li>
</ul>

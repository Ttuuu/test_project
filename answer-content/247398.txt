<p>I found the bug. It was in the <code>delete</code> function.</p>
<p>I was wrongly marking the self.curr pointer.</p>
<p>The correction is:</p>
<pre><code>def delete(self, val):
        curr = self.head
        prev = self.head
        while curr is not None:
            if curr.val == val:
                prev.next = curr.next
                break
            prev = curr
            curr = curr.next
        if not curr or not curr.next:  # we reached the last node
            # so that curr points to last valid node, whether the prev last was deleted, or this would be a redundant.
            self.curr = prev
</code></pre>
<p>My self.curr still points to the deleted node.</p>
<p>The cases that I missed: correctly marking the self.curr in the cases of last node deletion.</p>
    </div>

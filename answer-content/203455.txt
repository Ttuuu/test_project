<p>I can only add to what Parrish Husband has written:</p>

<p>Consider to rename the sides from "Width" and "Length" to "A" and "B". It will save you a lot of trouble and confusion about which side is Length and which Width (is Length longer than Width or is Width Wider than Length?).</p>

<hr>

<p>Consider to expand Parrish Husbands class hierarchy further: </p>

<pre><code>// base class
public abstract class Shape
{
  public string Name { get; }
  public double Area { get; }
  public double Perimeter { get; }
}

public class Ellipse : Shape
{
}

public class Circle : Ellipse
{
}

public class Polygon : Shape
{
  public int Sides { get; }
}

public class Rectangle : Polygon 
{
  public double A { get; }
  public double B { get; }
}

public class Square : Rectangle 
{
}
</code></pre>

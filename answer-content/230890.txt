<p>As a completion of previous comments:</p>

<pre><code>Main.java
- remove private variable and make local game variable final

DiusBowlingGame.java
- declare gameFrames as List&lt;BowlingFrame&gt; (this is why interfaces were invented :) )

BowlingFrame.java
- create getter and setter for each public field and make them private at declaration time (OOP - incapsulation)

Roll.java
- same as in BowlingFrame.java

<p>A sum of \$n\$ initial natural numbers is
$$1+2+\cdots+n = \frac{n(n+1)}2$$
and a sum of their squares:
$$1^2+2^2+\cdots+n^2=\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}6$$
So these are the expected values of sums for \$n\$â€“item array without duplicates.</p>

<p>Now, if there are two duplicates \$x\$ and \$y\$, the respective sums of values and their squares will become
$$\begin{cases}\sum v = n(n+1)/2 +x + y \\ \sum v^2 = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6 + x^2 + y^2\end{cases}$$</p>

<p>If you find \$y\$ as a function of \$x\$ from the first equation:
$$y=\sum v - n(n+1)/2 - x$$
and plug it into the second one, you'll obtain a quadratic equation with single unknown \$x\$.</p>

<p>So you can just scan the whole array, summing values and their squares, then solve a quadratic equation to obtain \$x\$ and then \$y\$.</p>

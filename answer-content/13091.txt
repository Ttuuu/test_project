<p>The basic idea of all Project Euler problems is to find an efficient solution to the problem, by knowing enough math to simplify the computation your program must do. You can brute-force all of these with enough computing power, but there is a way to reduce the complexity such that a program that solves the problem will give you an answer in under one minute with a 5-year-old computer.</p>

<p>The brute-force answer would be to start at 21 and try every number in order until we found our answer. That's not a great idea, as the answer is quite large, and while, with a powerful computer, you might arrive at the answer in good time, brute force simply won't work in other Project Euler problems (you'll exceed hardware/firmware limitations, or end up with an exponential algorithm taking longer than the estimated heat-death of the universe to compute). In this case, with a few smarts, we can break down the problem and work with smaller numbers, thus taking fewer steps. </p>

<p>You want to know the smallest number divisible by every number from 1 to 20. Well, for one number to be divisible by another, all of the prime factors of the divisor must be present in the prime factorization of the dividend. For instance, 20 is divisible by 10 because 10's factors, 5 and 2, are both present in 20's factorization of 2<sup>2</sup>*5. The quotient is the product of the remaining prime factors; in this case there's only one, 2.</p>

<p>Now, the solution of the problem becomes more apparent; the smallest number divisible by every number from 1 to 20 is the smallest number that contains all the prime factors of every number from 1 to 20. So, the solution is to find the prime factorization of every number from 1 to 20 and keep a count of how many of each prime factor is necessary. Prime factorization is technically an inefficient process (you have to start with the number and divide by every known prime number until you get a whole-number quotient, then repeat from the beginning with that quotient until you're left with 1) but the numbers are so small it doesn't matter.</p>

<p>The solution is the smallest number for which the prime factorization of every number from 1 to 20 is a subset of its own prime factorization. At the least, you'll need one of every prime number from 1 to 20. You will also discover that in order to be divisible by 16, the number must have 4 2s in its prime factorization, and to be divisible by 9 and 18, the number must have 2 3s. The smallest such number is the number that has ONLY the needed factors, so the answer is </p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> 2<sup>4</sup>*3<sup>2</sup>*5*7*11*13*17*19 = 232792560.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The program to find this number will start at 2, iterate to 20, and for each of those numbers it will divide by every known prime less than that number (technically any prime less than the square root of the number but you won't save much that way) to determine their factorization. You will find the numbers that are prime as you go (they won't be divisible by any lesser prime, by definition). Any number that requires more than one of a particular prime factor should be tracked, and the maximum number of each factor remembered (I'll tell you for this problem that only 2 and 3 will require multiples). Then, simply multiply the necessary number of the necessary factors to produce the answer.</p>

<p>If this sounds like a lot, meh; the computer can whip through it pretty quickly, and it will take far less time than counting multiples of 2520. As a point of reference, the correct answer, if you didn't peek, is 5 orders of magnitude greater than this number, requiring about 10,000 iterations * dividing by 20 numbers on each one = 200,000 steps, versus a worst-case of 20 (number of divisors) * 8 (primes less than 20) * 7 / 2 (naive worst case of every number &lt;= 20 being divisible by every prime &lt;=20; not possible but the result's still nowhere close) = 560 steps to find the prime factorizations of the first 20 numbers.</p>

<p>Instead of <code>createMeme()</code> being a void function, you could have it return the created meme, <code>mutableBitmap</code>.<br>
Then, set up your <code>saveMeme</code> function to accept a <code>mutableBitmap</code> as a parameter.</p>

<p>That way, when you want to create AND save, as you originally intended when you created the large function, you might call <code>saveMeme</code> like this: <code>saveMeme(createMeme())</code></p>

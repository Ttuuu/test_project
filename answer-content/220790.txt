<p>Well, if it works for you, it's fine :)</p>

<p>Here are the things that bother me:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Because inserting new objects in Core Data is quite an important operation, and is independent of saving, and since two of your other functions save the context <em>as a side effect</em>, you should change the symbol name <code>save()</code> to something involving <code>insert</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Saving the context as a side effect any time you change any single managed object in any way will probably incur a performance penalty if many objects are changed, for example if pulling from a server, relative to instead saving after all changes are done.</p></li>
<li><p>Your <code>deleteData(forEntity:)</code> function appears to delete only the "last" object returned by a fetch, which is indeterminate unless the fetch request has a sort descriptor, but in your function it does not.  In other words, this function will delete one object of the given entity, but the caller does not know which one.  This is probably not the behavior you were expecting.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That should be enough to get you started.  There may be other issues.</p>

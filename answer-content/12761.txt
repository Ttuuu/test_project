<p>The others have discussed how you aren't quite doing what the problem asks, I'll just look at your code:</p>

<pre><code>def numberlist(nums,limit): 
</code></pre>

<p>When the name of a function has two words it in, we recommend separate it with an _, in this case use <code>number_list</code>. Its easier to understand the name</p>

<pre><code>    sum=0  
</code></pre>

<p><code>sum</code> is the name of a built-in function, you should probably avoid using it</p>

<pre><code>    i=0  
</code></pre>

<p>This does nothing. You don't need to pre-store something in i, just use the for loop</p>

<pre><code>    for i in nums:  
</code></pre>

<p>I really recommend against single letter variable names, it makes code hard to read</p>

<pre><code>        sum=sum+i  
</code></pre>

<p>I'd write this as <code>sum += i</code></p>

<pre><code>        if sum&gt;limit:  
</code></pre>

<p>I'd put space around the <code>&gt;</code> </p>

<pre><code>            return i  
        else:  
            print i
</code></pre>

<p>Your instinct is right, using both <code>return</code> and <code>print</code> is odd. As the others have noted, you shouldn't be printing at all.</p>

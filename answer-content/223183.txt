<p>Your code produces buffer overflows because it doesn't check whether it writes beyond the end of <code>buffer</code>. And it cannot know that because it doesn't know the length of the buffer.</p>

<p>Either the function must have the buffer length as a parameter, or it must clearly document that the buffer must be twice as big as the input string. The latter requirement matches what the current code does but feels wrong because the documentation also says "returns input if the compressed string would be longer". Therefore a saner requirement would be that the buffer is as long as the input, and adjust the code accordingly to never write beyond <code>buffer[strlen(input)]</code>.</p>

<p>By the way, don't trust the CtCI "solutions" from the GitHub repository, they are full of bugs and wrong assumptions. I once filed a few issues there but they have largely been ignored.</p>

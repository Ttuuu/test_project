<h2>What do you think?</h2>

<p>It certainly is <em>clever</em>. That is not always a good thing, because it might be harder to understand what is going on (you have to be at least as clever)</p>

<h2>Is this readable?</h2>

<p>Not really. I can't get from a glance that 100 is treated differently from 400 and why. Also there is no room for comments close to you code.</p>

<p>If you make a set of <code>if</code>s you could do something like:</p>

<pre><code>if (year % 400 ... ) // if 400 then a leap year
{..
..}
</code></pre>

<p>In your IntStream you could do something like:</p>

<pre><code>   IntStream.of(  4,    //yes
                100,    //no
                400     //yes
               )
</code></pre>

<p>But then you kinda miss the 'one-liner' point of your solution.</p>

<h2>Is it efficient?</h2>

<p>Not per se. Most efficient would be to first check divisibility by 400, if true, return true, etc.</p>

<h2>Prime factorization funny fact</h2>

<p>This in incorrect; because it would label 1998 as leap year. Or do you mean something different? </p>

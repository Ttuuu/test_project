<p>Here are just a few observations that may help you improve your code.  In all, it is quite clean and easy to read and understand.</p>

<h2>Use <code>const</code> where practical</h2>

<p>The <code>show()</code> and <code>dump()</code> function don't (and shouldn't) alter the underlying object, so they should be declared <code>const</code>:</p>

<pre><code>void show(std::string const &amp;label, Tower c) const;
void dump() const;
</code></pre>

<h2>Use <code>reserve()</code> to prevent reallocations</h2>

<p>The constructor can easily determine the maximum size of the vectors.  If there were much larger ones than this, one could avoid potentially costly memory reallocations by using <code>Tower.reserve()</code> within the constructor.</p>

<h2>Prefer flexible output</h2>

<p>This is admittedly a very simple program, but generally it's nice to allow for printing to any <code>std::ostream</code> rather than having <code>std::cout</code> hardcoded into the class.  Perhaps it could be a constructor argument.</p>

<h2>Use all required <code>#include</code>s</h2>

<p>The code makes use of <code>std::initializer_list</code> but doesn't have this line:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;initializer_list&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>However,</strong> as @Morwenn points out in a comment, it's not needed to include it explicitly since <code>std::vector</code> must necessarily already include it.</p>

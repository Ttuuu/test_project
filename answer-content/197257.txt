<p>I would strongly consider adding a <code>Comparable</code> abstract class with two implementations (one containing a <code>MyClass1</code>, and the other a <code>MyClass2</code>). At that point you can use all the normal collection framework methods to process this. Alternatively you could transform both sets into something like <code>HashMap&lt;String,HashMap&lt;String,List&lt;MyClassX&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>, then just lookup by the name and id.</p>

<p>Additionally, if the lists are sorted, we could do this much more efficiently, by getting two iterators, then simply getting the next element of the one that is behind at each stage.</p>

<p>In addition to the points already raised:</p>

  <p>The second special case is the "Location:" header. Not only does it send this header back to the browser, but it also returns a <em>REDIRECT</em> (302) status code to the browser unless the <em>201</em> or a <em>3xx</em> status code has already been set.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it's worth asking whether 302 is the most appropriate response code in this case, and I suspect that it would be better to return 301 (Moved Permanently).</p>

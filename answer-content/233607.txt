<p>Something to note: you pass the overall game data into TenPinGame as a string, which you then parse. It would make sense to parse this data first, then instantiate the Game object.</p>

<p>Imagine if you had to add a new feature, which allowed users to input scores from a User Interface. You would then have two "access points", your <em>TenPinGame</em> class should reflect this.</p>

<p>From what I can see, there are three functions relating to input parsing: <em>SplitFramesString</em>, <em>ProcessCharArray</em> and <em>ParseGame</em>. It would make sense to move these three functions into a separate <em>GameInputParser</em>, like so:</p>

<pre><code>public class GameInputParser
{
    public static string[] SplitFramesString(string framesString, int maxFrameNumber) { /*code*/ }

    public static int ProcessCharArray(char characterInString, Frame Frames, int stratingPinsNumber) { /*code*/ }

    internal string ParseGame(string gameInput) { /*code*/ }

} 
</code></pre>
    </div>

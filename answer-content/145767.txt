<p>The biggest issue in your code was inheriting <code>Cat</code> from <code>Dog</code>, and it doesn't make any sense. <code>Dog</code> and <code>Cat</code> classes should be instances from the <code>Animal</code> class, which can inherit every attributes in <code>Animal</code>.</p>

<p>So first, I defined all the attributes in the <code>Animal</code> class. Note that the kind of animal (<code>self.kind</code>) was defined by the name of the instance (<code>self.__class__.__name__</code>), either "Dog", "Cat", or any other name of species when used for inheritance. There are two variables with default value empty ("palce" and "action"), those are further assigned individually based on different instance ("dog" is on the "ground" and "dog" will "woof"). </p>

<pre><code>class Animal:
    place = ''
    action = ''
    def __init__(self, name, gender, breed):
        self.kind = self.__class__.__name__
        self.name = name
        self.gender = gender
        self.breed = breed
    def speak(self, sound):
        self.sound = sound
        print("{} just did a {} {}".format(self.name, self.sound, self.action))
    def getallinfo(self):
        print("{} is a {} {} {}, sitting on the {}".format(self.name, self.gender, self.breed, self.kind, self.place))
#This class inherits kind and place arguments from Animal class (which can work for any animal)
#Initiates a Dog object with name, gender and breed parameters.

class Dog(Animal):
    place = 'Ground'
    action = 'woof'

#Cat class inherits the paramets of use for a Cat (similar things) like name, gender and breed, which they both share, also the getallinfo method and initiate them. 
class Cat(Animal):
    place = 'Ground'
    action = 'meow'


#Here I create 3 objects, 2 dogs and 1 cat with selected arguments.
#And check for some methods on the objects.
Mickey = Dog('Mickey', 'Male', 'Bulldog')
Flora = Dog('Flora','Female','Pug')
Tina = Cat('Tina','Female','Persian')
Tina.getallinfo()
Tina.speak('soft')
Flora.getallinfo()
Mickey.speak('loud')
</code></pre>

<p>This is actually very straightforward, so next time when you need to add another instance to the <code>Animal</code> class, just add the following lines for example and it will do.</p>

<pre><code>class Cow(Animal):
    place = 'Ground'
    action = 'moo'
</code></pre>

<p>put something like this at the beginning of your brute function and you'll see the problem pretty quick.  if i had to guess this is going to take a few centuries to complete.  </p>

<pre><code>std::printf("brute(%d, %d, %s)\n", n, it, join(values).c_str());
</code></pre>

<p>ed: it's actually far worse than i imagined.  on my computer it took 37.4 seconds to get one tick in the 9th cell.  since you need 94 such ticks to budge the 8th cell, it will be 3520 seconds for that.</p>

<p>eventually you get to the 6th cell, which takes 1 year to tick.  you can see now the 5th cell is going to take roughly one century.</p>

<p>689 billion years is a round figure to finish.  </p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestions, I found the most increase in performance came from loading the text of each file into a variable and then doing <code>-match</code> of all needed names in that file. That gave me over 10x improvement in runtime! </p>

<p>Here is final code:</p>

<pre><code>$usedIcons = @()
$searchList = Get-ChildItem -r *.cs

$searchList | ForEach-Object{
    $file = Get-Content $_ -raw
    foreach ($name in $uniqueNames){
        $pattern = "Resources."+$name
        #$pattern = $name
        $found = $file -match $pattern 
        if($found -eq $true){
            Write-Host $name - $_.Name
            $usedIcons += $name
            $uniqueNames = $uniqueNames | Where-Object { $_ -ne $name}
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
    </div>

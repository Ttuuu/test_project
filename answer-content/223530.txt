<p>It seems a main thing you need to learn about is <code>f-strings</code></p>

<p>These are an update to the old <code>format</code> method.</p>

<pre><code>print "Rule " + str (numberofrows)
</code></pre>

<p>becomes</p>

<pre><code>print(f"Rule str(numberofrows)")
</code></pre>

<p>and </p>

<pre><code>"name " + '"{}"'.format(CellContent)
</code></pre>

<p>becomes</p>

<pre><code>f"name {CellContent}"
</code></pre>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong> Python 3 uses () for print statements</p>

<p>It is also worth using a PEP8 checker (such as <code>black</code> - <code>pip install black</code>) to make your code more readable </p>

<hr>

<p>You could also change things like</p>

<pre><code>s=s+1
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>s += 1
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Rather than saying </p>

<pre><code>anycells = ["any","Any", "ANY"]  
if str(x[0]) in anycells
...
</code></pre>

<p>You could say</p>

<pre><code>if str(x[0]).lower() == "any"
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Are you sure this is your code?
This looks very much like Python 2 code which hasn't been used for over 6 years. I am curious why you would write something in Python 2 still? It seems odd to learn Python 2 as a new beginner</p>

<p>The things to consider when it comes to <code>async</code> event handlers are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Exceptions thrown for the handler might be rethrown on the UI <code>SynchronizationContext</code>, which usually crashes the application.</li>
<li>After you raise the event, the handlers won't be completed yet. The execution of a handler might be interleaved with the execution of the code after the raising and execution of multiple handlers can also be interleaved with each other.</li>
</ul>

<p>Assuming those caveats are acceptable for you, code like this should be fine.</p>

<hr>

<p>Also:</p>

<pre><code>view.OnRefreshObjectExplorerClicked += new EventHandler(async (s, e) =&gt; await RefreshObjectExplorerAsync());
</code></pre>

<p>You should be able to simplify this to just:</p>

<pre><code>view.OnRefreshObjectExplorerClicked += async (s, e) =&gt; await RefreshObjectExplorerAsync();
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>It seems you never unsubscribe the event handlers, are you sure that's okay?</p>

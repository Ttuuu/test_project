<p>Welcome to CodeReview! Especially as a beginner programmer, it takes bravery to show your code to the internet, but you've taken the first step.</p>

<p>This code has a long way to go, but I think it'll be a good learning experience for you.</p>

<pre><code>//declares variables
</code></pre>

<p>Keep in mind that this isn't 1989-era C, so you don't need to predeclare all of your variables at the top of methods. Declare them where they're actually used.</p>

<pre><code>String[] sentence = new String [23];
</code></pre>

<p>What is the number 23? This is a so-called magic number. If it really needs to be in the program, it should be put in its own named constant. However, I suspect that this is the number of lines of input. First: you already have logic to quit once you find the end of the file. Also: why store every line? You only need to store the results of letter summation, not the raw input. So this array is not necessary.</p>

<pre><code>inputStream = new Scanner(new File(filename)); 
</code></pre>

<p>Google "try-with-resources". This will make it so that your program will close the file even if something goes wrong in the middle.</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; sentence.length; i++) 
</code></pre>

<p>This loop can go away entirely. The <code>while</code> above it already iterates through the lines of the file.</p>

<pre><code>int countA = 0;
</code></pre>

<p>You should not have each of these as individual values. You arrived at the right idea later on with the <code>count</code> array. All of those individual letter count variables should go away and you should operate on the array directly.</p>

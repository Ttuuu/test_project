<p>Is the graphic representation of a data structure an integral part of that data structure (<code>val gString = myGrid.asText</code>) or separate and independent from the data structure (<code>val gString = asText(myGrid)</code>)?</p>

<p>I tend to favor the former, but if the <code>Grid</code> API is solid and supplies everything needed for one or more graphic representations, then the latter is probably the better choice. It's a little hard to judge here as you haven't provided the <code>Grid</code> (or <code>Piece</code>) code.</p>

<p>I question the choice of iterating through coordinates that <em>are known</em> to be outside the <code>Grid</code> just for the purpose of drawing a border. Wouldn't it be easier to get the grid contents and simply "wrap" them with border characters?</p>

<pre><code>def asText(grid :Grid) :String = {
  val border = "|" + "-"*grid.x + "|"
  (1 to grid.y).map{ y =&gt;
    (1 to grid.x).map{ x =&gt;
      if      (grid.pieces.contains(Piece("X", x, y))) "X"
      else if (grid.pieces.contains(Piece("O", x, y))) "O"
      else "."
    }.mkString("|", "", "|")
  }.mkString(s"$border\n", "\n", s"\n$border")
}
</code></pre>

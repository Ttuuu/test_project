<p>These following rules are pretty general and take time to internalize. I hope you can apply some of them to your code anyways.</p>

<p>Global variables (variables you don't declare in functions, but at the top level) should be avoided). Constants (variables which you never change) are okay. Instead of changing/mutating global variables in your functions, try to rewrite them so they take input and return something. </p>

<p>Try to break your code up into more functions.</p>

<p>Give descriptive variable names (What does "t" do in your code?).</p>

<p>Read through PEP8(<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/</a>) and try to apply it to your code.</p>

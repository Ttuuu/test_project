<p>The only way to quickly get the last index is to store this index after each write operation. Other approaches will not, quote, "pull as much performance as possible".</p>

<p>I have a feeling that this problem you are having is a symptom of a much larger design issue. In general you should be able to just pick a correct data type, in this case it's <code>MemoryStream</code>, and work with that. You don't have to come up with your own ill-thought-out implementation.</p>

<pre><code>var ms = new MemoryStream(new byte[4096]);
ms.Write(....);
ms.Write(....);
var lastIndex = ms.Length - 1;
</code></pre>

<p>For multi-threading scenarios you can segment your array using <code>MemoryStream(byte[], int, int)</code> constructor or <code>ArraySegment&lt;T&gt;</code> class. Both are cheap.</p>

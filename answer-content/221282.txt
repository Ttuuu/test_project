<p>Refactoring is commonly seen as "moving out repeating code into reusable functions". But it can also easily mean "moving code that's only ever used once back to where it's being used". Although the book led you to writing individual functions, you don't have to split all this code up.</p>

<p>Also, if you're just turning a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeList" rel="noreferrer"><code>NodeList</code></a> into an array just to use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach" rel="noreferrer"><code>array.forEach()</code></a>, then this conversion is unnecessary. <code>NodeList</code> already comes with a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeList/forEach" rel="noreferrer"><code>forEach</code></a> method (unless you still care about IE).</p>

<p>Your code could be as short as:</p>

<pre><code>document.querySelectorAll('a').forEach(link =&gt; {
  link.addEventListener('click', event =&gt; event.preventDefault())
})
</code></pre>

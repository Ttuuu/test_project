<p>Your idea to transform the table so that the implied keys explicitly appear on every row is an interesting one, but I think that it is overcomplicated.</p>

<p>The backslashes to indicate continuation lines are actually superfluous here, since an unfinished <code>$(</code> substitution automatically causes the command to be incomplete.  Similarly, ending a line with a <code>|</code> pipe would also cause the command to be continued, so that would be a better convention to follow than putting the <code>|</code> at the beginning of the following line.</p>

<p>In general, any combination of <code>sed</code>, <code>awk</code>, and <code>grep</code> would be better expressed using just an AWK script.  The AWK script below reads a key and value if there is a colon on a line, or just a value if there is no colon.</p>

<pre><code>SECRET_NAME=$(
    oc describe sa sa-build-webhook-realworld |
    awk -F: '
        $2  { KEY=$1 ; VALUE=$2; sub("^ *", "", VALUE); }
        !$2 {          VALUE=$1; sub("^ *", "", VALUE); }
        KEY=="Mountable secrets" &amp;&amp; VALUE !~ /docker/ { print VALUE }
    '
)
</code></pre>

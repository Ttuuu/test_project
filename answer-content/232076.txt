<p>Here is my contribution.</p>

<p>You should not make the while True loop, instead of that you should use <strong>inotify</strong> in order to been notify only when changes happen on the file that you are monitoring, here is a short code.</p>

<pre><code>import inotify.adapters

def _read_log(self):
    i = inotify.adapters.Inotify()

    i.add_watch(f)

    with open(f, 'w'):
        pass

    for event in i.event_gen(yield_nones=False):
        (_, type_names, path, filename) = event

        do_work()
</code></pre>

<p>Basically your process will be only unblock until there are some changes on the file that you are monitoring. </p>

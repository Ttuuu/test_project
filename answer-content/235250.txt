<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>A function able to set the column number according to the column header would be the next one. Please replace ActiveSheet from the <code>Track</code> worksheet definition</p>

<pre><code>Private Function HdN(strHead As String) As Long
  Dim hdArr As Variant, Track As Worksheet, i As Long, lastCol As Long
  Set Track = ActiveSheet 'Attention! define here your real sheet. I used it for testing
  lastCol = Track.Cells(1, Track.Columns.count).End(xlToLeft).Column
  hdArr = Track.Range("A1:" &amp; Cells(1, lastCol).Address).Value
  HdN = Application.WorksheetFunction.Match(strHead, hdArr, 0)
End Function
</code></pre>

<p>It can be used in the next way:</p>

<p>Instead of <code>Track.Cells(LastRow + 1, "C")</code> you can use <code>Track.Cells(LastRow + 1, HdN("Delivery Date"))</code>.
If the actual column will be cut and inserted in a different place, it can be identified.</p>

<p>You don't pass <code>N</code> to <code>diagonal_difference</code>, that's bad practice. You should either be passing it as a parameter, or at least determining it within the function since it's just <code>len(matrix)</code>. Also <code>N</code> isn't a good name, just because the question used that doesn't mean you need to. Code has different requirements than a brief. Maybe <code>matrix_size</code> or some other explicit name.</p>

<p>It's also odd to have <code>raw_input()</code> when you're actually expecting input. Putting at least <code>"&gt;"</code> is recommended so that the user can see that the script is waiting for input, not just running code silently.</p>

<p>For some reason I can't open the link to the question site. But "Returns [X] if given phrase is one of the following inputs", to me, does not mean it only returns that for that inputs.
It also doesn't say you should return <code>nil</code> otherwise.</p>

<p>If we take the listed inputs to be test cases; then baking them in the implementation is not good.</p>

<p>I understand the cases to be as such:
- blank (nothing but whitespace)
- question (ends with <code>\?</code>, as hinted in example)
- shouting (all letters are uppercase)
- anyhing else</p>

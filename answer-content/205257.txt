<p>The program is running in quadratic time. As usual, to improve performance you need to change the algorithm.</p>

<p>Sort the numbers into 32 buckets, according to where the most significant bit of the number is. Convince yourself that if a bucket contains more than one number, it makes no sense to test them against the numbers from other buckets (the result is guaranteed to not be minimal). A cross-bucket xor should be tested only if two adjacent buckets contain just one number each.</p>

<p>Work recursively with each bucket.</p>

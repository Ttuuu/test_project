<p>Your code looks good however, I have few suggestions.</p>

<pre><code>private String OnlyAlphabets
</code></pre>

<p>the convention is to use camel case for method names, so it should be</p>

<pre><code>private String onlyAlphabets
</code></pre>

<p>Although this is your sample program however, if such small utilities are required throughout the application then make them static and public. This will allow ease of access and since such utility does not modify the state of object so it is better to make them static.</p>

<pre><code>public static String onlyAlphabets
</code></pre>

<p>Always check of null before doing further operations on your input string</p>

<pre><code>if (Objects.isNull(string))
            return string;
</code></pre>

<p>If you are using java-8 or above then streams will surely make your code more compact with the below statement</p>

<pre><code>return string.codePoints()
             .filter(Character::isAlphabetic)
             .collect(StringBuilder::new, 
                      StringBuilder::appendCodePoint, 
                      StringBuilder::append)
             .toString();
</code></pre>

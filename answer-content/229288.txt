<p>I really don't recommend trying to write anything that is more complicated than necessary during an interview, especially if it's on a whiteboard. Interviews are stressful enough for you; introducing more opportunities for errors is not a good idea. As for the interviewer, their likely thoughts are that your code lacks elegance and is hard to verify.</p>

<pre><code>    if insert &lt; yet_max:
TypeError: '&lt;' not supported between instances of 'int' and 'NoneType' <span class="math-container">`</span>
</code></pre>

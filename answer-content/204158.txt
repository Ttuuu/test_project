<p>Another way to fill the array is to first ensure it is initialized <em>outside any for-loop</em> to contain only blank tiles, and then to just add the border. For example:</p>

<pre><code>int rpgLevelGrid[dim][dim] = {}; // Initialize with all-zeroes

for (int i = 0; i &lt; dim; i++) {
  rpgLevelGrid[i][0] = 1;
  rpgLevelGrid[i][dim - 1] = 1;
  rpgLevelGrid[0][i] = 1;
  rpgLevelGrid[dim - 1][i] = 1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The above code does not contain any conditional statements, and this generally makes code faster. It can be improved further by splitting the for loop into multiple loops for the top row, middle section and bottom row, so that memory is written to sequentially, and to avoid writing to the four corner tiles twice.</p>

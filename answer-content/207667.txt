<h3>Your style of testing</h3>

<p>I myself was using your style for a long time... until after several weeks I couldn't make any sense of them anymore. They are testing something, yes, but what and why? Nobody could say that anymore and especially when I wanted to know whether I tested a particular feature there was no way I could tell that.</p>

<p>Your client/customer/someone will tell you that something doesn't work... but all you see are properties and methods... now try to connect this with the broken feature. </p>

<h3>BDD style</h3>

<p><em>(This is my favourite.)</em></p>

<p>The <code>BDD</code> style on the contrary clearly shows you what you are testing so even after a couple of weeks you'll still be able to understand them. You don't want to know the input data from the test name. You want to take a quick look at the list and be able to tell what your code is capabale of.</p>

<p>You don't what to know the APIs you are testing from the test name. This doesn't help. They might seem obvious now when everything is fresh but in a couple of weeks you'll forget the most of it (if you're working on several projects). The only thing you'll be able to identify are the features and if you cannot find them quickly, you'll end up debugging your code and studying it from the beginning. This is a pain... </p>

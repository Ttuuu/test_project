<ul>
<li>in the <code>Memory</code> c'tor, use the member initialization list to initialize <code>mem_ptr_</code></li>
<li>in <code>check_adr</code> you can skip the check for <code>adr &lt; 0</code></li>
<li><p>Chip8.h doesn't make use of it's included headers. I'd move them to another file. I suspect <code>&lt;iostream&gt;</code> is used by the logger, why not putting the include there and save compilation units that don't require iostream from the effort including the header.</p></li>
<li><p>in <code>read_short</code> you're calculating <code>ram_[adr+1] &amp; 0xFF00</code>, which is <code>0</code> as <code>ram_[]</code> is <code>uint8_t</code></p></li>
<li>check which functions don't modify the internal state of <code>Memory</code> and make them <code>const</code>, e.g. <code>get_memory_pointer</code> or <code>read_byte</code>.</li>
</ul>

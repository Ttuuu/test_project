<p>One improvement I suggest is that in the beginning of your code, you could create a list of sets, in which each set would be a winning board configuration and then create two sets to record the players moves, like this: </p>

<pre><code>winningMoves = [{1,2,3}, {1,4,7}, {1,5,9}, {7,5,3}, {7,8,9}, {3,6,9}, {4, 5, 6}, {2, 5, 8}]
playerOneMoves = set()
playerTwoMoves = set()
</code></pre>

<p>In the part that you check which player made the move, you would insert an "add(toPlay)" for both players, like this:</p>

<pre><code>if playerTurn == 1:
    toDraw[toPlay -1] = "X"
    playerOneMoves.add(toPlay)
    turnsPlayed += 1
    playerTurn = 2
</code></pre>

<p>If I'm right, if you make things like this, you could reduce that great amount of code in checkIfWin() function to just:</p>

<pre><code>def checkIfWin():  # 0 - Game in progress; 1 - Player 1 wins; 2 - Player 2 wins

    for move in winningMoves:
        if move.issubset(playerOneMoves):
            return 1
        elif move.issubset(playerTwoMoves):
            return 2
    return 0
</code></pre>

<p>The issubset() method will return True if move is a subset of the set that contains the player's moves. Which means it will return True if all elements in move are also in playerOneMoves or playerTwoMoves.</p>

<p>Also, instead of printing the board with format, you could develop a way of printing each part of the board individually inside a loop, for example:</p>

<pre><code>for num in range(1,10):

    if num in list(playerOneMoves):
        print("[{}]".format('X'), end = '')
    elif num in list(playerTwoMoves):
        print("[{}]".format('O'), end = '')
    else:
        print("[{}]".format(num), end = '')
    if num%3 ==0:
        print("")
</code></pre>

<p>(Of course you could improve the style!)</p>

<p>The reason for that is that it would allow you to suppress toDraw completely and simplify your code even more. </p>

<p>I don't program in Python but this is a pretty simple problem to solve.
Here is the code then I will break it down for you</p>

<pre><code>for i in range(0, 10):
     if i != 5:
          print (i*5)
</code></pre>

<p>So let's go over this. The first line is a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_for_loops.asp" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>for</code> loop</a>. This kind of loop is kinda like the <code>while</code> loop but it creates and increments the variable for you and has a harder chance of going infinite. The <code>range()</code> part of that line is just saying to start <code>i</code> at 0 and to increment it by 1 until it reaches 10.</p>

<p>The next line is just checking if <code>i == 5</code> and if so, it will not print that result.</p>

<p>The final line just prints <code>i*5</code> if <code>i</code> is not 5.</p>

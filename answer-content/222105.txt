<p>There is no need for a return statement here because when you reach the end of a function, there is an implicit return.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>1 def exampleFunction():
2   if someCondition:
3     doThis()
4   else:
5     doTheOtherThing()
6
</code></pre>

<p>We could put a return statement after the call to <code>doThis()</code>, but this would make no difference to the execution of the code. When <code>someCondition</code> is <code>True</code>, we enter that code block and then call <code>doThis()</code>. Then, we go to line 6 and implicitly return from the function.</p>

<p>So after executing line 3, we jump to line 6 and implicitly return, so explicitly returning after line 3 makes no difference.</p>

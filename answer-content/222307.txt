<p>As @Peilonrayz said - your code is well built and according to me, unexpectedly short which is certainly a good job as most people tend to write long programs for short tasks like this.</p>

<hr>

<p>But you could make it much shorter (a single line perhaps) -</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print('\n'.join(map(''.join, zip(*grid))))

..OO.OO..
.OOOOOOO.
.OOOOOOO.
..OOOOO..
...OOO...
....O....
</code></pre>

<p>The <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/zip-in-python/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>zip</code></a><code>(*grid)</code> effectively transposes the matrix (flip it on the main diagonal), then each row is <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/join-function-python/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>joined</code></a> into one string, then the rows are joined with newlines so the whole thing can be printed at once.</p>

<p>Here's what <code>map()</code> in Python is -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The <strong><code>map()</code></strong> function returns a list of the results after applying the given
  function to each item of a given iterable (list, tuple, etc.)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><sup><sup>Source - <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-map-function/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-map-function/</a></sup></sup></p>

<p><strong><em>BUT</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em><code>map()</code></em></strong> is a built-in function which focuses on functional programming. It may be useful for hacks and tricks since it shortens the code, but can be a bad idea for large projects in use.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>I suggest you to use resource based locking. Consider the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>your application uses well known TCP/UDP port. Only single process can bind it.</li>
<li>your application uses some configuration/database/whatever files in predefined places. <code>flock</code> them. Same stands for pid files under <code>/var/run</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is still possible to separate resources with chroot or containers. But if nothing is shared are there any benefits in <em>forced locking</em>?</p>

<p>I guess mid-average users won't use network namespaces, chroots or containers. If they will - I bet they have <em>the reasones</em> so let them do the thing.</p>

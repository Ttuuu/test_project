<p>There are a few things I would like to point out to you.</p>

<h2>Style</h2>

<p>Python has an official style guide called PEP8. Under "Indendation" there is the following rule most Python programmers stick to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use 4 spaces per indentation level.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reference: <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#indentation" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP8 - Indentation</a></p>

<p>This would also make your code consistent with the provided test code.</p>

<p>Though not strictly part of PEP8, most of the tools integrated in Python IDEs would also tell you that <code>s</code> is not a good variable name. Use something that is more descriptive (<code>n_paths</code> maybe?).</p>

<p>While we're at it, you can wrap long lines such as the sum of the four traverse calls on multiple lines to allow better readability in case you have, say two documents next to each other or a small screen. Including the previous note, <code>s = ...</code> could be transformed into, e.g.</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>n_paths = traverse(row, col + 1) \
    + traverse(row + 1, col) \
    + traverse(row - 1, col) \
    + traverse(row, col - 1)
</code></pre>

<h2>The <code>nonlocal</code> keyword</h2>

<p>I suspect you slightly missunderstood what <code>nonlocal</code> does. All variables from an outer scope are automatically available to <em>read from</em> in nested scopes. This means in your case, <code>traverse</code> can see <code>num_of_rows</code> and <code>num_of_cols</code> from <code>robot_paths</code> automatically.</p>

<p>Statements like <code>nonlocal</code> or <code>global</code> only come into play whenever you want to <em>assign to</em> a variable not in your local scope. The Python interpreter would then recognize, that you don't want to create a new local variable with the given name, but instead use an already existing one from an outer scope. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1261961">This</a> SO answer has a nice example to show you that effect.</p>

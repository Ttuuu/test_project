<p>A couple points here, first you should always use curly braces <code>{</code> <code>}</code>, even when the code to be executed is 1 line long.</p>

<p>More importantly, you potentially have an infinite loop. Even if you had more than 2 values to choose from, this is a bad approach. A better idea is <code>greaterThan = greaterThan == 'y' ? 'n' : 'y';</code>.</p>

<pre><code>while (greaterThan == lessThan)
    greaterThan = std::rand() % 2 == 0 ? 'y' : 'n';
</code></pre>
    </div>

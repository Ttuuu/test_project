<p>Of course, it's bad mojo to use predefined key words as variable names, and yes, this might bring you into trouble. </p>

<p>About "key": key is only defined for skip lists (perm: <code>_x key (Skip)</code>) and for the internal perm <code>HttpHeaderEntryString_ key ()</code>. It is not possible to cast a Skip list to a string, the code <code>Skip sk = create(); string s = "hello " sk "!"</code> will not be valid, so there is almost no danger that the interpreter wants to make a string concatenation when you have the code <code>xx = key sk</code>, even when key is defined as a string variable. </p>

<p>So, in this case, you are more or less safe.<code>string key key2 key3</code> will give you a plain old syntax error that you can easily detect.</p>

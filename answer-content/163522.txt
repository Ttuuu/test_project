<p>It works that's for sure. </p>

<p>But enums could just as easily be defined in the database. Now that you've already got it working with enums, I would say stick with enums untill you have a good reason to change it.</p>

<p>anyways, here's how i probably would have done it: </p>

<p>e.g.</p>

<ul>
<li>user has_many subscription_plans</li>
<li>subscription_plan can belong to many users.</li>
<li>Limit the ability for a user to have a max of two, one of each type. Or the user must have two at any one time etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>You get the picture. You can change the subscription plan table to suit your needs.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

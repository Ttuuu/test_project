<p>You'll have to test all this, but:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your editor highlighting will guide you. When I pulled out your functions, I found a need to add <code>this</code> and <code>courtComp</code> as <code>arguments</code> to <code>proceed</code> and <code>courtComp</code> to <code>record</code>, but at least I could retire a <code>nonlocal</code>. I also found, going through your code, that some variables can be retired altogether.</li>
<li>You can define a few more functions to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" rel="nofollow noreferrer">DRY</a> your code, e.g.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>def ensure_dir(dir):
    if not os.path.exists(dir): os.mkdir(dir)</code></p>

<p>and</p>

<p><code>def wait_():
    select = Select(driver.find_element_by_css_selector('#sateist'))
    select.select_by_visible_text('Maharashtra')
    for s in ['.region', '#sateist']:
        wait.until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CSS_SELECTOR, s)))</code></p>

<p>This also lets you retire some variable declarations.</p>

<ul>
<li>To flatten (denest) your code further, put the shorter of two if/else options first, then the rest may not need the else. For example, <code>if headingDist.text.lower() == distName.lower():</code> enters lots of code even after we pull out functions defined in it, but is followed by an <code>else:</code> that only enters two lines. The large number in that first block can each be unindented one level if you follow my advice.</li>
<li>If a block's more than a few lines, it's worth turning that into a function too for further denesting.</li>
<li>You should probably learn how to make code more Pythonic. For example, instead of saying <code>i=1</code> and doing a while loop ending in <code>i += 1</code>, <a href="https://snakify.org/en/lessons/for_loop_range/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">use a for loop with <code>range</code></a>. (It doesn't make a big difference in a long block, but that's kind of the point: the blocks will quickly become short with the above points.) You might also want to learn about <a href="https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">f-strings</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>None of this advice is intended to make it faster, but better understanding Selenium might.</p>

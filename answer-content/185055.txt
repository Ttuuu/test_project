<p>Yes, this is a nice, clean way to do it. I do not see smth wrong here. You have your helper methods isolated, they are exposed correctly, and the methods within are DRY, they only care for what they get from arguments, and they return one thing only.</p>

<p>Maybe you have to get sure that nothing breaks if <code>init()</code> gets called for more than one times, that is the one thing I would suggest.</p>

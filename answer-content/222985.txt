<p>There is a slight difference in the order of evaluation, in that the book's solution recurses before calling <code>consp</code>, whereas your solution recurses after calling <code>consp</code>. Either way, the recursion happens before concatenation, because the innermost expressions in <code>(append (apply #'list-of elt) (uncompress (cdr lst)))</code> and <code>(cons elt (uncompress (cdr lst)))))))</code> have to be evaluated first.</p>

<p>I think that your solution is a bit worse than the book's, in that the common expression <code>(uncompress (cdr lst))</code> is written twice.</p>

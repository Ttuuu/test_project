<p>Do I need atomic? I have only one thread, can I use just thread::joinable() instead?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you only use an instance of <code>struct X</code> from one thread, then you could indeed use <code>thread::joinable()</code> to check whether the save thread is running. However, as soon as you have multiple threads accessing an <code>X</code>, then you need atomics, otherwise two threads can simultaneously check <code>thread::joinable()</code>, both get <code>false</code>, and then both will start a new <code>saveThread</code> simultaneously.</p>
<p>The atomic flag doesn't help you with thread safety in any way. It only ensures atomic modification of the flag itself.</p>

<p>Anything else I am missing?</p>

<p>I can't tell, because you've just shown a prototype, and you haven't said what properties (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ACID</a>) your database has. Most serious databases use some form of
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_log" rel="nofollow noreferrer">transaction log</a>, which is appended to for every operation on the database, they don't just rely on periodic saving of the data.</p>

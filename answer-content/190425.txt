<p>Your code is quite good for someone who started 10 days ago. Here are a couple of improvements you should consider:</p>

<ol>
<li>Your code is hard to read due to inadequate indentation and spacing. Take a look <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style#K&amp;R_style" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> for the recommended indentation style for C++.</li>
<li><code>using namespace std;</code> is fine for simple programs like this, but it's a good idea to break out of the habit of using it. It is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1452721/why-is-using-namespace-std-considered-bad-practice">considered bad practice</a>.</li>
<li>It is advisable to keep in mind the possibility of the functionality of a program to be expanded in the future, even if that seems unlikely in the present. For instance, your current code is for a 4x4 tic-tac-toe. If you were to change this in the future to a 3x3 or 5x5 tic-tac-toe, you would need to replacing all <code>4</code>'s in the code to the new dimension. You are currently using a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47882/what-is-a-magic-number-and-why-is-it-bad">magic number</a> and it would be a good idea to declare a <code>const int</code> with the board dimension.</li>
<li>In <code>setPosition()</code>, you have a <code>while(1)</code> loop which you terminate with <code>break</code>. Using <code>break</code> in this manner is <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/58253/157676">considered bad practice</a>. Try using a <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/do" rel="nofollow noreferrer">do-while loop</a>, where the test takes place after each iteration, in order to solve the problem.</li>
<li>You have several methods of type <code>int</code> that return <code>0</code> or <code>1</code> depending on whether a condition is true or false. I suggest using the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bool-data-type-in-c/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>bool</code> data type</a> as the return type of these methods, since that's what it was made for.</li>
<li>Having 4 similar methods (<code>checkHorizontal()</code>, <code>checkVertical()</code>, <code>checkprincipalDiagonal()</code> and <code>checkotherDiagonal()</code>) is unnecessary since their functionality can be combined into 1 method. Try to think of how you can use 1 method with 1 nested loop to conduct all the checks. </li>
<li>Also note that the names <code>checkprincipalDiagonal()</code> and <code>checkotherDiagonal()</code> do not use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case" rel="nofollow noreferrer">proper camelCase</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>This should set you off in the right direction, happy coding!</p>

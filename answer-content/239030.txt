<p>You could potentially use incremental computation (think Excel cells that cache values).</p>

<p>Some details (in F#) here:

<p>The above is ported from the Incremental portion of the Aardvark project:

<p>The documentation is all F# since this model works well in a functional style, but it works similarly well in imperative (and is interoperable with C#)

<p>These do pretty much exactly what you want, with automatic dependency tracking and lazy value updating (on read).</p>

<p>There are some utility classes for interop with C# as well, and they work decently - but you still end up having to do some manual messy F# interop on occasion.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the documentation is also a bit lacking, so reading code is often also necessary if you want to do more than the basics, but it's a quite powerful model.</p>

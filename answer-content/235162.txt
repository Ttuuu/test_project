<p>I think overall, it looks quite good. Some polishing is needed before you submit to CRAN (e.g. you didn't update the <code>Title</code> and <code>Description</code> fields in your <code>DESCRIPTION</code>). Below are also specific points you might want to consider.</p>

<h2>Structure of your specific project</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>In terms of structure, I don't really understand the need of having two separate functions for checking coverage for a single point and for multiple points. I know the API has two different URLs for this but surely, it would be simpler for users if they have a single function that works no matter if they provide one or multiple points. Or am I missing something here?</p></li>
<li><p>Currently, if the user didn't register an API key, they get a cryptic error message (<code>Forbidden (HTTP 403)</code>). It might be better to check if <code>api_token</code> is empty and return a more specific error message.</p></li>
<li><p>You seem to import a lot of packages and functions that (as I far as I can tell) you're not using. If this is actually the case, it might be good to remove them from your dependency list.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>General package structure comments</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Add a <code>BugReports</code> field to your <code>DESCRIPTION</code> to guide users to the appropriate place to report issues and contribute patches.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/licenses/MIT" rel="nofollow noreferrer">According to CRAN</a>, your <code>LICENSE</code> file should only contain two lines with your name and the year, not the full license text.</p></li>
<li><p>You have non-standard files in your package root, namely <code>circle.yml</code> (should be add to <code>.Rbuildignore</code>) and <code>citymappR_logo.png</code> (<a href="https://github.com/ropensci/rotemplate/issues/19#issuecomment-506315565" rel="nofollow noreferrer">should be moved to <code>man/figures</code></a>).</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Specific points relevant to API packages:</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://httr.r-lib.org/articles/api-packages.html#set-a-user-agent" rel="nofollow noreferrer">It is good practice to set a custom user agent for API package</a>, including your contact, so that API developers know where the requests come from and can reach you if necessary.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Optional:</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/rd-formatting.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Your roxygen comments can use the markdown syntax</a> if you like. Personally I prefer it as I find it more readable in its unparsed state but it's not an obligation and it's up to you.</li>
</ul>

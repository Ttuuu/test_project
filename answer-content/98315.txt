<p>To be fair, a null can't really be sorted within a group of sortable objects. You'll end up with the nulls beside each other every time, where they lay is the question. I take it you wanted to sort the array WITHOUT looking at nulls? i.e.</p>

<p><code>1, null, null, 10, 1, null, 73, 5</code></p>

<p>should become</p>

<p><code>1, null, null, 1, 5, null, 10, 73</code></p>

<p>Is this what you want?</p>

<p>Edit: Woops I mistook this post for Java. Does Javascript offer a comparator interface or implementation? I suggest you look towards making your own sort algorithm to sort how you want, but excluding any comparisons on a proper <code>int</code> versus <code>null</code>.</p>

<h3>Review</h3>

  <p><em>I should check for the list having no elements anyway, so I could check for its having only 1 element and return that element</em></p>

<ul>
<li>You have implemented a simple function, so it shouldn't have been that hard to provide a couple of unit tests. You would have immediately found bugs on the most obvious edge cases as (1) empty list and self-created edge case (2) single item.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>While insignificant in terms of wasted time and resources, I just
  find it lacking elegance.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>What you gain in elegance is lost by the edge case guards you'd have to build in to fix the bugs.</li>
</ul>

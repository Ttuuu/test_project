<p>I see a few things that might be changed.  </p>

<h2><code>mp_init</code></h2>

<p>First, consider checking the passed <code>*mp</code> variable to see if it's <code>NULL</code> at least within the <code>mp_init</code> call.  Alternatively, you could also allocate that structure within the <code>mp_init</code> routine and return a pointer to it or <code>NULL</code> on error.</p>

<p>The initialization is more complex than it needs to be. Rather than make repeated calls to <code>mp_release</code> and do all of that pointer manipulation, you could use this:</p>

<pre><code>char *ptr;
for (ptr = mp-&gt;memory; --slots; ptr+=size) 
    *(void **)ptr = ptr+size;
*(void **)ptr = NULL;
mp-&gt;head = mp-&gt;memory;
</code></pre>

<h2><code>mp_release</code></h2>

<p>Within <code>mp_release</code>, there is no error checking.  This might be OK if we're looking for extreme performance, but it might be nice to have at least a debug version that checks that <code>mem</code> actually points to a slot.  For that to work, of course, you'll have to add at least one more variable to the structure to contain the <code>size</code> parameter.</p>

<h2><code>mp_destroy</code></h2>

<p>In <code>mp_destroy</code> it might be prudent to set <code>mp-&gt;head = NULL</code> so that any subsequent <code>mp_get</code> attempts will fail.</p>

<li><p>I think that <code>static_assert((CHAR_BIT &amp; (CHAR_BIT - 1)) == 0</code> can be pretty safely replaced by <code>CHAR_BIT==8</code>. There are various old DSP compilers that would fail the test, but they are indeed dinosaur systems.</p>
</li>
<li><p>stdint.h and constants like <code>SIZE_MAX</code>, <code>PTRDIFF_MAX</code> were added in C99. So by using such macros/constants, you'll essentially cause all C90 compilers to fail compilation.</p>
<p>Are C90 compilers dinosaurs per your definition? If not, then maybe
do some checks if <code>__STDC_VERSION__</code> is defined and if so what
version. Because most of the exotic ones are likely to follow C90.</p>

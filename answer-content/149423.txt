<p>Since you asked for a Pythonic solution and I see none so far, I propose:</p>

<pre><code>new_L = [sum(L[:i+1]) for i in range(len(L))]
</code></pre>

<p>It's certainly less efficient than an accumulator -- it's \$O(\frac{n^2}{2})\$ vs \$O(n)\$ -- but it uses a list comprehension as you suggested.</p>

<p>You don't validate your input.  If the user enters a string with no space in it, you'll get an exception.</p>

<p><code>s[0]</code> is a character, so why do you convert it to a string to convert it back to a character?</p>

<p>You should avoid allocating <code>_trieArray</code> until you need it.  Otherwise you'll allocate a bunch of memory you don't use (in all your leaf nodes).</p>

<p>You don't need to use <code>_findCount</code>.  Your private <code>find</code> method can just return that value.</p>

<p>As an additional exercise, rewrite <code>add</code> to not be recursive, and avoid making all those (sub)string copies.</p>

<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>Your calculation of <code>count</code> is incorrect in two ways:
 1. You don't count your last guess;
 2. You count invalid user input.</p>

<p>I would separate the input validation from the input processing. And I would add some logic to handle user input that leads to trying the same guess repetitively, for this the user has to lie, but who guarantees us they won't? </p>

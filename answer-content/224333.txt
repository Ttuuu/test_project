<p>First I suggest you to split your logic into several function, it will help you to see what is essential and what you could optimize / remove. </p>

<pre><code>import random
print("Rock, Paper, Scissors")

AVAILABLE_CHOICES = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']


def rps():
  try:
    userInput = getUserInput()
    computerChoice = getComputerChoise()
    result = getResult()
    tryAgainMaybe()
  except Exception as err:
    print(err)


  def getUserInput() :
    userInput = input("Please enter your choice: ")
    userInput = userInput.lower()
    if userInput not in AVAILABLE_CHOICES:
        raise Exception('Your choice is invalid')
    return userInput;

  def getComputerChoice():
    return random.choice(AVAILABLE_CHOICES);

  def getResult():
    result = ''

    if userInput == computerChoice:
      result = "DRAW!"
    elif userInput == 'rock'     and computerChoice == 'scissors' or \
         userInput == 'paper'    and computerChoice == 'rock' or \
         userInput == 'scissors' and computerChoice == 'paper':
        result = 'USER WINS!'
    else:
        result = "COMPUTER WINS!"
    return result

  def tryAgainMaybe():
    print("Would you like to try again?")
    try_again = input("Y/N  ")
    try_again = try_again.lower()
    if try_again == "y":
        print("\n")
        rps()
    else:
        print("\n")
        print("Thank you for using my Rock, Paper, Scissors Program")

<ol>
<li><p>Create a list of available choices instead of writing them everywhere. it will be easier to modify and to test for your input values.</p></li>
<li><p><code>random</code> allow you to select ramdomly a value in a list.</p></li>
<li><p>you don't need to calculate every single possibility. You can either have a draw, a win or a loose. if you don't win or draw, you loose, no computation needed here.</p></li>
<li><p>when you name something, try to use the same name for the same thing everything, otherwise it could be missleading. eg (userInput / computerChoice) why do we have input and choice two different words for the same kind of value ? i would choose userChoice and computerChoice instead.</p></li>
<li><p>Your coding convention does not respect pep8 standard. You should be using snake_case.</p></li>

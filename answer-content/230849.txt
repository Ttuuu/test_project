<p>You could use an ENUM instead of a String for the type of piece.</p>

<p>The colors (white/black "#fff"/"#000") should be declared as variables at the top, to make it easier to change.</p>

<p>Try to avoid magic numbers / Strings. For example, why multiply by 0.9 here?</p>

<pre><code>const size = Math.min(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight) * 0.9;
</code></pre>

<p>You should use methods more often. Ensure your current method names make sense and are not doing too many things. If we wanted to add a rule, it's currently hard to tell where it should be added (<code>getSquares</code>).</p>

<p>An example rule to add: Player must move king to avoid a checkmate (as in real chess).</p>

<p>On a positive note I was surprised how well your game works, given the small amount of code.</p>

<p>In User, you define a user's name as:</p>

<pre><code>private String firstName;
private String lastName;
</code></pre>

<p>This is something that is very common, and very wrong. I am one of those oddballs that use a first initial, a middle name, and a last name. This is not uncommon in the US, and in my case is a family tradition -- we start using our middle name when we become adults, and so it feels like somebody is calling me a child when they insist on using our first name. And no, I will not put my middle name into a slot that asks for a first name.</p>

<p>It can get even stranger even in the US. We had "The Artist Formerly Known As Prince" (look it up if you don't remember) -- he changed his name to an unpronounceable symbol.</p>

<p>Then there was "Moon Unit Zappa" (Moon Unit was her first name).</p>

<p>Then there are names from countries/cultures outside the US.</p>

<p>And, just to make it even nastier, names are <em>not</em> unique! Even with a single "name" field, I doubt there are more than a handful of unique names in the US (Ms. Zappa may be one of those unique names, I certainly hope so.)</p>

<li><p>Thread creation is an expensive operation, and you do it way more than needed. Even though the number of threads running at any given time is capped, the threads are constantly joined and recreated over and over again (I run your code with cap of 10, over a 1000000-strong array, and counted 50 thread creations). Use a thread pool instead.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no need to start <em>two</em> threads. The calling thread may very well continue sorting one of the halves.</p></li>
<li><p>As said in comments, using more threads than hardware supports will cause slowdown. The software threads are beneficial only when they have natural blocking points (due to IO or synchronization). Sorting is not the case here.</p></li>

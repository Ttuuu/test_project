<h3>Clearer Method Parameters</h3>

<p>In the line <code>input_prompt(0)</code>, it is not immediately obvious what the argument represents without first checking the method signature. Some alternatives are to define constants for each case, or to use an <code>enum</code> for the argument instead. e.g.</p>

<pre><code>enum class InputLine
{
    SameLine,
    NewLine
};

void input_prompt(InputLine line);

input_prompt(InputLine::SameLine);
</code></pre>

<h3>Stricter Typing</h3>

<p>Using an <code>enum</code> instead of strings for <code>accepted_unit</code> and <code>conversion</code> values would be a safer approach as it would fail at compile-time, instead of runtime when a problematic string is used. You would need to add a method to handle the conversion of entered unit to <code>enum</code> with this approach however.</p>

<h3>Naming</h3>

<p>I feel that your naming generally make sense and make clear what the method does. I would perhaps rename <code>vector_print</code> along the lines of <code>vector_print_meters</code>, just to make it more obvious without needing to read the method body.</p>

<p>I find it useful to look at where a method is called and see if I can guess everything that method will do without having to look at it. Having someone else look can be even better as it
eliminates your own knowledge/bias.</p>

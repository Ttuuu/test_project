<p>Having multiple interface constraints on a single generic parameter isn't a code smell; it can make sense in a number of cases.  </p>

<p>However, for the two interfaces you mention, does it make sense to have an IRealmSize that isn't part of an IRealm?  It may make be more appropriate to use:</p>

<pre><code>interface IBoundedRealm : IRealm
{
    int TilesWide { get; }
    int TilesHigh { get; }
}
</code></pre>
    </div>

<p>There are a couple of problems:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You connected the buttons instead of the text fields to your model.</p></li>
<li><p>You have two text fields but only a single value in your model. In proper MVC, each text field should be attached to a different property of the model.</p></li>
<li><p>You always send a change event. Your model should only send change events when the new value isn't the same as the old one.</p></li>
<li><p>You should tell your <code>StateChangedListener</code> which aspect of the model changed. Pass the name of the property, for example.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>One good approach is to request location updates in batch like this.
so you will be less frequently requesting for location updates:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>LocationRequest request = new LocationRequest();
request.setInterval(10 * 60 * 1000);
request.setMaxWaitTime(60 * 60 * 1000);
</code></pre>
  
  <p>In this case, location is computed roughly every ten minutes, and
  approximately six location data points are delivered in a batch
  approximately every hour. While you still get location updates every
  ten minutes or so, you conserve battery because your device is woken
  up only every hour or so.

<p>From the end of the chapter 1.8:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"When the name of an array is used as an argument, the value passed to
  the function is the location or address of the beginning of the array
  - there is no copying of array elements. By subscripting this value, the function can access and alter any element of the array".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, when you pass array as an argument to a function, you don't create a local copy of array. Instead, you create a pointer (Chapter 5) and work with it as with an array. </p>

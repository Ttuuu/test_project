<p>I would further improve <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/225148/59161">Henrik Hansen</a>'s code by throwing away the <code>if</code>s and integrating the preconditions inside in the queries so they would become:</p>

<pre><code>yield articles.Where(article =&gt; !filters.IsAvailable.HasValue || article.IsAvailable == filters.IsAvailable);
</code></pre>

<p>This would not only make it more readable but would show us that now we can actually generate these expressions (probably with <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/225146/59161">Jesse C. Slicer</a>'s code) which would save us a lot of typing.</p>

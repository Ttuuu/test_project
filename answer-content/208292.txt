<p>Nice project! I would bring another point not touched by kaidokuupa:</p>

<p>You should follow <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP8</a> which is the official style guide for writing Python. It's a set of guideline to write code readable by others, which is very important when you will be working on open source project and/or in an enterprise environment. </p>

<p>To help you conform to this standard, you can use what is called "Linter" which is a software telling you if you follow the standard (or you can configure it to implement your own standard most of the time). Example of linter for Python are <a href="http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">flake8</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ambv/black" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Black</a> (this one also rewrite your code), <a href="https://www.pylint.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Pylint</a> and many more I'm not aware of probably.</p>

<p>Using a linter can be integrated with a Continuous Integration tool when you use your favorite CVS (Git, Mercurial, SVN ...)</p>

<p>Another point is your comments should describe the 'Why' not 'What'. 
For example</p>

<pre><code>#function to get weather data
def get_weather_data(city, code):
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>This comment is not very helpful. And to comment function/method you should probably use <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docstring</a> instead.
A good article on writing code comment <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/code-tells-you-how-comments-tell-you-why/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> by one of the founders of StackOverflow.com.</p>

<p>So far I managed to use just ~20% on an 8 core System, ( ~2.5% pro core )</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's not how it works, your program is completely single threaded, so it only uses one core. 100% / 4 = ~20% (obviously the maximum is 25%), which is exactly what you're seeing: you're maxing out a core.</p>
<p>First thing I would do is make the image encoding multi-threaded, and absolutely not on the capture thread.</p>
<p>It's not entirely clear what you're trying to achieve with this overall, but if you're saving to memory to display them later and are thinking about GDI+ again, you should probably scrap this and use hardware acceleration (OpenGL, DirectX, Direct2D, etc). And you should reconsider encoding as PNG or whatever you are encoding to if you're just using it as temporary storage, keep the uncompressed bitmap instead.</p>

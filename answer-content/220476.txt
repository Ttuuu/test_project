<p>The 99th percentile is due to the linear nature of your approach. The goal of this exercise is to figure out a logarithmic one.</p>

<p>I don't want to spell out the algorithm entirely. Just a hint to get you started. Take a middle element of <code>nums1</code>. Find its lower bound in <code>nums2</code>; call it <code>i2</code>. In the sorted array the selected element would be at the position <code>nums1.length/2 + i2</code>. I hope the hint is a good enough.</p>

<hr>

<p><code>pivot</code> doesn't look like a good name to me. <code>totalLength</code>, perhaps?</p>

<hr>

<p>The complicated logic inside the loop also hurts the performance. Consider looping until you reach the midpoint:</p>

<pre><code>    while (i1 + i2 &lt; pivot)
</code></pre>

<p>and do the final median finding afterwards.</p>

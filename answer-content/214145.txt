<p>Nice code - I might reuse that pattern!</p>

<p>Some suggestions for the class implementation:</p>

<ul>
<li>I would recommend <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings" rel="nofollow noreferrer">formatted string literals</a> in Python 3.6+ over concatenation.</li>
<li>A linter such as <code>flake8</code> will suggest some changes to make your code more pythonic, such as making the class name CamelCase.</li>
<li>What causes a <code>TypeError</code> and why do you throw it away?</li>
<li><code>output</code> might as well be inlined.</li>
<li>Rather than the ambiguously named <code>sign</code> variable I would prefer <code>signature = inspect.signature(â€¦)</code>.</li>
</ul>

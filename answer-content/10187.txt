<p>Here are some of my thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li>I don't see the point in providing the path as a dot separated string, but it may be useful in your application. </li>
<li>If you keep the dot separated string, then you should consider extracting the recursive function into a separate internal function, so that you don't have to repeat the check of the path argument in each iteration. </li>
<li>Why do you check for the <code>shift</code> method? If it doesn't exist, then your function will fail silently. The regular "method does not exist" exception would be much more useful. Instead implement the method on the <code>Array.prototype</code> yourself separately if it doesn't exist. </li>
<li>Finally I would move the <code>path.length == 0</code> to the start of the function. That is where the break condition of recursive functions are usually expected. </li>
</ul>

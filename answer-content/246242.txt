<p>You say the exponent is written in binary, but then you're reading it as decimal, call it <code>binary</code> (even though it's a number, not a string, so it's neither binary nor decimal), somehow convert it, and call the result <code>decimal</code> (again not true, as it's a number, not a string). Just read it as binary instead of all of that.</p>
<p>For efficiency, don't compute the whole power. That's highly inefficient, both time and space. Use <code>pow</code> appropriately, making it work modulo 100 <em>during</em> the exponentiation so it's super fast.</p>
<p>The whole efficient solution:</p>
<pre><code>base = int(input())
exponent = int(input(), 2)
print(pow(base, exponent, 100))
</code></pre>

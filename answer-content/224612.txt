<h2>Rubocop Report</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Rubocop</a> was able to solve minor layout issues regarding the use of white spaces. One note-worthy change it proposed is:</p>

<ul>
<li>[Corrected] Style/StringLiterals: Prefer single-quoted strings when you don't need string interpolation or special symbols.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>days_aggregate.each do | key, task |
  parts = key.split("-")
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<pre><code> parts = key.split('-')
</code></pre>

<p>A bigger complexity issue it found was:</p>

<ul>
<li>Metrics/AbcSize: Assignment Branch Condition size for work_per_month is too high. [33/15]</li>
<li>Metrics/MethodLength: Method has too many lines. [30/10]</li>
</ul>

<p>This means your method <code>work_per_month</code> is doing way too much. It has more than double the <a href="https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/rubocop/0.27.0/RuboCop/Cop/Metrics/AbcSize" rel="nofollow noreferrer">AbcSize</a> than the suggested threshold <code>[33/15]</code>. You should split this method in sub-routines.</p>

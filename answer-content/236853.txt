<p>This is a strange way to compute an integral. For each step, you're choosing the greater of the f(x) values given the current <code>i</code> or the previous <code>i</code> to calculate the area. I'd imagine it'd be better to choose a more conventional method such as Middle Riemann Sum, which is what I believe most modern calculators use. If you want to do a trapezoidal approximation, you can simply average a Left and Right Riemann sum (which is mathematically equivalent), but that would require you to cycle from <code>a</code> to <code>b</code> twice, which is slow, but maybe more accurate than a Middle Riemann Sum.</p>

<p>Your integral function ought to be a pure function: each input has the same output, it is unaffected by state, and it does not affect state.</p>

<p>Right now, the integral function is affected by the state <code>step</code> and <code>f1</code> and also affects the state <code>iterations</code>.</p>

<p>Instead, your code would be much cleaner if you made <code>step</code> and <code>function</code> arguments to integral. As for <code>iterations</code>, that can be easily computed by <code>(b-a)/step</code>.</p>

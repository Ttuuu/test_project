<p>You're ignoring the Date-part of the timestamps; it doesn't sound like that's on purpose. 
(Also, the year is missing altogether, which should make us quite nervous.) 
Also, let's use explicit <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime" rel="nofollow noreferrer">datetime utilities</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">regexes</a>. </p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>import datetime
import re

timestamp_regex = re.compile("[^:]+:\d\d:\d\d")

def convert_time(logline):
    stamp = timestamp_regex.match(logline).group() #this will error if there's no match.
    d = datetime.strptime(stamp, "%b %e %H:%M:%S")
    return int(d.timestamp())
</code></pre>

<p>As for the rest, the comments are right that we can't do much unless we know exactly <em>what it would mean for the solution to be improved</em>.  </p>

<p>If the concern is just to handle the biggest file with the least ram, something like this might work: </p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>def save_where_we_can_find_it(line, temp_file):
    retval = temp_file.tell()
    temp_file.write(line)
    return retval

def fetch_line(location, temp_file):
    temp_file.seek(location)
    return temp_file.readline()

items = []

with open("log.txt", 'r') as original, open(".temp.log.txt", 'w') as temp:
    for line in original:
        items.append((convert_time(line), save_where_we_can_find_it(line, temp)))

items.sort(key = lambda pair: pair[0]) #sort-in-place isn't necessarily a good idea; whatever.

with open(".temp.log.txt", 'r') as temp:
    for (stamp, location) in items:
        print(fetch_line(location, temp))

import os
os.remove(".temp.log.txt")
</code></pre>

<p>But this is just a really inefficient way using a scratch-file. Better to register scratch-space in the OS, and then do your file manipulation "in memory". </p>

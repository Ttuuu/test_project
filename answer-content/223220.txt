<p>A few general points that I noticed</p>

<ul>
<li>Place all the functions at the top and then the main function beneath. I couldn't understand how you were getting some of your values but realised you made main() block calls in between functions </li>
</ul>

<p>Rather than:</p>

<pre><code>def function1():
    ...

[code]...

def funciton2():
    ...

[more code]...
</code></pre>

<p>say </p>

<pre><code>def function1():
    ...

def function2():
    ...


[code]....
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>It is good practice to put all of your "out of block" code in a function entitled <code>if __name__ == "__main__"</code> This means that if the code is imported by another function, it won't run automatically </li>
</ul>

<pre><code>def function1():
    ...

def function2():
    ...


if __name__ == "__main__"
    [code]....
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Rather than: <code>for i in range (0, 10)</code> say <code>for i in range(10)</code> as the 0 is implicit </li>
<li>This code</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>number_of_games = input(f'Number of games? For auto players mainly ')
number_of_games = int(number_of_games)
</code></pre>

<p>can be re-written as</p>

<pre><code>number_of_games = int(input(f'Number of games? For auto players mainly '))
</code></pre>

<p>As I am a newbite too, I think I will leave other suggestion to more experienced users but I try and offer what I can</p>

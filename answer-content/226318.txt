<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>Html Id's Must be A unique Value for each element, If you wish to Name things with the same name then class Should be used instead.</p>

<p>inside your Css </p>

<pre><code>#userinput &gt; Box Shadow has a spelling mistake. of 10ox instead of 10px.

background-color: Can be shortened to just background:YourColor;

Opacity Property should be between 0 &amp; 1, 0.60 =&gt; The 0 is redundant and can be removed
</code></pre>

<p>inside your footer Css I would swap the div &amp; the a, order around as the a is inside the div. &amp; also The default color is black anyway. So this can possibly be removed. I noticed you using padding-top it seems to set the height of the footer, this is Ok, but just 'height' is 4 less Characters. So shortens your code slightly. </p>

<p>also if you are just starting out try to get into the habbit of using 'vw', 'vh', 'vmin' &amp; 'vmax' units for any widths and heights.<br>
They stand for;</p>

<pre><code>  'vh'   =&gt; viewport Height,
  'vw'   =&gt; viewport Width,
  'vmin' =&gt; viewport Minimum,
  'vmax' =&gt; viewport Maximum.
</code></pre>

<p>They Are responsive to The device that A page is being viewed on, Where-as px, rem, em etc are not truely responsive. Hope these help :)</p>

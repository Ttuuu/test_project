<p>This could be shortened by looping through <code>requiredXP[]</code> until you reach a value that <code>curXP</code> is equal to or using a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/switch.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">switch</a> statement. The same could be done in <code>levelUpXp()</code>.<br>
You are right that using and <code>ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;</code> could simplify things as well. Possibly look into a list or queue data type.<br>
You could also call <code>ding()</code> from inside <code>levelUp()</code> or <code>levelUpXp()</code> instead of the while loop or set a flag variable (eg. <code>newLevel</code>) that it tests for to skip the test conditions inside.</p>

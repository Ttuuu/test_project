<p>The code looks good to me, it is well documented and I do not have much to say.</p>

<p><strong>Suggestion for <code>_partition_by</code></strong></p>

<p>In:</p>

<pre><code>    if returned == last_value:
        chunk.append(x)
    else:
        if chunk:
            yield chunk
        chunk = [x]
</code></pre>

<p>I'd tried to write <code>chunk = [x]</code> as <code>chunk = [] ; chunk.append(x)</code>. This allows some rewriting as you can extract the common line out of the <code>if / else</code>.</p>

<pre><code>    if returned == last_value:
        pass
    else:
        if chunk:
            yield chunk
        chunk = []
    chunk.append(x)
</code></pre>

<p>Then revert condition</p>

<pre><code>    if returned != last_value:
        if chunk:
            yield chunk
        chunk = []
    chunk.append(x)
</code></pre>

<p>Then group condition as there is nothing to do when <code>chunk</code> is already empty.</p>

<pre><code>    if chunk and returned != last_value:
        yield chunk
        chunk = []
    chunk.append(x)
</code></pre>

<p>There is nothing wrong with the way things were done, this is a pure personal preference.</p>

<p><strong>Details about docstring</strong></p>

<p>The docstrings are slightly inconsistent as we have two different forms for the verb: with and without the final 's'. If that can be of any help, there are Docstring conventions for Python in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/" rel="noreferrer">PEP 257</a>.</p>

<p>It suggests:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The docstring is a phrase ending in a period. It prescribes the
  function or method's effect as a command ("Do this", "Return that"),
  not as a description; e.g. don't write "Returns the pathname ...".</p>

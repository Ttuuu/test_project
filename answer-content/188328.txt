<ul>
<li>I would add a variable <code>var ftpClient = StoryManager.MainWindow.FtpClient;</code> to shorten the calls to FtpClient a bit</li>
<li>You catch exceptions several times, but handle them equally. And also continue after an error. I would make a single try..catch block around everything. So the exception handling code is not duplicated and the following actions don't get executed. (Why try to add a project dir to user dir project dir does not exist yet?)</li>
</ul>

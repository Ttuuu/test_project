<p>I made a benchmark. The test data is a Python list with 1,000,000 numbers between 1 and 30 (inclusive). I've tested every answer that has been given so far:</p>

<pre><code>0.044s mean time - balanced_alex_2
0.047s mean time - balanced_alex
0.050s mean time - balanced_peilonrayz
0.060s mean time - balanced_mark
0.061s mean time - balanced_delta
0.065s mean time - balanced_mti2935
0.066s mean time - balanced_kangalioo_expanded
0.154s mean time - balanced_kangalioo_compact
0.178s mean time - balanced_anonymous
</code></pre>

<p>The top two answers by Mark and Peilonrayz carelessly traded readability in an attempt to gain speed - only somewhat successfully as you can see. Alex' answers dominate the benchmark instead.</p>

<p>My answers went all in on readability, while disregarding performance. You can see that even my answer is in the same ballpark as the optimized version from Alex.</p>

<p>Even Alex' code is not as fast as you can go, though. Changing the code to use a NumPy array yields a mean runtime of 0.011s for Numpy - 4x faster than the fastest Python answer.</p>

<p>Conclusion; if you need</p>

<ul>
<li>best performance and ok readability =&gt; Numpy</li>
<li>ok performance and bad readability =&gt; <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/242570/220605">Alex</a></li>
<li>acceptable performance and best readability =&gt; <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/242688/220605">kangalioo</a></li>
</ul>

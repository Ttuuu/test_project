<p>Don't unconditionally call <code>Main()</code> from global scope - if someone else imports your file, you want to leave it up to them what should be executed. This is why you should use the <code>if __name__ == '__main__'</code> pattern that we see so often elsewhere.</p>

<p><code>self.guesses</code> shouldn't be a list. Since you need fast lookup, even though it won't make a noticeable difference, you should be using a set.</p>

<p>One thing you should keep in mind is that when the <code>Add</code> fails, your user is left without a password as it's already been removed. When will this fail? Usually when your password does not pass the validation.</p>

<p>Of course, seeing how an admin is doing it, there's <em>probably</em> not so much of a problem as they can simply add a different one - as long as the message is clear enough to show there actually is a problem with adding the new password.</p>

<p>The way Microsoft wants you to tackle this is by using a <code>PasswordResetToken</code>.</p>

<pre><code>var code = await _userManager.GeneratePasswordResetTokenAsync(user);
await _userManager.ResetPasswordAsync(user, code, newPassword);
</code></pre>

<p>For this you'll have to fiddle around a bit with the token generators that <code>Identity</code> provides.</p>

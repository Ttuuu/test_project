<p>Reversing is not very efficient indeed (<em>but who cares about an extra linear pass when bubble sort itself is quadratic?</em>). I would rather account for the requested order during the comparison:</p>

<pre><code>result = strcmp(...);
if (!ascending)
    result = -result;
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Initialization <code>f = strs</code> is very confusing, because later on <code>f</code> is reinitialized to <code>sorted</code>. I'd initialize it to <code>sorted</code> always, as close to use as possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>Something like</p>

<pre><code>for(int u=0; u &lt; size; ++u) {
    char ** f = sorted;
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; size - 1; ++i) {
        ...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>One-character names, especially unmotivated like <code>f</code>, <code>u</code> and <code>q</code> should be avoided. You really have to figure out <em>what</em> the variable is, and name it accordingly.</li>
</ul>

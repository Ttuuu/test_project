<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>These things are very much a matter of preference but I would go for something like:</p>

<pre><code>mails = [ @note.cc_emails,
          @note.to_emails ].compact.join('')
</code></pre>

<p>which tends to remain usable as you add more clauses</p>
    </div>

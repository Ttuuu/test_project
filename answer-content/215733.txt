<p>Good code primary doesn't need to be the most efficient, it needs to be readable, so you should make sure it is correctly formated and indented.</p>

<hr>

<p>More importantly it needs to be correct. Here are some examples of wrong results:</p>

<pre><code>nThOrderStatistic([6,7,43,2,95], 4); // Expected result: 95, returns undefined

nThOrderStatistic([1], 0); // Expected result: 1, returns undefined

nThOrderStatistic([1, 1, 2], 1); // Expected result: 2, returns 1.
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>It's not really "more" efficient either. Sorting the array is much more inefficient, than directly looking for the nth lowest element in it (or than just looking for the two lowest elements). </p>

<hr>

<p>And finally, it's bad form of a function like this one to unexpectedly modify its input (in this case sort the given array).</p>

<pre><code>    int gcd,sum,maxgcd=0,maxsum=0;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>You don't need to declare <code>gcd</code> and <code>sum</code> yet.  </p>

<pre><code>    int maxGcd = 0;
    int maxSum = 0;
</code></pre>

<p>It's also generally better not to initialize more than one variable per line.  It's not a functional difference.  It's a readability thing.  </p>

<p>The Java standard is to capitalize the second and later words.  </p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>            sum = A[A_i] + B[B_i];
            gcd = gcdcalc(A[A_i], B[B_i]);
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This could be </p>

<pre><code>            int sum = A[A_i] + B[B_i];
            int gcd = gcdcalc(A[A_i], B[B_i]);
</code></pre>

<p>You don't use these outside the current iteration.  So you can declare and initialize them at the same time.  </p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>            if(maxgcd == gcd)
            {
                if(maxsum &lt; sum)
                    maxsum = sum;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This could be </p>

<pre><code>            else if (maxgcd == gcd &amp;&amp; maxsum &lt; sum)
            {
                maxsum = sum;
</code></pre>

<p>If the <code>maxgcd</code> is less than <code>gcd</code>, then they won't be equal.  So we don't need to check both.  The <code>else</code> makes it so that we only check for equality if not less than.  </p>

<p>You don't need two <code>if</code> statements.  One statement with two clauses is sufficient.  Due to the way that short circuit comparisons work, this will be the same efficiency as the original code.  </p>

<p>I prefer to have a space between the <code>if</code> and the <code>(</code>.  I find it easier to see that it is an <code>if</code> and not a method call that way.  </p>

<p>I would encourage you to add more vertical whitespace.  Again, I find breaking up the statements into logical groups makes it easier to read.  </p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>   if(y == 0)
   {
       return x; 
   }
   return gcdcalc(y, x%y);
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This could be just </p>

<pre><code>   return (y == 0) ? x : gcdcalc(y, x%y);
</code></pre>

<p>Same efficiency, just a bit terser.  </p>

<p>If you find yourself trying to wring out every bit of efficiency, there is an iterative version of this that is probably faster.  </p>

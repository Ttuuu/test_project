<p>Your <code>Prompter</code> class is quite big, and has several responsibilities: prompting for action, validating input and performing the action. It is very volatile, as any new action requires also updating the prompter. I'd break out the actions to their own classes, implementing an <code>BankingAction</code> interface. The prompter would then contain a list of actions, either through a constructor parameter or registered via a <code>registerAction(BankingAction action)</code> method. When prompting, it'd check this list, dispatch the action to the correct instance and be done with it.</p>

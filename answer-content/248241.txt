<p>I'm going to take your request at face value. Add an extension method:</p>
<pre><code>public static class UselessExtensions
{
    public static T ThrowIf&lt;T&gt;(this T input, Func&lt;T, bool&gt; predicate, string message)
        =&gt; predicate(input) ? throw new Exception(message) : input;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then use that in your method:</p>
<pre><code>// One liner
private double GetRandomNumberHigherThanHalf()
    =&gt; Random.NextDouble().ThrowIf(r =&gt; r &lt; 0.5, "randomNumber is lower than 0.5");
</code></pre>
<p>Your original code doesn't compile, there is no implicit conversion from <code>double</code> to <code>int</code>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Would you want to do this? No. Lines of code is a bad metric. You want your code to be as readable as possible. Not to be as short as possible. In this case, it stays readable because the extension method is well-named. You want to aim for your code being as concise as possible without affecting how easy it is to read.</p>

<p>The Java issues are already described above, so let me add Eclipse-specific points.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>This code will handle exceptions as expected in the main thread only (and will throw <code>InvalidThreadAccess</code> otherwise). But it is not a good idea to work with I/O in the main thread as the user will be unhappy with a frozen UI.</p></li>
<li><p>Showing dialogues from some operation is bad practice. One day you will get a very long chain of error dialogues because something is wrong with the URL or network address.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider using an <code>org.ecipse.core.runtime.IStatus</code> to describe the errors. Also, it will be good to pass some "reporter" instance to this method to decouple error reporting.</p></li>
</ol>

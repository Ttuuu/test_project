<p>Have you considered to split up your run_complete_flow() function? Personally I would prefer to put it in a class. The first part up to run_game would go into __init__(). Then I would try to split up the task into methods. E.g. you have a comment
<code># in this case we only need to find the power button, not click it</code> - why not put that code in a method like find_power_buttom()? My goal would be, to make the flow easily understandable by reading the code of run_complete_flow() without comments, by "hiding all the unnecessary stuff" in well named methods. That should make it a lot easier to change the flow if needed, or identify where to look when a certain step makes problems.</p>

<pre><code>def run_complete_flow(self):
    self.launch_as_soon_as_updated()
    self.advertising()
    self.check_power_button()
    self.accept_invite()
    self.in_lobby_get_slot_and_join()
    self.wait_for_match(time_out=180)
    radiant = self.check_radiant()
    if radiant:
        self.leave_match()
    else:
        # not sure, where to jump from here; consider puting whole 
        # radiant/dire "loop" in one method continue_until_radiant
        self.continue_if_dire()  
)

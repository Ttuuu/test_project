<p>Instead of this:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>$"{x.Key}{(x.Value ? "=" : string.Empty)}{x.Value}"
</code></pre>

<p>I would find it easier to understand this way:</p>

<pre><code>$"{x.Key}{(x.Value ? $"={x.Value}" : string.Empty)}"
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of testing-by-printing, why not have proper unit tests for this?
(So I don't have to read the output after every change and re-convince myself that it's still good.)</p>

<p>I'm a bit surprised that the class doesn't handle URI with domain names containing a dot, for example <code>https://stackoverflow.com/somepath</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>It might be an interesting feature to add,
when <code>!uriMatch.Success</code>, to check if the URI could actually be parsed by the standard <code>Uri</code> class.
That is, give a more clear signal to users of the class,
whether the URI is invalid, or it's just using some pattern not-yet-supported by <code>SimpleUri</code>.</p>

<p>Your code is <strong>fluent</strong>, and not really <strong>functional</strong>. </p>

<p>It solves a problem that Java’s try block doesn’t return a value, but I don’t see a benefit of it over extracting the try-catch block into a separate method/lambda.</p>

<p>To make it more functional, you need to allow operating on the <code>Try&lt;T&gt;</code> object on a higher level. For example, transforming the result before the code is executed. The first step would be extracting the interface. Is it <code>Supplier&lt;T&gt;</code>?</p>

<p>Try writing something similar to <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/vavr-try" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Try&lt;T&gt;</code> from Vavr</a>.</p>

<p>(Rant mode) This obsession with fluentism and calling it „functional” is in my opinion a sign of a novice Java 8 programmer, leading to monstrocities of <code>flatMapped</code>, <code>orElseGetted</code> <code>Optional</code> constructs. (/Rant mode)</p>

<p>Unfortunately I would reconsider the algorithm a bit further.</p>

<p>A multiple of 3 is characterized by a useful rule:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that for {2, 3, 6}, {2, 6}, {2, 3} any combination will fail.</p>

<p>So <em>bags</em> (unordered list of possible repeated elements) is the way to go:
loop over all bags.</p>

<p>The maximum value is given by the bag with most elements, the digits in decreasing order.</p>

<p>For a set of size <em>n</em> the number of combinations are 2<sup>n</sup>, if not considering 0. For a bag this is different: 6<sub>a</sub>06<sub>b</sub>3 = 6<sub>b</sub>06<sub>a</sub>3. Given different digits <em>d<sub>i</sub></em> with frequency <em>f<sub>i</sub></em> the total number of combinations is (Σ<sub>i</sub> f<sub>i</sub>)! / Π<sub>j</sub>(f<sub>j</sub>!)</p>

<ul>
<li>case of 0</li>
<li>number of occurences of some digit</li>
</ul>

<p>I leave the joy of a formula to you.</p>

<p>The example data to check:</p>

<pre><code>3, 6, 2, 36, 63, 62, 26, 32, 23, 236, 263, 326, 362, 623, 632
</code></pre>

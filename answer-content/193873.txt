<p>The code itself is fine. Computing the Easter date is an astronomical computation and it is not possible to make it easier to understand without actually adding a full demonstration about why it yields the correct result.</p>

<p>Since this is an accounting software I would consider the given level of (no) details fine.  I would however increase the capacity of the maintenance programmer to ensure that the code is correct by ensure that:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The method used has a traceable origin. AFAICT the computation implements the algorithm described by <a href="https://www.tondering.dk/claus/cal/easter.php" rel="noreferrer">Claus Tøndering</a> in his classical Calendar FAQ. (See Isn’t there a simpler way to calculate Easter?)  The source should be referenced in the code, <em>e.g.</em> “Compute Easter day à la <a href="https://www.tondering.dk/claus/cal/easter.php" rel="noreferrer">https://www.tondering.dk/claus/cal/easter.php</a>”.  If you are only interested by the modern era (post 1920) it is not worth mentioning the algorithm works only for the Gregorian calendar.</p></li>
<li><p>The variables used in your implementation match as closely as possible those used in the source, to ease verification.  (Which is not the case here, but you might have a better source for this purpose than I had.)</p></li>
<li><p>Besides the snippet above, there is unit tests for this computation.</p></li>

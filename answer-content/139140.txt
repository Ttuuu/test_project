<p>I don't think you get this better than O(N^2) in the worst case, so your solution is optimal in that way.</p>

<p>What you should do is changing the data structure of your point lists, because <code>RemoveAt</code>/<code>IndexOf</code> are O(N). You just waste time, when a linked list could do the same operation in O(1).</p>

<p>Also, <code>Math.Pow(x,2)</code> is probably a bit slower than just <code>x*x</code>. And the square root is altogether superfluous as long as you're interested in the smallest distance only (and not in the absolute value of it).</p>

<h1>Comments</h1>

<p>The comments such a <code>This is Mean.</code> are pointless.</p>

<p>And the comment </p>

<pre><code>// To call/run this function we can type mean(Your array of numbers separated with commas ',');
</code></pre>

<p>is a bit strange. Are they targeting people who don't know basic JavaScript syntax? Then why mention commas, but not the brackets (<code>[...]</code>) needed for an array.</p>

<p>It probably would be a good idea to instead use a standard comment format for documentation such as <a href="https://jsdoc.app/" rel="noreferrer">jsdoc</a>.</p>

<h1>Sorting</h1>

<p>The comparison function used for sorting (<code>(a, b) =&gt; a - b</code>) is pointless, because that is the default.</p>

<h1>Mutating the input array</h1>

<p>In <code>median</code> you are creating a copy of the input array with <code>.slice()</code> before sorting it, so that it isn't modified, which is a good thing. You should do the same in <code>mode</code> and <code>range</code>.</p>

<h1>Validating the input</h1>

<p>You should consider validating the input. <code>mean</code>, <code>mode</code> and <code>range</code> break or give unexpected results if you give them an empty array. It's probably best to check if they are receiving an array at all. </p>

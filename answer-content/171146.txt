<p>Without having the insight (or, honestly, time) to verify your actual algorithm, I can say that your Python is pretty good.</p>

<p>Only minor stuff - this kind of comment - <code># path to read data from</code> - should be turned into a PEP257-style docstring.</p>

<p>You should add a shebang at the top of your file, probably <code>#!/usr/bin/env python3</code>.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you're off to a good start.</p>

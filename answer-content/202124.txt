<p>Finally figured it out. Because I did a recursive CTE starting with component materials, I created an infinite loop (at least I think it is infinite, or pretty darn close).</p>

<pre><code>Material Part   Parent Part
a                b
a                b
a                c
b                c
</code></pre>

<p>As a quick example, I keep running through the above situation where a Material Part is in Parent Part b &amp; c. So it runs through both of those Parent Parts and then will loop back with b as the Material Part which is in Parent Part c so it will loop through that again unnecessarily. This is why I say I'm not sure if it is infinite. It's doing a ton of redundancy but not sure if there is an end.</p>

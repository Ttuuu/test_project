<p>Your code doesn't contain sample data, so any following code adjustments are made on just what I read from your code.</p>
<pre><code>answer=$( while ! head -c 1 | grep -i '[ny]' ;do true ;done )
stty $old_stty_cfg
if echo "$answer" | grep -iq "^y" ;then
        sleep 1
else
    echo -e "\n"
        exit 1
fi
</code></pre>
<p>Could be written as:</p>
<pre><code>read -p "Are you sure? " -n 1 -r
if ! [[ $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]] ; then
  exit 1   
fi
</code></pre>
<p>Not only is this way easier to read, but requires so much less hacking of the tty sessions to do so. Also, I'm of the opinion, if they answer anything but "Y" then exit the script immediately. In your case, YN is a funny mistype, but is a valid input which would cause your script to continue.</p>
<pre><code>if [[ $count -gt 90 ]] 2&gt; /dev/null || [[ $count -lt 1 ]] 2&gt; /dev/null
</code></pre>
<p>Should be written as:</p>
<pre><code>if [[ ( $count -gt 90 ) &amp;&amp; ( $count -lt 1 ) ]] ; then
</code></pre>
<p>This is one statement which represent multiple conditions. Again, this is sanitizing your variables and only using what you expect to happen.</p>
<p>I do not know why you are redirecting stderr to /dev/null and would be interested to see what bash flags here as errors which would be crucial to critiquing your code.</p>
<pre><code>   find ./School/Art -iname "*$df*-*$mf*.*" ! '(' -iname "*.txt" ')' -exec mv "{}" -t "./SchoolOld/Art" \;
    find ./School/Comp -iname "*$df*-*$mf*.*" ! '(' -iname "*.txt" ')' -exec mv "{}" -t "./SchoolOld/Comp" \;
    find ./School/Cont -iname "*$df*-*$mf*.*" ! '(' -iname "*.txt" ')' -exec mv "{}" -t "./SchoolOld/Cont" \;
</code></pre>
<p>Whenever you do something multiple times, consider using a for loop.</p>
<pre><code>for DIRECTORY in Art Comp Cont Eng Esp Geo Hist LPT; do 
    find ./School/${DIRECTORY} -iname "*$df*-*$mf*.*" ! '(' -iname "*.txt" ')' -exec mv "{}" -t "./SchoolOld/${DIRECTORY}" \;
done
</code></pre>

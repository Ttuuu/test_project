<p>Here are some examples that show pretty odd results:</p>

<p>What I would expect as result is something like</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0KhKm.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0KhKm.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>Especially here </p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KMKLr.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KMKLr.png" alt="enter image description here"></a> </p>

<p>where it says that <code>if</code> and <code>this</code> were deleted and added at the same place: <code>if this</code> should definitely be black.</p>

<p>Also here </p>

<p>it says every single word was deleted and replaced by something else while you could just do the following </p>

<p>and keep at least <code>to proove you wrong</code>. Note that this is only one possible solution and there are more than one for each comparison. To find the best solution you would need to calculate all possibilities and use a good criteria to decide which one of them would be the best one.</p>

<p>As I already explained in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58628570/how-can-i-output-the-matching-portion-of-two-strings-while-having-the-charact/58628990#58628990">this answer</a> the probelem to solve is <strong>a way</strong> more complex than you see in the first moment. </p>

<p>Especially if you want a <em>by charater</em> solution like the OP stated </p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/swNUc.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/swNUc.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>and not a much simpler <em>by word</em> solution (as you tried).</p>

<p>I see no simple answer to the issue beyond what I showed in the linked answer (using the dynamic programming technique).</p>

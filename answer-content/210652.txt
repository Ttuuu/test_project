<p>This is an awesome explanation. I just see one more extensible point by using strategies here, i.e. if the different types of processing can happen based employment categories like Permanent Employee, Contractors etc.</p>

<p>So here we can use processor strategies for different types of leaves and different categories, which can be return by a factory. And the <code>ProcessLeaveRequest</code> can take either strategy interface as input or can make a call to <code>leaveprocessorfactory</code> to return the proper strategy.</p>

<p>I hope I am making some sense here.</p>

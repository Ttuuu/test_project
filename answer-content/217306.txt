<p>Although your algorithm seems to handle the conversion of the expected chars to numbers and the subtraction and addition rules, it doesn't take care of invalid characters like <code>'K'</code> or <code>'b'</code> or any other <code>char</code>. It's not enough to validate against <code>null</code> or empty strings. <code>CharacterValue(char c)</code> defaults to <code>0</code> for invalid chars. It would be more appropriate to throw an <code>ArgumentOutOfRangeException</code> with a description of the invalid <code>char</code>.</p>

<p>Besides that, there are a couple of other rules for roman numbers, that you could try to handle. Project Euler has an excellent description of the few rules <a href="https://projecteuler.net/about=roman_numerals" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a></p>

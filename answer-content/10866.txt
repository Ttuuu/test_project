<p>Yes, this code is hard to follow. Some thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li>use generics, e.g. <code>private List&lt;String&gt; prerequisites</code></li>
<li>Provide useful constructors. E.g. Does a course without name make any sense? If not, the course name should be a constructor parameter</li>
<li>honour encapsulation, prefer immutable data. Is it ever required to rename an existing course? If not, setCourseName shouldn't be public</li>
<li>use the right representation. E.g. you often need the course prefix and the course number. Maybe it would be the best to split the course name already in the constructor, and store the parts, not the full name. This is also in the spirit of a "fail early" strategy.</li>
</ul>

<p>If I have time, I'll look deeper in the code. I think there are probably much more things that could be improved.</p>

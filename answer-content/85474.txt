<li><p><strong>Is <code>SecureRandom</code> ok for generating my KEY and my IV?</strong> </p>

<p>I would generally advise that you don't specify your own <code>SecureRandom</code> for the key generator, unless you have a specific reason to do so. By default, it will select the highest priority implementation it finds amongst the installed providers. </p>

<p>Also, if your code is used with a hardware security module (HSM) in the future, it will either completely ignore your request or it will even throw an exception to tell you that you mustn't try to specify an alternative source of randomness.</p>

<p>Using it to generate an IV value is fine.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What's up with all these exceptions?</strong></p>

<p>Yeah, irritating isn't it? The security APIs are peppered with checked exceptions. Fortunately, many of them extend <code>GeneralSecurityException</code>, so you can just throw that if you have no intention of acting upon the individual exceptions.</p>

<p>As in all code, throw exceptions that are appropriate to the abstraction of your API layer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Is my code creating any vulnerabilities in the encryption process? (mistakes maybe?)</strong> </p>

<p>No, it generally looks fine. You should specify "UTF-8" when converting your plaintext bytes to a string, but that's about it.</p>

<p>Obviously you'll need to store your IV along with your ciphertext when you eventually use this in anger.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Am I seeding <code>SecureRandom</code> properly?</strong></p>

<p>There's not really any need to seed a <code>SecureRandom</code> object. Many implementations of <code>SecureRandom</code> ignore the seeds they are supplied. Just create it using:</p>

<pre><code>SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
</code></pre>

<p>You are currently using <code>SecureRandom::generateSeed()</code> which is actually intended for seeding <em>other</em> PRNGs. There's no need to use it to re-seed your existing <code>SecureRandom</code> instance. Just use the basic no-arg constructor as I suggest above. </p></li>

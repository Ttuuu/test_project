<p>Look into using HashSets. If you want to see if an item is already in a list, you have to search through thousands of list items. With HashSets, it can perform the check instantly. </p>

<p>Go through your list of directory names alphabetically. Every time you look at a directory name, pass it through a method that will remove " - Copy..." etc from the end using substring methods. If that processed directory name is not part of the hash set, then add it. If it is already part of the hash set, delete it. </p>

<p>Are the OSU files identical (e.g., there are no minor differences like different white spacing)? If so, you can pass them through a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10520048/calculate-md5-checksum-for-a-file">checksum algorithm</a> to compare them. Basically, a file will produce a hash string based on its contents. If another file has the exact same contents, it will produce an identical hash string. If you change just one character, the hash string will be completely different. It's a fast and efficient way to tell if files are identical.</p>

<p>To see if you've encountered a file before, you can add file hash strings to a hash <em>set</em> (sorry for the confusing terminology). If a hash string already exists in your set, you can know for sure that you've seen the file before. </p>

<p>Hope this helps. </p>

<p>Here's how I would get the longer string:</p>

<pre><code>max(string_1, string_2, key=len)  # Returns the longer string
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>key</code> keyword argument is a pattern you'll see frequently in python. It accepts a function as an argument (in our case <code>len</code>).</p>

<p>If you wanted to find the longest of multiple strings, you could do that too:</p>

<pre><code>max('a', 'bc', 'def', 'ghi', 'jklm', key=len)  # =&gt; 'jklm'
</code></pre>

<p>Warning:</p>

<p>This solution is not a great fit if you need to know when two strings are of equal length. If that's a requirement of yours, you'd be better off using a solution from one of the other answers.</p>

<p>I won't bother updating this approach to handle that requirement: that would feel like working against the language.</p>

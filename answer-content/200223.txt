<p>Python allows indexing of strings, for instance <code>'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[3]</code> returns <code>'d'</code>, so you don't need to turn your string into a list. I would just hardcode the keys: <code>keypad = {1:'abc',2:'def' ...]</code>. You spent more code generating <code>keypad_dict</code> than it would take to just declare it. </p>

<p>Having <code>aux</code> and <code>iletters</code> be programs that recursively call each other is making things way more complicated than they need to be. You can just do <code>[''.join(_) for _ in itertools.product(keypad[__] for __ in numbers)]</code></p>

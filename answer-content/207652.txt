<p>Only a small review.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would you say this design approach is good?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  I did have trouble following the code though. I was not able to find a test that failed the coding goal.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the spirit of writing reusable code, should I move appending the '\n' and '\' to the main routine and make the function just split the string at breakpoint? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, moving that appending out of <code>foldline()</code> does make sense, yet "In the spirit of writing reusable code" I would move as much out of <code>main()</code> as reasonable too.  Perhaps an intervening function?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Or even, make one to find the breakpoint, and other to split the string?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, <code>foldline()</code> is lengthly and looses clarity with its length.</p>

<hr>

<p>Minor stuff</p>

<p><strong>Avoid order of precedence problems</strong></p>

<p>Consider effect of <code>bigline[LINEBUF * 2]</code> does not double the size.  Use <code>()</code> when a <code>define</code> has an expression.</p>

<pre><code>// #define LINEBUF MAXFC+2 
#define LINEBUF (MAXFC+2)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Uninitialized object evaluation</strong></p>

<p><code>getline()</code>  <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/207498/29485">UB in the pathological case sz == 1 as it tests uninitialized c with c == EOF</a>.  Simply change</p>

<pre><code>// int c;
int c = 0;
</code></pre>

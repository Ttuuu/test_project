<p>To be honest, I didn't read all of the code. I gave up half way through. I believe this is due to two points:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You are not using the established CSS terms, e.g. "block" instead of "rule" and "parameter" instead of "declaration".</p>
</li>
<li><p>Most of the comments confused me more than they helped.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally the parsing is too simple. It will choke on unexpected braces, for example <code>content: "}"</code>, and on group rules such as media queries.</p>

<p>In my opinion you should create a factory for creating a converter which would take an input of "source" scale and "target" scale, which would basically return a converter that first converts it to kelvin and only then to target scale. For example, the factory interface would be the following:</p>

<pre><code>void addConverter(Converter c);
Converter getConverter(Scale from, Scale to)
</code></pre>

<p>Meanwhile the converter abstract interface would be the following:</p>

<pre><code>public Temperature convert(Temperature from); 
</code></pre>

<p>And then implement the converter in pairs: <code>CelsiusKelvinConverter</code> and <code>KelvinCelsiusConverter</code>.</p>

<p>In addition: avoid casting. If you need to cast, your interface is flawed.</p>

<p>Regardless, if you were to ask anyone, odds are they will have a different opinion regarding the matter. My suggestion is asking about and making your conclusions.</p>

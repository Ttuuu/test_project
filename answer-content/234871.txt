<p>Using static methods only for your <code>IDGenerator</code> class is antipattern. It's better to make those instance methods and create instance of your class when you need it. One reason may be extendability, another can be thread safety. I have a feeling, that static local variable <code>lastTicketDate</code> will probably cause trouble with race conditions.</p>

<p>If you really want to have static access to it, consider making it singleton with static method to get the instance. It's not ideal, but still better approach and it's on the way to making your code non-static, keeping reference to your class in local/class variable rather than static access. Thread safety can still be issue since any thread can access statically your class as long as there is static method to get it.</p>

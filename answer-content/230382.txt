<p>A few things I noticed:</p>

<p>In <code>maskPass</code> after each <code>ReadKey</code> you're either concatenating a character with <code>pass</code> or you're assigning <code>pass</code> to a <code>Substring</code> of <code>pass</code>.  This is very inefficient.  Each concatenation and each call to <code>Substring</code>, creates a new string.  It would be much better to use a <code>StringBuilder</code> to store the string until you're ready to return it.</p>

<p>In <code>verifyHashedPass</code> you convert the string <code>oldPw</code> to a string then assign it to a variable, then you only use that variable once.  I would suggest using <code>oldPw</code> directly.</p>

<p>Also in the loop where you verify that the 2 hashes are the same, instead of using a <code>bool</code> there, it would make more sense to return false as soon as you find a mismatch and true if the loop finishes.</p>

<p>In the <code>Credentials</code> class, you can simplify it by using automatic get and set:</p>

<pre><code>public string username{ get; set;}
</code></pre>

<p>This translates to the same thing as you are already doing but making it much more simple.</p>

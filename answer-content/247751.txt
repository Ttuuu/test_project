<p>First, why not write a function to compute surcharges? They're the same for both numbers, right? So you would be adding</p>
<pre><code>num1 + surcharge(num1) + num2 + surcharge(num2)
</code></pre>
<p>which I think takes care of a lot of the DRY you're looking for.</p>
<p>As for ternary operators, you can use them in a tabular form depending on operator precedence. Something like this:</p>
<pre><code>return num &lt;= 10 ? 1 :
       num &lt;= 20 ? 2 : 
                   3;
</code></pre>
<p>It's really one long line, but you're relying on operator precedence to group the second and later ternary expressions together in the else-clause of the first expression.</p>

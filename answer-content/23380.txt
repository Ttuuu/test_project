<p><strong>Python hint number 1:</strong></p>

<p>The pythonic way to do :</p>

<pre><code>n = 1
while n &lt; 1000:
    # something using n
    n = n + 1
</code></pre>

<p>is :</p>

<pre><code>for n in range(1,1000):
    # something using n
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Python hint number 2:</strong></p>

<p>You could make your code a one-liner by using list comprehension/generators :</p>

<pre><code>print sum(n for n in range(1,1000) if (n%3==0 or n%5==0))
</code></pre>

<p>Your code works fine but if instead of 1000, it was a much bigger number, the computation would take much longer. A bit of math would make this more more efficient.</p>

<p><strong>Math hint number 1 :</strong></p>

<p>The sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000 is really the sum of (the sum of all the multiples of 3 below 1000) plus (the sum of all the multiples of 5 below 1000) minus the numbers you've counted twice.</p>

<p><strong>Math hint number 2 :</strong></p>

<p>The number you've counted twice are the multiple of 15.</p>

<p><strong>Math hint number 3 :</strong></p>

<p>The sum of the multiple of 3 (or 5 or 15) below 1000 is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression#Sum">sum of an arithmetic progression.</a></p>

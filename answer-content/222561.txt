<p>Another point that hasn't been fleshed out by other reviewers is the generated python code.</p>

<p><code>list</code> is a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html" rel="noreferrer">built-in function</a> in python - by calling your list <code>list</code> you are overriding it. That's generally considered bad form in the python community, mostly because someone could be stung if they try to use the <code>list</code> constructor later in the code.</p>

<p>So instead, let's name the list after what it contains. I'm thinking <code>points</code>.</p>

<p>Creating a list and then manually appending every item could be rather slow for a large list - so lets create the list in one go. You could do this as a one liner - that way it's all in the first line and (assuming you don't word wrap) you can skip past it to the flesh of the program. But if we're going for neatness - I'd arrange it like this;</p>

<pre><code>points = [
    (1,45,6),
    (7,8,5),
    (10,77,88),
    (99999,1,1),
    (5,7,6),
    (1,2,3),
    (4,5,6),
]
</code></pre>

<p>This is pretty easy to generate - as all you need to do is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write the header (<code>points = [</code>)</li>
<li>The leading indentation, the value, then a trailing comma (<code>    {line},</code>)</li>
<li>Then the footer (<code>]</code>).</li>
<li>Then you can write the rest of the program as you were planning to anyway (In this case, <code>print(points)</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that trailing commas on the last item is accepted in python (some even encourage it, like myself) so you don't need to worry about detecting where you are in the file.</p>

<p>Lastly, if you want to keep your main python code separate to your list - consider using imports. Assuming you call your generated file <code>points.py</code>, your main code could start with the following:</p>

<pre><code>from points import points
print(points)
</code></pre>

<p>This has the advantage of not having to write your python code in a large C string.</p>

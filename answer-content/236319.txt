<p>With 90k gps records and 370k vehicle records, the inner loop of the current code runs <strong>33.3 Billion</strong> times.  To get significant speed ups will require a different approach.</p>

<p>I would suggest converting everything to an event: gps event, engineon event, engineoff event, and so on.  Put it all into a big queue (list) and sort it by time stamp.  It looks like the gps data and vehicle events are already sorted, or nearly so.  On my machine, it takes less than a second to sort a million records.  Could use a heap instead of sorting.</p>

<p>Then loop through the events once, updating the status of the vehicles and jobs, and collecting data, as you go.</p>

<p>The first thing I noticed was your indentation. On some lines the indentation is not consistent. Try to keep your indentation consistent as it helps others read your code.</p>

<p>You also write a lot of comments in your code but comments are usually not necessary. I only write comments to explain certain design choices which are not clear from the code (for example doing some low-level code because it improves performance rather than readability) or I write comments to explain a difficult algorithm or procedure of steps. A lot of your comments distract from the actual code or are confusing. For example</p>

<pre class="lang-php prettyprint-override"><code>//Store children terms 
$childrenCheck = get_term_children( $parent_term-&gt;term_id, $parent_term-&gt;taxonomy );
</code></pre>

<p>The comment says something about storing children terms but the method called is called <code>get_term_children</code> implying there is something fetched, not stored. I assume you mean storing the children terms in the variable, but in that case a comment stating <code>//fetching children term</code> would be better as most developers understand that the children terms are stored in the variable. No comment would even be better as most experienced developers read the code and immediately see that the children terms are fetched.</p>

<p>If comments help you understand your code better and you are the only one reading your code, by all means. But you should also try to read and understand code without comments.</p>

<p>A general rule of thumb is that a lot of nested structures is not a good sign. You now have a foreach inside an if inside a foreach inside an if inside a foreach. What you can do for example for each foreach statement is take all the code inside the foreach statement and extract it into a separate function. Try to give each of these functions descriptive names what they are doing.</p>

<p>You also have a lot of repetition when it comes to echoing. The following</p>

<pre class="lang-php prettyprint-override"><code>echo '&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="'. get_term_link( $parent_term ) .'"&gt;'. $parent_term-&gt;name.'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;';
</code></pre>

<p>is used quite a lot throughout your code. You can extract this to a method, something like</p>

<pre class="lang-php prettyprint-override"><code>function printListItem($term) {
  echo '&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="'. get_term_link( $term ) .'"&gt;'. $term-&gt;name.'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;';
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this way when you have to change something to each list item at the same time (for example, adding a html class to the <code>li</code>s) you only have to do it in one place.</p>

<p>The check for children can also be extracted into a separate function, say</p>

<pre class="lang-php prettyprint-override"><code>function hasChildren($term) {
  $children = get_term_children( $term-&gt;term_id, $term-&gt;taxonomy );
  return !is_wp_error($children) &amp;&amp; !empty($children);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Than you can use it like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-php prettyprint-override"><code>foreach ( $parent_terms as $parent_term ) {   
  if (hasChildren($parent_term) {
    ...
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I think this is a good set of improvements for you to start with to improve the readability of your code. Just keep practicing and eventually you will write clearer code and understand how to improve your own code :)</p>

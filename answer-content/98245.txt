<p>Interesting proposal! I could hardly read the expression that you've been working with, so I started from scratch and have built the following:</p>

<pre><code>\D?(\d{0,3}?)\D{0,2}(\d{3})?\D{0,2}(\d{3})\D?(\d{4})$
</code></pre>

<p>I tried to take out some of the conditional and capturing groups to clear it up. So we can split this into four part:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><code>\D?(\d{0,3}?)</code></p>

<p>Is there anything that isn't a number? it's probably a <code>+</code> or something so we'll make sure not to capture that. Then we look for a country code. You had only a check for a single digit country code, and if that's what you want, fine. However, know that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_country_calling_codes" rel="noreferrer">some nations have codes more than one character in length</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>\D{0,2}(\d{3})?</code></p>

<p>Is there a dash or a parenthesis? Or both? If so, count those out. Is there an area code? If so, capture it.</p></li>
<li><p><code>\D{0,2}(\d{3})</code></p>

<p>Same as the previous section, except we're expecting to find those 3 digits, as they're necessary.</p></li>
<li><p><code>\D?(\d{4})$</code></p>

<p>We expect only one non-digit character between the 3 digit and 4 digit sections. We need to pull the matching to the right with the <code>$</code>. This way we make sure to get the very last digit in the phone number.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I'm sure there are many ways to do this, and this is only my interpretation. Have you tried Googling this to see if there's an established expression?</p>

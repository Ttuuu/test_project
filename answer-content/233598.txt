<p><a href="https://hg.ulukai.org/ecm/quine/file/eac01194cb9a/q.asm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">My equivalent</a> to your nice quine is a bit nicer, and differs in other ways.</p>

<p>It is nicer in that the payload at the end of the source is split into several lines. It still uses over-wide lines because the indentation and the blanks before comments are repeated verbatim, and each line is prefixed with a <code>db "</code> directive (the prefix) that is itself indented.</p>

<p>It differs a bit in that I only escape any <code>"</code> as <code>@</code>, and don't use any literal <code>@</code> characters in the program code or its comments. Instead, in the comments I refer to "code 40h characters", and in the code compare al to <code>40h</code>. When displaying the payload, I scan for LFs (code 10) and wrap the individual lines (excluding the literal linebreak characters) in the <em>prefix</em> and <em>suffix</em> messages.</p>

<p>My program also uses interrupt 21h function 40h instead of your mix of functions 09h and 02h. This allows me to use dollar characters <code>$</code> as literals in both the program code and the payload, which are needed to calculate string lengths in NASM without adding labels at the end of the strings.</p>

<p>I also evolved my nice quine (q.asm), first modifying only the payload to create <a href="https://hg.ulukai.org/ecm/quine/file/eac01194cb9a/halfqt.asm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">halfqt.asm</a>, and then running that to create <a href="https://hg.ulukai.org/ecm/quine/file/eac01194cb9a/qt.asm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the shorter qt.asm</a>.</p>

<p>Like your Q1:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Dropped indentation, and most comments.</p></li>
<li><p>Used shorter number bases (<code>int 33</code> etc).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Unlike your Q1:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Kept org 256 (and cpu 8086).</p></li>
<li><p>Kept using labels, though all just one letter now.</p></li>
<li><p>Kept same program logic, including the process termination call.</p></li>
<li><p>Kept the linebreak at the end of file.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, I modified the program code (but not payload) of qt.asm to create <a href="https://hg.ulukai.org/ecm/quine/file/eac01194cb9a/annotqt.asm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the annotated variant</a>. You can read this to learn in more detail about my decisions for the qt.asm variant.</p>

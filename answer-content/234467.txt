<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>a couple of things -</p>

<ol>
<li><p><code>a</code> and <code>b</code> variables which are declared in the first case statement are undeclared in the next case statements. Better to declare those outside the <code>switch case</code> block.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Divide by 0</strong>. If user enters <code>b</code> as <code>0</code> in the 4th case, it will cause <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/ub" rel="nofollow noreferrer">undefined behaviour</a> - i.e. literally anything could happen.</p></li>
<li><p>The prompt function is unindented. Its better to have indented code for readability, although it doesn't have much effect on performance.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Hope these help!</p>

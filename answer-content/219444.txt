<p>The two main datatypes for storing matrices in Python (other that the nested list that you use here) are Numpy arrays and Pandas dataframes. Both Numpy and Pandas support reading files, for instance see these links for <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3518778/how-do-i-read-csv-data-into-a-record-array-in-numpy">Numpy</a> and <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Pandas</a>. You can open a spreadsheet program such as Excel, write the values there, save it as a CSV, then read the CSV into Python.</p>

<p>If you want to input from the console, you should give some output to let the user what you're expecting them to do. As it stands, running your program results in the program just sitting there with no indication what it's waiting for. If you know what format the user will be using, you can simplify the reading quite a bit. If the user simply enters the nested list (in this case <code>[[1,3],[1,5]]</code>), then doing <code>eval</code> on it will turn it from a string to a nested list. However, doing <code>eval</code> on arbitrary input from the user is dangerous. A safer alternative is given <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1894269/convert-string-representation-of-list-to-list">here</a>.</p>

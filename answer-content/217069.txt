<p>If this is your first C program then all I can say is "Nice".</p>

<p>I modified the structure of your program slightly to make it more conventional, I created main.c which contains int main() and simpleConsoleRoutine() and world.c which has all the other functions.</p>

<p>Generally main() is going to process any command line arguments and do any setup, everything else will be in C program modules defined by a header files.</p>

<p>Suggestion, all the functions that are NOT public interfaces might be better defined as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/558122/what-is-a-static-function">static</a>. This reduces the name of functions in the global namespace and allows a function name to be reused in different modules as necessary.</p>

<p><em>Example:</em></p>

<pre><code>// Overwrites the readable cells with the writable cells
static void copyWritableToReadable(World* world) {
    memcpy(world-&gt;readCells, world-&gt;writeCells,
        sizeof(bool) * world-&gt;width * world-&gt;height);
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Header File Missing Function Declaration</strong>  </p>

<p>It would be best to add void randomizeCells(World* world, float aliveChance); to the header file, since this function is required by simpleConsoleRoutine().</p>

<p><strong>Portability</strong>  </p>

<pre><code>#pragma once may not be in the C standard and may not be portable, use guards instead

#ifndef WORLD_H
#define WORLD_H

...

#endif
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Memory Allocation and De-allocation</strong>  </p>

<pre><code>// No need to free world?
</code></pre>

<p>In this particular instance there is no need to free world, however, if simpleConsoleRoutine() was ever called in a loop there would be a memory leak, which is generally considered a bad thing when programming in C. You might want to put <code>void freeWorld(World* world)</code> into the header file and replace this comment with a call to <code>freeWorld()</code>. In this simple case it would allow you to test and debug the code.</p>

<p><strong>size_t</strong>  </p>

<p>The use of this type is correct in this application. For memory allocation or indexing through arrays this may be the best type to use.</p>

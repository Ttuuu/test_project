<p>This might actually be useful in some cases, however, we first need to get rid of its weaknesses and clean-up the code a little bit:</p>

<ul>
<li>Every property of <code>ConstrainedSetter</code> is mutable, so it can be modified by anyone, anytime. This is not good because it allows me to override your settings whenever I desire. This should definitely be immutable.</li>
<li>Both the <code>FailureCallBack</code> and <code>SuccessCallBack</code> should pass the instance of the <code>ConstrainedSetter</code> as a parameter so that one has the necessary context about what went wrong or what succeeded. The former should also pass the reason it didn't work.</li>
<li><code>ILogger</code> should not be part of this class. There are already two callbacks to handle failures and successes. Let the user handle this. Adding a logger makes it redundant.</li>
<li>Your naming convention here is exactly the other way around. Names prefixed with an <code>_</code> underscore are usually private fields and not public parameters. Similar, lowercase properties should not be public and abbreviating them to a magic <code>pc[n]m</code> is a no-go.</li>
<li>I cannot figure out what the <code>HashId</code> is for. You should document it better.</li>
</ul>

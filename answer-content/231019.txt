<p>Afew things I noticed:</p>

<p>Concatenating strings using the plus operator(<code>+</code>), is very inefficient.  Each concatenation creates a new string.  This due to strings being immutable.  Using a <code>char</code> array or the <code>StringBuilder</code> is much more efficient.</p>

<p>The variable <code>next</code> is a <code>double</code> but the value you're assigning to it is 2 ints added together.  It would make much more sense to have this as a <code>char</code>.  In fact you should declare this before the <code>if</code> block to be able to use it in each condition.</p>

<p><code>Equals</code> isn't doing what you appear to think it does.  <code>Equals</code> is for testing whether 2 objects are the same.  <code>==</code> is for testing whether 2 objects values are the same.</p>

<p>You appear to expect only lower case characters and spaces.  However you don't seem to have any mechanism for testing whether the string complies with that.</p>

<p>You can simplify getting the replacement character by using the modulus(<code>%</code>) operator. Something like this should work:  <code>newChar = (char)(((oldChar - 'a') + key) % 26) + 'a'</code></p>

<p>Your code won't work right if the string has words from a language that uses two bytes to represent one character.</p>

<p>Right now you've hardcoded the key.  It would be better to have a method that takes the string and the key as parameters.</p>

<p>well, your code looks fine, but there are few things I would like to talk about.</p>

<ul>
<li>The class names allways goes using UpperCamelCase, at least in Java it is very common.</li>
<li>Usually we have the parameter name equally named to the class attribute:</li>
</ul>

<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>void setName(String pname) {
    name = pname;//you should not. plus your IDE may have getters/setters generator
}

//use instead
void setName(String name) {
    this.name = name;//better, according to what most Java programmers are used to see
                     //however, it is no big deal. (but more work for you)
}
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>The brackets:</li>
</ul>

<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>class ceeLo
{//C++ style
}

class CeeLo {
//Java style
}
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Normally variable values are assigned in the constructor instead of directly</li>
</ul>

<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>private int[] dieValues = new int[3];//no, at least if it is not constant

//yes
public Player() {
    this.dieValues = new int[3];
}
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Finally, there:</li>
</ul>

<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>void playerRolls()
   {
      //as the method is called (and is called often)
      //the program will create and destroy these constants. so, you should declare
      //them outside the method
      final int numDie = 3;
      final int numSides = 6;

//example
private static final int numDie = 3;
private static final int numSides = 6;

void playerRolls()
   {//... use those here

</code></pre>

<p>I hope it has been helpful.</p>

<p>I agree with J H regarding most of the comments. One thing to add though: If you restructure the comments on the top of the function, you can get <a href="https://se.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/add-help-for-your-program.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>help</code></a>. This can be very helpful at times. </p>

<pre><code>myTowersOfHanoi(N, from, to, alt)
% MYTOWERSOFHANOI  Implementation of Tower Of Hanoi
% Accepts three integers: 
%  N - number of disks  
%  from - number of start tower
%  to - number of end tower 
%  alt - free tower. 
% Displays string outputs with successive moves to complete the task of solving
% the Towers of Hanoi with N disks moved from tower with number stored
% in the second argument to one with number in third arg.

<p>You don't need the dot when adding numbers a number to a vector / array. Use <code>M = M + 1;</code> instead of <code>M = M .+ 1;</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p><code>NaN</code> can take arguments, so <code>M = NaN * zeros(1, n);</code> is simply <code>M = NaN(1, N)</code>.</p>

<p>I'd avoid it all and do <code>M = zeros(1, n)</code>, and then skip the <code>else</code> part in the loop below. </p>

<p>I might come back to this and add more later on, but I don't have more time now.</p>

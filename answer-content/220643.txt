<p>Composition over inheritance. You have a base class GameObject which only does collision and bounding box type stuff. There is no need for it to be a base class that you inherit from. </p>

<p>Make it a member variable instead and access it when you need to. Adding gravity to the ball and moving the platform in response to keyboard doesn't need virtual functions.</p>

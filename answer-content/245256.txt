<h2>Externalize your DML</h2>
<p>Given the length of the query written in <code>GetArticleChangesAsync</code>, I would expect that either</p>
<ul>
<li>it be moved to a stored procedure (common but IMO overkill); or</li>
<li>moved to a view (my usual preference given read-only queries like this).</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several reasons for this, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a DBA, they will have more control over the fine-grained details of the query</li>
<li>The query is by its nature more closely coupled to the database design than the application design</li>
<li>It will be often easier to update a view than rebuild and redeploy the entire application</li>
</ul>

<p>A couple of things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I wouldn't do this in the <code>after_commit</code> handler. If you do it before the commit then an error here would cause the whole transaction to fail whereas doing it after committing could potentially result in an inconsistent database.</p></li>
<li><p>You also want to update the library when a <code>destroy</code> happens which you currently doing. Even though it looks like you are using soft deletion I would consider it a good idea to cover all your bases.</p></li>
<li><p><code>books.available.exists?</code> usually performs a little better than <code>books.available.present?</code> in this situation. (Because I can almost guarantee from experience that you are going to completely destroy bad data manually for some reason)</p></li>
<li><p>If you are need to optimize for performance you might want to check <code>if destroyed? || deleted_changed?</code> before running the query. </p></li>
<li><p>Additionally you could be more intelligent and factor in the value of the <code>deleted</code> flag on the current record. i.e. if it is false then you can make the library active without running a second query. </p></li>
</ul>

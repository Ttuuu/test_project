<p>Your code uses an algorithm that directly tests for an overlap of time spans, but a simpler algorithm is to check for a non-overlap - to check for whether the time-spans are completely distinct. The spans are distinct if the first span starts after the other ends, or ends before the other one starts. This test is easy. The spans overlap if they are not distinct, so you can negate the logic for the <code>isThereOverlap</code> method.</p>

<pre><code>private static boolean isThereOverlap(Interval t1, Interval t2) {
    return !(t1.end.isBefore(t2.begin) || t1.begin.isAfter(t2.end));
}
</code></pre>

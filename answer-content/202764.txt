<p>Consistency is key when you're naming things. You have <code>counter</code>, <code>CountOfCreditCards</code> and a method called <code>GetCountOfExpiredCreditCards</code>. Your method is named perfectly but the other two are less precise. Try to be consistent. </p>

<p>Did you know about read-only auto properties? That would get rid of your counter field:</p>

<pre><code>public int CountOfExpiredCreditCards { get; }

private User()
{
    creditCards = new List&lt;CreditCard&gt;();
    CountOfExpiredCreditCards = GetCountOfExpiredCreditCards();
}
</code></pre>

<p>I would argue that it's fine to just calculate the count on demand by making the method public and removing the property entirely.</p>

<p>You also use <code>DateTime.Now</code> which is the system <em>local</em> time. Timezones and DateTime handling are a very deep rabbit hole so just be aware that generally speaking, you would want to use <code>DateTime.UtcNow</code>, <code>DateTimeOffset</code>, or a third party like Noda Time's <code>ZonedDateTime</code>.</p>

<p>As an aside, you have the <code>counter</code> field as static. That means it's shared between all instances of <code>User</code> which is almost certainly not what you want.</p>

  <p>I have used Postgres's arrays to build a system to avoid joins. NB. I'm not using proper keys at the moment for simplicity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One person's simplicity is another person's denormalized nightmare. Are you avoiding joins because of some already-analysed performance rationale? If so, fine. But if it's based on superstition, this is probably premature optimization.</p>

<p>All of that is to say, the "traditional" normalized relational approach to this would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <code>user</code> table with an integer primary key</li>
<li>A <code>food</code> table with an integer primary key</li>
<li>A <code>meal</code> table with an integer primary key</li>
<li>A <code>preference</code> table with foreign keys to <code>user</code>, <code>food</code> and <code>meal</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Don't be afraid of <code>join</code>. Or if you are, consider using a denormalized or "tabular" database like Mongo.</p>

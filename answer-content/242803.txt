<p>Check out the pyinputplus module. It's good for when you are asking for specific user input, such as when you want the user to answer with 'yes' or 'no', or in your case, 'X' or 'O'.</p>

<p>So in that case you would do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>from pyinputplus import *

inputChoice(('X', 'O'))
</code></pre>

<p>Which will return:</p>

<pre><code>Please select one of: X, O
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, as a second argument for inputChoice(), you can enter a string for the prompt:</p>

<pre><code>from pyinputplus import *

inputChoice(('X', 'O'), 'Please enter your letter: X or O)
</code></pre>

<p>Which will return:</p>

<pre><code>Please enter your letter: X or O
</code></pre>

<p>The input will act as a while loop until one of the provided choices are input(typecase is not taken into account by default, though I think this can be changed within the function's arguments). If an invalid choice is input, the code will return (assuming your input was 'x')</p>

<pre><code>'x' is not a valid choice.
</code></pre>

<p>pyinputplus and its various functions are great when requiring specific user input, as it keeps you from having to have a bunch of if/elif/else statements under a while loop. It saves a lot of time.</p>

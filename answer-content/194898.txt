<p>Others have pointed out a fix you could make to your implementation.  But there is a way to write this which is much simpler.  That takes advantage of a simplified definition of palindrome: "a word which reads the same forwards and backwards".</p>

<p>Now I haven't done PHP in years, and don't have a test environment, so this might have issues, but the basic idea should be clear.</p>

<pre><code>public static function isPalindrome($word)
{
    return $word == strrev($word);
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>Based on suggestions in the comments, this would be nicer:</p>

<pre><code>function isPalindrome($word) {
    $word = preg_replace('/[^a-zA-Z]/', '', $word);
    $word = strtolower($word);
    return $word == strrev($word);
}
</code></pre>

<p>That will now correctly identify "Level" (ignoring capitalization) and "Madam, I'm Adam." (ignoring spaces and punctuation.)</p>
    </div>

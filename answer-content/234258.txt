<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>The code you first wrote is easy to follow but is quite detailed, therefore it is not easy to see what's going on.</p>

<p>To improve this, you could define some helper subs to reduce the amound of typing. For example:</p>

<pre class="lang-vb prettyprint-override"><code>Sub SetColorAndText(byval index as Integer, byval color as ???, byval text as String)
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>This simple sub already captures most of the repetition that is going on.</p>

<p>Alternatively, can you achieve the same result using the standard conditional formatting feature? That might be simpler overall.</p>

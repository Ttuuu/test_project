<p>1) where is the 'compare' function? 2) The prototype for the quicksort() function is missing that parameter </p>

<p>the posted code, (at best) can only handle an array of integers. I.E. it will not handle an array of struct nor an array of strings, etc.</p>

<p>regarding: printf("Enter the elements :"); scanf("%d",&amp;n); this fails to inform the user that the first number to be entered is actually the number of following numbers.</p>

<p>the code does not work!</p>

<p>Here is a typical run of the posted code:</p>

<pre><code>Enter the elements :3
1:3
2:2
3:1
3 2 1 
</code></pre>

<p>Then the posted code maxes out a CPU and never gets done with the sorting.</p>

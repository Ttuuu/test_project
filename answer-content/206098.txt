<p>This code is not correct. You cannot tell if the shape is a square, by only assessing the angles. All squares and rectangles have four angles of 90 degrees. And a square is a rectangle.</p>

<p>You will need At least two angles (both need to be 90 degrees) AND the length of three sides (all three need to be the same) to determine if the shape is a square. (And off course the confirmation that there are only four angles in total. I assume that you take this implicitly.)</p>

<p>For now, you can only determine if it is a rectangle. And you don't even need all four corners for it. If three out of four angles are 90 degrees, the fourth one will be 90 degrees as well.</p>

<pre><code>if (first == 90 &amp;&amp; second == 90 &amp;&amp; third == 90)
    Console.WriteLine("Rectangle. Maybe even a square");
else
    Console.WriteLine("Not a square nor a rectangle");
</code></pre>

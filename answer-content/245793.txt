<p>what methods should be used when writing similar code in the future. Thanks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I recommend taking a more <code>declarative</code> approach.  It's more concise, and easier to read.  As explained <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/imperative-vs-declarative-javascript" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>imperative code</em> is where you explicitly spell out each step of how you want something done, whereas with <em>declarative code</em> you merely say what it is that you want done. In modern JavaScript, that most often boils down to preferring some of the late-model methods of Array and Object over loops with bodies that do a lot of comparison and state-keeping.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>const sumAll = (a, b) =&gt; {
  const [from, to] = [a, b].sort();
  return ([from, to].some(n =&gt; typeof n != 'number' || n &lt; 0))
    ? 'ERROR'
    : new Array(to - from + 1)
      .fill()
      .map((_, i) =&gt; from + i)
      .reduce((sum, n) =&gt; !(sum += n) || sum);
}
</code></pre>

<h1>Class Names that are Plural</h1>

<p>I don't know if it's a convention, but for example the <code>java.util</code> package contains two or more classes like<code>Arrays</code> and <code>Collections</code> that only provide<code>static</code> util methods.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cs.uct.ac.za/mit_notes/software/htmls/ch05s09.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">UML</a> recommends that class names be written in singular.</p>

<h1>Variable Scope</h1>

<p>The scope of the <code>List &lt;Unit&gt; units</code> field is tied to its class and should be understood in its context.</p>

<p>If you renamed it to <code>collection</code> because of the context, it is still clear that it contains all the units. It even has an advantage: If you rename your class from <code>Units</code> to <code>Chunks</code>, you do not have to touch the variable <code>collection</code> because it do not follow the <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/code-smells/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Type Embedded in Name</a> code smell any more.</p>

<hr>

<p>I name my Collection-Classes with a <code>Collection</code>-suffix: <code>UnitCollection</code>. But I know that <code>Units</code> sounds and looks cooler :P</p>

<p>But its only a naming problem inside one class - feel free to choose what fits best for you</p>

<p>I'm not sure what is your final goal is, but doing that in triggers usually are not the best solution and they are not recommended to be used. By saying that I mean that there are situation when triggers can help you, but you need to use them with caution as there are quite a lot of troubles that triggers can bring if they are used wrongly.</p>

<p>Once again as I do not know what is the actual goal, I'll ask first before help you with a trigger. If the goal is to show the list with that text on UI, or track some kind of status, then I would suggest to join the tables and get the desired output. Maybe create a view (dbo.vMyOrders or any other name) and get the needed output, for example:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT m.id, 
       m.ref_num, 
       mj.job_id, 
       req_cert 
       + IIF(mt.value IS NOT NULL, ' ' + job_message, '') AS cert_status 
FROM   dbo.myorders m 
       LEFT JOIN dbo.mytypes mt 
              ON mt.value = m.req_cert 
                 AND mt.type = 'MyCerts' 
       LEFT JOIN dbo.myjobs mj 
              ON mj.job_id = m.ref_num 
WHERE  ref_type = 'J' 
       AND ref_num IS NOT NULL
       AND job_message NOT LIKE '% %'
</code></pre>

<p>If you still need trigger then:</p>

<pre><code> CREATE TRIGGER [dbo].[UpdateCert] 
    ON [dbo].[MyOrders]
    FOR UPDATE
    AS
        SET NOCOUNT ON

        IF (NOT UPDATE ([req_cert])
            AND NOT UPDATE ([ref_num]))
           RETURN

     UPDATE j
     SET job_message = req_cert + IIF(mt.value IS NOT NULL,' ' + job_message, '')
     FROM dbo.MyJobs j
     join inserted m on j.job_id = m.ref_num   
     LEFT JOIN dbo.MyTypes mt ON mt.value = m.req_cert AND mt.type = 'MyCerts'
     WHERE  ref_type = 'J' 
       AND ref_num IS NOT NULL
       AND job_message NOT LIKE '% %'
</code></pre>
    </div>

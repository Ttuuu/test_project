<p>Your code seems really nice to me.  It is well structured, and the use of ranges and concepts increase its diagnosing ability.</p>

<p>As I mentioned in my comment, <code>std::optional</code> is really a C++17 thing.  You tagged your question <a href="/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b14" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'c++14'" rel="tag">c++14</a>, so I will assume you want implement it under C++14.</p>

<p>Here's some suggestions on the code.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Your code is missing a trailing <code>}</code> to end the namespace <code>fub</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider wrapping your utility into a header.  Add include guards.</p></li>
<li><p>The conversion operator to <code>bool</code> should be marked <code>explicit</code>.  This still allows it to be <em>contextually converted</em> to <code>bool</code>, but not otherwise implicitly converted in undesired situations.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So, you would like to know if your code is <em>"following the Single Responsibility
SOLID principle"</em>. <em>S.O.L.I.D.</em> stand for <em>Single responsibility</em>,
<em>Open-closed principle</em>, <em>Liskov substitution principle</em>, <em>Interface segregation</em>
and <em>Dependency Inversion</em>.</p>
<h2>Single responsibility</h2>
<p><em>One class have a single responsibility</em>. But both <code>Payroll</code> and <code>Employees</code> are
mixing business logic, IOs and datas.</p>
<h2>Open-closed principle</h2>
<p><em>Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification</em>. This is not
easily applicable in your case.</p>
<p>Try to implement different way to compute the payroll.</p>
<h2>Liskov substitution</h2>
<p><em>Classes should be replaceable with subtypes</em>. This one is not applicable because
there are no inheritance in your code.</p>
<h2>Interface segregation</h2>
<p><em>Client should not depend on interfaces they don't use</em>. Like for the previous,
this one is not easily applicable in a small system.</p>
<h2>Dependency Inversion</h2>
<p><em>Depend on abstraction</em>. Once again, this is not easily applicable in a small
system. But one way will be to pass your <code>Employees</code> to <code>Payroll</code> instead of
creating the instance. By doing that you can easily imagine to have another
implementation of your <code>Employess</code>.</p>
<hr>
<p>You also want some tips on formatting but you are already using <code>printf</code>. However
your column are still missaligned due to different name length.</p>
<p>One solution would be to compute the minimum length of your columns to build the
formatting pattern.</p>

<h1>Avoid <code>using namespace std</code></h1>

<p>The standard namespace isn't designed to be imported wholesale, and name collisions could later appear that silently change the meaning of your program (such as when you add an extra include, or move to a newer C++ standard).</p>

<h1><code>std::string::insert</code> moves content multiple times</h1>

<p>We're not very efficient, because the later characters will be shuffled as many times as there are preceding commas inserted.  Worse, we don't even <code>reserve()</code> enough space to add the commas, so there could (theoretically at least) be multiple memory allocations.</p>

<h1>Don't reinvent the wheel</h1>

<p>It would be simpler and more flexible to use <code>std::numpunct</code> to perform the formatting.</p>

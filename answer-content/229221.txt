<p>Your code can be simplified using a simple loop, eliminating most of the duplicated code:</p>

<pre><code>def game_of_cups(zipcode, rules):

    total_points = 0

    for num, rule in enumerate(rules, 1):
        rule_passes = rule(zipcode)
        points = num + 4 if rule_passes else 0
        total_points += points
        print(f"Rule {num} got {points} points, so total is now {total_points}")

    print(f"{zipcode} got {total_points} points!")
</code></pre>

<p>You just need the appropriate rule functions, like:</p>

<pre><code>def rule1(zipcode):
    return zipcode[0] == zipcode[-1]

def rule2(zipcode):
    a, b, c, d, e = map(int, zipcode)
    return b * 2 &gt; a and c &gt; min(b, d)

... etc ...
</code></pre>

<p>And then a list of <code>rules</code> to pass to the game:</p>

<pre><code>rules = [ rule1, rule2, rule3, rule4, rule5, rule6, rule7 ]
</code></pre>

<p>Feel free to name the functions more appropriately; they don’t need to be named <code>rule#</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Are you missing a rule?  You said there were 8 rules. </p>

<hr>

<p>Your implementation of rule#2 doesn’t match the comment description of rule #2.  I think it should be <code>b == a * 2</code>, not <code>b * 2 &gt; a</code>.</p>

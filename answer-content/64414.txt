<p>Just commenting on ... the comments in the source (sorry): I think they add a lot of noise, and don't provide any improved clarity (in this case). They're mostly restating what the following line of code obviously does, or repeating what a variable name already describes.</p>

<p>Such comments "by habbit" are actually harmful, as they have no benefit and could prevent authors from making the code clear in the first place.</p>

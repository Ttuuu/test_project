<h3>Lambdas Too Complex</h3>

<p>You say that the reason behind your lambdas is that they carry a lot of state around, but it is mutating plenty of it as well.  Extracting your lambdas into methods in their own right would make it easier to keep track of where your state is used and where it is mutated.</p>

<h3>Methods Should Calculate Or Mutate, Not Both</h3>

<p>Lambdas that calculate something and then mutate something else are notoriously difficult to debug and maintain.  When you create your methods, it should either calculate something (such as the atomic weight) or change something (such as changing your state).</p>

<h3>Variable Names Unclear</h3>

<p>Names like <code>pstart</code>, <code>num</code> and <code>m</code> do not tell me anything about the purpose of these variables.  There is nothing wrong with <code>LongVariableNamesThatExplainWhatTheyAreDoing</code>.</p>

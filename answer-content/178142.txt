<p>In all programming language, it is better that a function's name is a verb, or start with a verb. In your case, I would use <code>create_result()</code> instead of <code>creating_result()</code>.</p>

<p>One this transformation is done, you would think of a better name for this function as it is quite too generic in its meaning. <code>create_car()</code> would be better and more meaningful in your context.</p>

<p>For the parameters you are passing, they should be written following the <code>snake_name</code> convention. Meaning, for example, <code>carColour</code> becomes <code>car_color</code>, <code>carPrice</code> becomes <code>car_price</code>, ... and so on.</p>

<p><strong>More</strong> important: Regardless of the purpose of the parameters you are passing to the <code>creating_result()</code> function, their number is quite much which thing should lead to creating a class and use them as instance attributes.</p>

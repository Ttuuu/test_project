<p>There is no need to implement <code>stringEqual</code> yourself. Use <code>strcmp(a, b) == 0</code> instead.</p>
<p>For all variables that contain memory sizes, you should use <code>size_t</code> instead of <code>int</code>.</p>
<p>In C, the function <code>strlen</code> is terribly slow since it has to scan the entire string for the terminating <code>'\0'</code>. Never use <code>strlen</code> in a loop for the same string.</p>
<p>Bug: as soon as your word list contains non-ASCII words, your code runs into undefined behavior (array index out of bounds). The code should be able to work for Arabic and Cyrillic as well. I don't know how Koreans play Hangman, that might be interesting as well.</p>

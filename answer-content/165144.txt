<p>A proposal for improvement and an associated possible enhancement:</p>

<p>The constant <code>8</code> appears in many places as the number of characters to be output on each line.  It could do with a meaningful name, so its intent is clear and it can be changed with a single edit.</p>

<p>The enhancement opportunity should now be obvious - allow <code>chars_per_line</code> to be specified by the caller somehow.</p>

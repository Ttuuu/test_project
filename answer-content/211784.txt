<p>It seems like there is a defect with how the terms are searched. When you use a word that shows up in an answer and not the question, the answer is replaced in each subsequent answers.</p>

<p>For example, try searching for the word "test".</p>

<p><strong>Cat1 - Title1</strong> will open up and show the answer. However, if you now expand <strong>Cat1 - Title2</strong>, it will contain the answer from <strong>Title1</strong>.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot for the thorough explanation and analysis!</p>

<p>I tried your suggestion for updating the 'get-highlighted-text-by-key' method, unfortunately, it didn't work right away though. I managed to make it work like so:</p>

<pre><code>(defn get-highlighted-text-by-key [item filterTerm key]
  (if-let [match (re-matches (re-pattern (str "(?i)(.*)(" filterTerm ")(.*)"))
                          (apply str (get item key)))]
      ;; drops the first element of the match vector, since that's the whole string
      (let [nested-title (for [substr (drop 1 match)]
                           (if (= (simplify-string substr) (simplify-string filterTerm))
                             [:span {:class "highlight"} substr]
                             [:span substr]
                             )
                           )]
        nested-title)
      [:span (get item key "No title specified")]))
</code></pre>

<p>This is also way simpler and makes more sense. When I wrote the method I had the feeling that something is off, but I couldn't quite wrap my head around it. So thanks for clearing that up!</p>

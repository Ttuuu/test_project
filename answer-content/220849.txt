<p>Your unit tests contain no assertions about the behavior of your code, so they prove nothing other than that the code does not crash in this specific situation. These are commonly referred to as <em>smoke tests</em>.</p>

<p>There are three critical elements for any unit test, even before you start thinking about the overall coverage of your application's code paths:</p>

<ol>
<li>Control environment and set up test data.</li>
<li>Execute functionality.</li>
<li>Validate results.</li>
</ol>

<p>You are only doing (1) and (2) so far.</p>

<p>I'd recommend reviewing Salesforce Stack Exchange's canonical QA, <a href="https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/questions/244788/how-do-i-write-an-apex-unit-test/244789#244789">How do I write an Apex unit test?</a>, for more information and resources.

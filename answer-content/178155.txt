<p>Your whole code can be rewritten as:</p>

<pre><code>if __name__ == "__main__":
    # test 1st caller
    my_dict = {}
    my_dict.update(carPrice=1, carColour="red")
    print "my_dict is ", my_dict

    # test 2nd caller
    my_dict = {}
    my_dict.update(carSpeed="200", carType="SUV", carPrice=300)
    print "my_dict is ", my_dict
</code></pre>

<p>Which seems to be what you actually want :)</p>

<p>Besides the points raised by @Billal already, I don't understand why you are creating dicts that hold one item under the key "thekey". Can you elaborate on the idea behind that? I feel you might have misunderstood something here.</p>

<p>Thinking about this more, maybe it's even simpler and you only want to initialize the dicts like so:</p>

<pre><code>if __name__ == "__main__":
    # test 1st caller
    my_dict = dict(carPrice=1, carColour="red")
    print "my_dict is ", my_dict

    # test 2nd caller
    my_dict = dict(carSpeed="200", carType="SUV", carPrice=300)
    print "my_dict is ", my_dict
</code></pre>
    </div>

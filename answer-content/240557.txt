<p>Move the query logic to different class, let's call it DAL for example. In this implementation you are returning DataTable.  Returning a list of some class instead will make sure changes in the DB query/ schema will not affect the GUI but only the DAL class. </p>

<p><strong>LINQ</strong></p>

<p>You can write the sql query using linq and then if you have syntax errors they will be cache during completion</p>

<p><strong>Grid</strong></p>

<p>I wonder why  you set the columns headers multiple times?</p>

<p>Think about this scenario: when the form loads, If the query return 0 results or there is a connection problem, how the grid will look like? </p>

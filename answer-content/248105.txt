<p>I've been trying to solve same problem with python and I think I've figured out a way that covers all the cases that are possible given the mathematical definition of an odd number. I've tested it and it works, I wonder what do you think.</p>
<pre><code>counter = 0
odd = []

while counter &lt; 10:
  x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    if abs(x)%2 != 0:
      odd.append(x)
  counter += 1

 if len(odd) == 0:
   print("No odd number was entered")
 else:
   print("The largest odd number is:", max(odd))
</code></pre>
    </div>

<p>Using batch-inserting is one of the methods to decrease a saving time, but still not enough to handle 100k records in 5 or less seconds due to ORM internal mechanism. I suggest you to look into your MySQL DB and use its capabilities. Try to tune your DB tables engine, by default it's set to InnoDB.</p>

<p>InnoDB is a pretty good engine. However, it's recommended to be 'tuned'. In case of unordered PM key inserting, the engine can take a bit longer time than MyISAM. This can be easily overcome by setting a higher value for <em>innodb_buffer_pool_size</em>.</p>

<p>Anyway I would suggest to use <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/load-data.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>LOAD DATA INFILE</code></a> syntax so that MySQL can perfectly manage CSV files.</p>

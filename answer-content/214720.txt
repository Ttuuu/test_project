<p>You are focusing on the wrong portion of the problem.  You're thinking the array needs to be rotated.  The output of the array needs to be "rotated" but the array can remain as-is.</p>

<p>So simply write a loop that starts at the middle of the array, incrementing until it hits the end, and then continues along from the beginning until it hits the index just before the one you started at.</p>

<p>The output of that loop is the "rotated" array, from the visibility of the testing framework.</p>

<pre><code>    string sep = "";
    for (int i = d % a.Length; i &lt; a.Length; i++) {
        Console.Write(sep);
        Console.Write(a[i]);
        sep = " ";
    }
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; d % a.Length; i++)
    {
        Console.Write(sep);
        Console.Write(a[i]);
        sep = " ";
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This is a great reason why you should sometimes see <code>hackerrank</code> as a poor place to really learn programming.  </p>

<p><code>hackerrank</code> primarily contains programming problems harvested from programming competitions.  Competitions where these problems are meant to be solved fast, with a time deadline.  This means that the problems are more about building a quick, clever, solution and less about really learning the lessons that would help you in a programming career.</p>

<p>Another example of a solution is</p>

<pre><code>    string sep = "";
    for (int i = d; a.Length + d - i &gt; 0; i++) {
        Console.Write(sep);
        Console.Write(a[i % a.Length]);
        sep = " ";
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Which is, according to <code>hackerrank</code>s estimation, "just as good" as the above solution, but is far less readable.</p>

<p>URL's are a nightmare to process. Even though, in your case, it appears that you can use regex to isolate your specific problem, I would still recommend that you avoid regex for URL manipulation.</p>

<p>PHP has native URL parsing methods (much better tested and controlled than your code), and you should use them where possible. Have a look at <a href="https://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.parse-url.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the parse_url documentation</a>. You can use this, as well as some of the other example code on that page to parse, and rebuild the URL with the changed parameters.</p>

<p>Using 'native' functions where possible is often the best solution. Even though the native function does not do the entirety of what you want done, it goes a long way to simplifying the process, and the regexes become more manageable. In this case, I think it is the right solution too.</p>

<p>Assuming the requirement was to maintain initial map as immutable object -- just a few concerns re those <code>new</code> statements in sorting. They violate SRP, at least. Either accept already created (mutable) to populate with results, or (I prefer) accept a factory to get one. Same apples to collection step in filtering.</p>

<p>If, however, it is given that input map can be mutated during the process, then whole solution should be written with this in mind and, perhaps, stream is not the right choice here.</p>

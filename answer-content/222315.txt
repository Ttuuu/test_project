<p>It's been a while since I wrote VBA, but I seem to remember <code>Application.Calculation = xlCalculationManual</code> often sped up my programs considerably. This prevents formulae from being evaluated while you're updating cell values, and can be reversed via <code>Application.Calculation = xlCalculationAutomatic</code>.</p>

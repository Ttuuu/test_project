<p>First - you are expected to provide complete and working code. To fully understand your code <code>month_aware_time_stamp</code> is missing (I'll try to guess what it probably returns).</p>

<p>Second - I think your approach and your class <code>Location</code> is broken by design. Also the implementation is a mess but let's stick to the design first. What your class does</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; item1 = Location(1510213074679, 286220203, 772454413, 1414, None, None, None, 78, None)
&gt;&gt;&gt; item2 = Location(1510213074679, 286220203, 772454413, 5, 6, 80, 226, None, None)
&gt;&gt;&gt; item1 == item2
True
</code></pre>

<p>This is weird behavior. Nobody would expect that. Your code is not maintainable and will cause surprising behavior when being maintained.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you do not need all the other attributes - do not store them at all. Just store the attributes you want to compare and do your stuff without strange hash implementations</p></li>
<li><p>If you need all that attributes in your class, then your implementation will render the class useless for any other use. Do not overwrite the comparison behavior but either extract the relevant data to a second data structure (tuple, ...) or provide an external comparison function for calling functions like <code>sort()</code>. You can always do comprehension to extract relevant attributes to a tuple</p></li>
</ul>

<p>.</p>

<pre><code>some_set = {(s.latitude, s.longitude, s.year, s.month) for s in x}
</code></pre>

<p>or you immediately count with <code>collections.Counter</code></p>

<pre><code>import collections
c = collections.Counter((s.latitude, s.longitude, s.year, s.month) for s in x)
</code></pre>

<p>I will skip the review of the concrete implementetion as the design has to change. But</p>

<ul>
<li>never implement some homebrew hash if the builtin <code>hash()</code> is sufficient.</li>
<li>if you think you have to implement <code>__hash__()</code> and/or `<strong>eq</strong>() please follow the guidelines in [<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__%5D" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.<strong>hash</strong>]</a></li>
<li>never keep hash values unless you can guarantee consistency</li>
</ul>

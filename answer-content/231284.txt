<h1>Imports</h1>

<p>I notice you import <code>re</code> <em>three</em> times, once for each password check function. Why?  Just import the library once at the top of the file, and you can use it in all of your functions.</p>

<h1>Returning Booleans</h1>

<p>Instead of returning <code>True</code> or <code>False</code> based on the result of the expression, simply return the expression. It results to a boolean anyway, so returning <code>True</code> and <code>False</code> is unnecessary; just return the expression.</p>

<h1>DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)</h1>

<p>You have three functions that essentially perform the same task, just with <em>very slightly</em> different function calls. You can compress these regex checks into one method. Then you can pass what type of check you want to perform on the password. See below.</p>

<pre><code>import re

def strong_password_check(password: str, type_of_check: str) -&gt; bool:
    """
    Accepts a password and the type of check to perform on the password

    :param password: Password to check
    :param type_of_check: How to check the password. Has to be "match", "search", or "findall"

    """
    regex = r'^(?!.*([a-z])\1\1)(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[0-9])[A-Za-z0-9]{6,20}$'
    if type_of_check == "match":
        return re.match(regex, password) is not None
    if type_of_check == "search":
        return re.search(regex, password) is not None
    if type_of_check == "findall":
        return re.findall(regex, password) != []
</code></pre>

<h1>Test Cases</h1>

<p>Not really sure the usefulness of red and green apples. Again, importing <code>cProfile</code> and <code>timeit</code> should go at the top of the program.</p>

<p>I see you're checking for performance, but not for the actual strength of the password. Would your program agree that <code>Password123</code> is a good password? Any security professional worth his salt wouldn't agree.</p>

<p>I suggest that you use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Kolmgorov Complexity</a> to check the strength of the password.</p>

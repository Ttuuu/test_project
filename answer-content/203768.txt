<p>Nice work! You might also be interested in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/26218704/562769">Matplotlib histogram with collection bin for high values</a>.</p>

<p>I like the ascii-art explanation :-)</p>

<p>Things I see that could improve the code:</p>

<ul>
<li>Put the histogram building in a function. This way others can import it / use it / copy-paste it more easily. Then it also becomes clearer what is the required input (data) and what are parameters that could be set by default (<code>K</code>, <code>bins</code>, <code>title</code>).</li>
<li>The name <code>center</code> is misleading. It is a list. And in fact those are the bins. So I would call it <code>bins</code>, overwriting the old value.</li>
<li>Instead of <code>newhist</code> you could call it <code>bin_values</code> or <code>bin_heights</code>.</li>
</ul>

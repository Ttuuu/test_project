<p>I have managed to solve the problem on my own. the problem was int the AssignPlayerInput() and the AlternateInput(). let me explain what was happening</p>

<p>each frame the value of repFor was either "K" or "C" after which the AssignPlayerInput() would use that value to check input the frame which meant if I tried to press a K type input and a C type input only one of those would get detected depending on value of repFor So I changed my code so it would check for both K and C in a single Frame.</p>

<p>here is my latest code and AssignPlayerInput() is called every frame</p>

<pre><code>void AssignPlayerInput()
    {
        for (int unAssignedPlayer = 0; unAssignedPlayer &lt; playerOrderString.Count; unAssignedPlayer++)
        {
            if (playerOrderString[unAssignedPlayer] == "notSelected")
            {

                CheckInputFor("K", 2, unAssignedPlayer);
                CheckInputFor("C", 4, unAssignedPlayer);
            }
        }
    }
    void CheckInputFor(string repFor, int times, int unAssignedPlayer)
    {
        for (int input = 0; input &lt; times; input++)
        {
            string playerOrderVale = repFor + (input + 1);
            string playerThisTime = "Fire1" + playerOrderVale;
            if ((Input.GetButtonDown(playerThisTime)) &amp;&amp; (playerOrderString[unAssignedPlayer] == "notSelected"))
            {
                if (CheckRepetedValue(playerThisTime))
                {
                    return;
                }
                else
                {
                    playerOrderString[unAssignedPlayer] = playerOrderVale;
                    return;
                }
            }
        }
    }

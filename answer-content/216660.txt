<p>One thing to do, is to create a lookup table for the float H = exp(-beta*dE) . As your change in energy can only take 4 different values, it is more efficient to store the result of the above exponential for each of those 4 values, and then access it via an index instead of calculating it everytime. (You will actually only need 2 of those values.)</p>

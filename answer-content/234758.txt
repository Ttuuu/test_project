<p>You have lots of global variables. That works for a one-off program, but if you ever want to package your functionality into a library or so, you need to rewrite this to put them into the main program. Might as well do so immediately. (In particular your "dijkstra" function should return an explicit result. Not be void and work on a global variable.)</p>

<p>You declare a couple of large static arrays. 1. That's wasteful for smaller problems. 2. Your program will crash if you try something larger. 3. You are putting them on the stack so this runs into problems if your OS limits the stack size. Conclusion: please make them dynamic. std::vector is great for this. That also prevents you from having lots of "magic numbers" in your code.</p>

<p>"if(visited[destination] == true)" You know that that's the same as 
<code>if(visited[destination])</code>?</p>

<p>Algorithm optimizations? If you implemented it correctly it'll probably be fine.</p>

<p>Specific suggestions:</p>

<ol>
<li>All t abbr mks th c hard 2 rd. Plz repl abbrs w/full wrds. Think of variable names as comments – they don't matter at all to the computer, but they do matter to anybody reading the code. A good rule of thumb is that if any of your comments explain <em>what</em> is coming up rather than <em>why</em> it was done like that, you can probably replace the comment with more elegant code. I've been working over a year with some colleagues on a medium-size new system, and we've taken this approach to heart: about 0.5% of the lines in Python files have comments on them.</li>
<li>Conversions often take a lot of time, especially on a lot of items, and even more especially in a loop. Working with <em>only</em> lists or <em>only</em> tuples might speed up things a bit. In terms of readability, tuples are generally used when there is a fixed number of items, often of different types. Neither of these seem to apply to this code.</li>
<li>The contents of the function can probably be split into at least three more for readability:

<ol>
<li>validation,</li>
<li>mode handling, and</li>
<li>the loop contents.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The modes could be related as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Enum</code></a> values:</p>

<pre><code>class Mode(Enum):
    FULL = "full"
    VALID = "valid"
    SAME = "same"

def …(…, mode: Mode = Mode.FULL):
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>General suggestions:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ambv/black" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>black</code></a> can automatically format your code to be more idiomatic.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>isort</code></a> can group and sort your imports automatically.</li>
<li><p><a href="https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>flake8</code></a> with a strict complexity limit will give you more hints to write idiomatic Python:</p>

<pre><code>[flake8]
max-complexity = 4
ignore = W503,E203
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>I would then recommend adding <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">type hints</a> everywhere and validating them using a strict <a href="https://github.com/python/mypy" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>mypy</code></a> configuration:</p>

<pre><code>[mypy]
check_untyped_defs = true
disallow_untyped_defs = true
ignore_missing_imports = true
no_implicit_optional = true
warn_redundant_casts = true
warn_return_any = true
warn_unused_ignores = true
</code></pre></li>

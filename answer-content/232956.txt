<p>For simplicity I have just used variables to assign a user name and password. You should never hard code this, instead use a dictionary file <code>with open</code> that compares the key username to the value password for simple storage. If you want a more creative way to store and gather the information you can use an encrypted database such as <a href="https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">SQlCipher</a>. You do not need to account for every instance of what an input is, you can just use an <code>else</code> clause if the credentials are not correct.</p>

<pre><code>user_name = 'admin'
pwd = 'password'

def login():
  while True:
    try:
      i = input('Enter username:&gt; ')
      if i == user_name:
        p = input('Enter password:&gt; ')
        if p == pwd:
          print('FUNCTION TO GAME HERE')
          break # whatever your game function is
        else:
          print('Wrong password')
      else:
        print('User does not exist')
    except ValueError:
      print('Invalid')

login()
</code></pre>

<p>Your code gives hints to what the password or user name is. This defeats the object of keeping the information safe with as little possibility that it is going to be guessed.  </p>

<p>Output: </p>

<pre><code>Enter username:&gt; a
User does not exist
Enter username:&gt; 1
User does not exist
Enter username:&gt; admin
Enter password:&gt; p
Wrong password
Enter username:&gt; admin
Enter password:&gt; password
FUNCTION TO GAME HERE
</code></pre>

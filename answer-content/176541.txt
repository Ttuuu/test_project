<p>You have defined the variable <code>formmodified</code> as a global variable. This means that it can be modified from anywhere using the code <code>window.formmodified = "yes"</code>. If you don't want that, you have to <em>declare</em> a local variable at the beginning of your code:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {
    var formmodified = 0;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>var</code> makes the difference between the global and the local variable.</p>

<p>Since the variable takes only two values, these values should be <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> instead of 1 and 0. This also makes checking this condition simpler:</p>

<pre><code>if (formmodified) { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>That reads much more natural than your current code.</p>

<p>Instead of defining the same action on three jQuery selectors, you can combine them into one:</p>

<pre><code>$("input[name='ModifyRecord'], input[name='DeleteRecord'], input[name='DeleteChecked']").click(function() {
    formmodified = false;
});
</code></pre>

<p>But having a CSS class for these input fields, as suggested in ced's answer, is even better.</p>

<h2>Indentation</h2>

<p>You've gone with a structure like this:</p>

<pre><code>O RLY?
    YA RLY
        Froot R "Buzz"
OIC
</code></pre>

<p>I don't really like it. It has an extra indentation level. Instead, I'd opt to do this:</p>

<pre><code>O RLY?, YA RLY
    Froot R "Buzz"
OIC
</code></pre>

<p>You do get multiple statements on one line, but I'd see the <code>IZ WIN</code> (<code>== true</code> for those who are LOLCODE-inexperienced) as a part of the if statement.</p>

<h2>Indentation - Comments</h2>

<pre><code>  I HAS A Froot ITZ SUM OF Frootz AN 1
    BTW Froot will run 1 through 100
</code></pre>

<p>Why is this comment indented? I think it should be like so</p>

<pre><code>  I HAS A Froot ITZ SUM OF Frootz AN 1
  BTW Froot will run 1 through 100
</code></pre>

<p>Because there's no indentation level by variable assignment.</p>

<h2>Magic numbers</h2>

<p><code>100</code> should be a constant with a name that describes its meaning. Something like <code>FIZZBUZZLIMIT</code> or <code>MAXFIZZBUZZNUMBR</code>. Or even <code>STAHP</code>... but that might be less descriptive than the other names.</p>

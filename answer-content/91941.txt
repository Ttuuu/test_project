<p>Your code compiles, but your program is not exactly small. I like what you are trying to do. When I learn something new, I like to write a program to help showcase it. The problem is you need to bring the correct tools for the job. 
Analogously You probably could hammer a nail with a screwdriver, but I wouldn't recommend it.</p>

<p>There are multiple ways you could get this code under 10 lines.
use of "else" and "else if" may help. however you will make your life considerably easier using logical operators. For example</p>

<pre><code>#define max(x,y) ( x &gt; y ? x : y )
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>The above define is often used but can be dangerous as mentioned below. A better, significantly more safe way of doing this is like this:</p>

<pre><code>#define max(a,b) \
  ({ typeof (a) _a = (a); \
      typeof (b) _b = (b); \
    _a &gt; _b ? _a : _b; })
</code></pre>

<p>You could also use the c++ methods mentioned below.</p>

<p>you can make a simple preprocessor command that will give you the maximum value.</p>

<p>The logic for that command would read as if x is greater than y the answer is x, otherwise it's y.</p>

<p>The swap command mentioned above would work well to.
I <strong>highly</strong> recommend before limiting yourself to one statement you read a little about c++ operators. Try here.</p>

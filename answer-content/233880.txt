<p>I will give you some tips related to packet processing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have mutex/lock for every read packet is a bad idea in terms of performance</li>
<li>Copy packets form one place to another is also a bad idea, you should move packets or keep reference the same part, take into consideration that memory copy operations are expensive for a packet application like yours.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general your code is readable and is clear what you want to achieve, I will suggest you to use a profiler in order to find the bottlenecks.</p>

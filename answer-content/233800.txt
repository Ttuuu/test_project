<p>I like putting those moves into enums. This is quite common so I've found nice solution already. This will make your checking for who won a lot nicer and readable:

<p>Also I feel like there definitely should be some thread sleeps after drumroll to add some more tension! Ex:</p>

<pre><code>    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++) {
        System.out.println("------------------------------");
        Thread.sleep(500);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This will also require to add <code>throws Exception</code> (or <code>InterruptedException</code>) to main method signature.</p>

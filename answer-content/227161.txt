<p>There are many useless functions here, because individual time components aren't much use separately.  For example, <code>get_second()</code> is unlikely to be any use to anyone, as users generally want the minutes, too.  It won't work to separately call <code>get_minute()</code>, because that returns the "minute" component of a <em>different time-point</em> (that of the second call).  So the API presented is likely to encourage user errors.</p>

<p>I advise removing all the functions that return individual components.</p>

<p>There exist single formats for time and date - use <code>%T</code> instead of <code>%H:%M:%S</code>, and <code>%F</code> instead of <code>%Y-%m-%d</code>.  (Note that <code>%D</code> superficially appears like it might be the short date formate, but it's broken because it puts month first).</p>

<p>If we're to use this for logging, then <code>std::localtime</code> is a poor choice, as this has jumps and ambiguities around daylight savings changes.  <code>std::gmtime</code> is more suitable for this purpose, as it's monotonic on a well-administered system.</p>

<p>Oh, and you'll need your functions to have <em>static linkage</em>, so you don't get conflicts when two or more translation units both define the functions.</p>

<p>Having lots of conditionals makes code difficult to read, which is reflected in the fact that you've had to put comments throughout the code to remind yourself how it works!</p>

<p>How about this...</p>

<pre><code>public int maxBlock(String s) {
    if (s == null) {
        return 0;
    }
    char previousChar = 0;
    int longestRun = 0;
    int currentRun = 0;
    for (char currentChar : s.toCharArray()) {
        if (currentChar == previousChar) {
            currentRun++;
        } else {
            longestRun = Math.max(currentRun, longestRun);
            currentRun = 1;
            previousChar = currentChar;
        }
    }
    return Math.max(currentRun, longestRun);
}
</code></pre>

<p>To add one more thing to janos's review suggestions, one thing I noticed is that many of your comments are saying essentially the same thing as the code. I'd suggest leaving them out. Developers can read code and trust it more than comments, which often get out of sync with the code.</p>

<p>I understand semicolons in JavaScript are optional, however I believe you should always use them. It's easy to have something break later on because you neglected a semi-colon and it lost the whitespace which saved it before in a compression/generation/eval parse.</p>

<p>You could declare the <code>timePerShot</code> as a variable, to ensure the amount is not being calculated on every call (Although I'm pretty sure the parser or cache already solves this).</p>

<p>Use exceptions / errors in exceptional cases only. An example being making an HTTP call; The target could not exist, the internet could be down, or other cases that are out of your control. </p>

<p>Catching exceptions is also going to be very slow. You can return a value such as false instead. And/or you could do the check outside of the function.</p>

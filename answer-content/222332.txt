<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>        if (!isNaN(str1[i]) &amp;&amp; !isNaN(str2[i])) { // if both chars are numbers, return str with numerically smaller number
          return parseInt(str1.slice(i)) &lt; parseInt(str2.slice(i)) ? str1 : str2;
        }
</code></pre>

<p>seems like a bug. In case the numbers compare equal the code blindly returns the first string. Consider <code>(a10c, a10b)</code>.</p>

<hr>

<pre><code>return str1; // if we get here then both strings are equal and either can be returned
</code></pre>

<p>seems like another bug. At this point we only know that the strings are equal <em>up to the length of the shortest one</em>, and the shortest one should be returned. Which one is shortest is not tested here.</p>

<hr>

<p>The overall logic looks overcomplicated. Consider testing for numbers first; that would eliminate the need for a confusing <code>toUpper/toLower</code> mess, and the special case of special characters.</p>

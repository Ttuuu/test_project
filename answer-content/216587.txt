<p>In your class <code>Deck</code> the methods <code>add_normal_card</code> and <code>add_extra_cards</code> share a lot of duplicated code which only differs in the maximum number of allowed cards and the error message displayed if this number is exceeded.<br>
You could pull out the <code>else</code> path in an own method.</p>

<p>Also I was a bit confused about the attribute <code>main_deck</code> which is passed in <code>__init__</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>since the class itself is already named <code>Deck</code> one could assume that <code>main_deck</code> is also an instance of some kind of custom <code>Deck</code> class, while it is just a <code>list</code>. This could be clarified by picking another name (like <code>list_of_cards</code>), adding a docstring to <code>__init__</code> or using type hints.</li>
<li><code>add_extra_cards</code> checks the size of <code>main_deck</code> but returns the error message "You have to many cards in your extra deck (15)." I would assume that an extra deck and main deck are separate instances. Is this a bug?</li>
</ul>

<p>Last but not least the error handling of <code>add_normal_cards</code> and <code>add_extra_cards</code> can be improved. Right now they simply return <code>None</code> if all went well (which is OK), but if some of your conditions like maximum desk size are not met you simply return a <code>str</code>.<br>
Think about the caller of your methods and how he or she should handle those errors.
With your current implementation, they would need to check if the returned object is not <code>None</code> and then compare string values to determine what happened and react to it.
This is error prone because if you decide to change the phrasing of your return values the caller's code will break.<br>
Instead, you should raise a meaningful exception. Since you are dealing with three potential problems, you should define two custom exception classes, like <code>DeckSizeExceeded</code> and <code>CardCountExceeded</code>.<br>
The last possible error (<code>card_to_add not in all_cards</code>) could simply lead to an IndexError, so there is no need for a custom exception class here. </p>

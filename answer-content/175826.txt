<p>Your animation isn't smooth because the ball is jumping 9 pixels for every frame. If you want smooth animation, change your "speed" to a much smaller number.</p>

<p>Animation is a set of trade-offs. The speed is a simple multiplier of how many frames you display each second times how many pixels you move in each frame. As the number of pixels you move goes up, the more jerky the animation will be. Likewise, the more often you update, the faster your animation will go. You need to decide which is more important: smoothness or speed. </p>

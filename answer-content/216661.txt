<p>A nice trick you can use in python is to open two (or more) files at once in one line. This is done with something like:</p>

<pre><code>with open('file_one.txt', 'r') as file_one, open('file_two.txt', 'r') as file_two:
    for line in file_one:
        ...
    for line in file_two:
        ...
</code></pre>

<p>This is a very common way of reading from one file and writing to another without continually opening and closing one of them.</p>

<p>Currently, you're opening and closing the files with each iteration of the loop. Your program loops through the lines in <code>name.txt</code>, checks an <code>if</code> / <code>elif</code> condition, then if either are satisfied, a file is opened, written to, then closed again <em>with every iteration of the loop</em>.</p>

<p>Simply by opening both files at the same time you can stop opening and closing them repeatedly.</p>

<p>For more info on the <code>with</code> statement and other context managers, see <a href="https://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/context_managers.html" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Another small improvement can be made. At the moment, you check the first <code>if</code> condition every time, but you know it will only actually evaluate to <code>True</code> once. it would be better to remove that check and just always perform that block once. Assign counter <em>after</em> the first block (after where <code>if counter == 1</code> currently is) then replace the <code>elif</code> statement with a <code>while</code> loop.</p>

<hr>

<p>It would be worth getting familiar with <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="noreferrer">PEP8</a> if you're going to use Python a lot in the future. It's a standard style guide and will help with the readability of your code (for you and others). Just small stuff like new lines after colons or spaces either side of variable declarations / comparisons.</p>

<p>If you include an example file and desired output, there may be more I can help with.</p>

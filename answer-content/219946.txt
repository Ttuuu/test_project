<p>Overall a good job, and much better than the version you answered.</p>

<p><strong>Better Not to Ignore Warning Messages</strong><br>
Board.cpp generates 2 warning messages, the first is for a typo on the semicolon on this line:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;;
</code></pre>

<p>The second is for a type mismatch on this line</p>

<pre><code>    for (auto i = 0; i &lt; body.size(); ++i) {
</code></pre>

<p>Auto comes in very handy for some things, but it is best not to abuse it. C++ is not a scripting language and type checking in C++ is a good thing. Use auto to define iterators when looping through a container but use the proper type in other instances. It's generally a good idea for someone who has to maintain the code to know what type an objects is. Unlike C# and some other languages C++ does not have Reflection.</p>

<p><strong>Inlcude Header Files Within Headers</strong><br>
The code might be more maintainable if header files such as <code>Board.h</code> and <code>ConsoleOperations.h</code> included header files for objects they consume such as <code>SnakeDirection.h</code> and <code>Point.h</code>. As it is now someone using <code>Board.h</code> in a new file will run into compiler issues if they haven't already included the proper files. </p>

<p><strong>Check User Input</strong><br>
Neither the function <code>getKey()</code> nor <code>updateDirection(key, snakeDirection)</code> performs adequate error checking, if the user enters an illegal value, the behavior is unknown. It is always good to check user input.</p>

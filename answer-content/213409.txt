<p>I'd say one small optimization you could do is start <code>x</code> at 18, since none of the numbers below 19 would have digits that add up to 10. That way there would be quite a few less operations/function calls - this is important to be aware of with functional programming.</p>

<p>Also, if the function gets run multiple times, then it would be beneficial to memorize it- specifically, store results of calls to compute the digit sums for various values (of <code>x</code>) so they can be looked up quicker than re-computing them. </p>

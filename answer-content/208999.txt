<p><code>OutputThread.run</code> contains a <em>busy loop</em>: it is continuously checking for new input. That's a huge waste of CPU time. The least you could do to avoid that would be insert a <code>time.sleep(0.1)</code> inside the loop. A better approach would be to redirect <code>stdout</code> to a custom object that emits signals when written to. AFAIK it would suffice to implement <code>write</code> and <code>flush</code> methods in the custom object.</p>

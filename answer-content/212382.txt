<p>Not much to say about the extensions methods, as they are mostly wrappers.</p>

<p>However if you're looking for ways to make the algorithm more readable, LINQ is your friend. You can replace most of your logic with a one-liner:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>var hyphenCount = 0;

for (var i = 1; i &lt; str.Length - 1; i++)
{
    if (str[i].IsLetterOrDigit())
    {
        continue;
    }
    if (str[i].IsHyphen())
    {
        hyphenCount++;
        if (hyphenCount &gt; 1)
        {
            return false;
        }
    }
    else
    {
        return false;
    }
}

return true;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Like this:</p>

<pre><code>return str.All(c =&gt; c.IsHyphen() || c.IsLetterOrDigit()) &amp;&amp; str.Count(c =&gt; c.IsHyphen()) &lt;= 1;
</code></pre>

<p>Which more clearly explains your intent, you can also move those expression to their separate methods to make it as readable as possible, this way you can keep adding new conditions, without modifying the existing logic (unless they interfere with one another that is).</p>

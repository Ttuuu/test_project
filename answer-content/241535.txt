<p>A classic pattern is to set a ceiling for memory consumption and write a buffer function.  Once you hit the buffer limit, dump everything to a partial file ("file_part1.csv") and begin writing to the next partial file.  Once you're done writing everything, stitch the files together as a single csv.</p>

<p>Chapter 12 of the free Python reference "<a href="https://www.py4e.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python for Everybody</a>" demonstrates the pattern.  The chapter is written about networked programs, but the examples still apply.</p>

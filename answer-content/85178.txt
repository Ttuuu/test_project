<p>I really didn't like the way that @Edenia wrote the code; mine is like hers, only I think it is much cleaner and straightforward:</p>

<pre><code>    int isDivisibleBy(int number, int divisor)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i &lt;= number; i += divisor)
        {
            if (i == number)
            {
                return 1;
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>and this will work for any set of numbers and divisors.</p>

<hr>

<p>The reason I like my code better is because the <code>for</code> loop is complete in a single block; while this may be aesthetic, it still seems cleaner to me. 
And we add up to the Number so on the final run we see whether or not we land on the number by incrementing of the divisor until we reach the number.</p>

<p>Neither @Edenia's nor my answer will work for Negative numbers, so please be wary of plugging in a negative number in there.</p>

<hr>

<p>Because I was told this was not better than other code, I formulated a <code>while</code> loop version of this code as well; it is as follows and only checks the outcome once, and is still straight forward as to what it is doing.</p>

<pre><code>int isDivisibleBy(int number, int divisor)
{
    int i = 0;
    while (i &lt; number)
    {
        i += divisor;
    }
    return i == number;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Since everything in this code is defined statically rather than as a function input (and your comments indicate that there is no way to vary any part of how this code functions), there is no possibility allowed within the parameters of this question for the score to ever vary.  You can therefore make this code significantly more concise and efficient by simply computing the score statically:</p>

<pre><code>score = -15
</code></pre>

<p>This will produce the same score result as your original code with a significantly smaller footprint.</p>

<p>If this doesn't seem right, the question to ask yourself (and then answer for the benefit of your code reviewers) is: which constants in this code can vary, and what types/values are permissible for them?</p>

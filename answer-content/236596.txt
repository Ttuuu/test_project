<p>As in your previous question, your interface is still awkward. That is, if there's an <code>add</code> method, I fully expect that calling <code>a.add(b)</code> will mean that a results in a plus b. So in particular, the state of <code>a</code> will be changed.</p>

<p>A user of your class will also find <code>void printNumber(char mathOperator)</code> weird. Indeed, why as a user of the class do I need to worry about such details meaning the parameter? The user will just want to get his/her complex number printed and not be forced to worry about such details. So such a function might make sense as a private workhorse (but do make it <code>const</code> and read more about <code>const</code> - it's good for you) that <code>operator&lt;&lt;</code> can call, as explained in another answer.</p>

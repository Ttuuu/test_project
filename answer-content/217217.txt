<p>If it is PHP source code you want to highlight, why not use the tokenizer that's build into PHP itself? I use that and it seems to work fine:</p>

<pre><code>$tokens = token_get_all($sourceCode);
</code></pre>

<p>Then all you have to do is walk through all the tokens and give them a color.</p>

<p>See: <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.token-get-all.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.token-get-all.php</a></p>

<p>No extra library, no faffing around with endless regular expressions.</p>

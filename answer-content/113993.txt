<p>In addition to other answers here is a common way to avoid having too much code on top level:</p>

<pre><code>def main():
    fizz = int(input("Enter the number to Fizz: "))
    buzz = int(input("Enter the number to Buzz: "))
    maxNum = int(input("Enter the maximum number: "))
    fizzbuzz(maxNum, fizz, buzz)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</code></pre>

<p>This patterns allows for your script to be called from the command line, and it also allows for use as an module, so that you reuse your <code>fizzbuzz()</code> function.   </p>

<p>And whilst at it, even though this is a rather simple functions, please look into using docstrings to document your function and potentially your module.</p>

<p>The way to process recursively nested data is with recursively nested code.</p>

<p>I don't know Python, and I would do this in XQuery or XSLT by preference, but the pseudo-code is the same whatever the language:</p>

<pre><code>function deep_process (parent, table, level) {
   for child in parent.children() {
        shallow_process(child, table, level)
        deep_process(child, table, level+1);
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>where shallow_process() is whatever local processing you do at every level. </p>

<p>The key message to take away is that processing recursive data requires recursive code.</p>

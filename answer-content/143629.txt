<p>It's a shame python doesn't have a <code>do..while</code> loop, which would have been a better fit for the occasion.</p>

<p>You do plenty of branching. For every valid input, you check if the extreme values so far are still <code>None</code>. If you think about it, this will only be the case the first time a valid value is entered. It's not very plausible to keep on performing that check and it needlessly bloats the code.</p>

<p>To find maximum and minimum efficiently, <strong>use <code>max()</code> and <code>min()</code> and initialise your variables with appropriate values</strong>, that make the initial case blend in with the rest of the operation. +/-Infinity are good candidates for such values. <strong>Everything is bigger than -infinity, which makes it ideal as a starting value for the largest number.</strong> Here's what your code would look like with those changes applied:</p>

<pre><code>largest = -float('inf')
smallest = float('inf')

while True :
    num = raw_input("Enter a number: ")
    if num == "done" :
        break
    try :
        num = int(num)
    except :
        print "Invalid input"
        continue

    largest = max(num, largest)
    smallest = min(num, smallest)

print "Maximum is", largest
print "Minimum is", smallest
</code></pre>

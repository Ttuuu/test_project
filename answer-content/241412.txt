<p>It's not spaghetti code. Although it is a bit strange that main just calls mainMenu. It could contain a loop that would end when mainMenu returns false and mainMenu would return false if user wants to quit. </p>

<p>There are a few minor gotchas, im sure someone else will point out... </p>

<p>I just wanna say this Is a good candidate for OOP, especialy for Its polymorphism feature. But I suppose you're not that far yet, so I won't show you any code, unless you're really interested. </p>

<p>It's quite a good code for the level I suppose you are on :) </p>

<p>One note, there is hardly any value in those comments, use comments to clarify things that may not be obvious. Commenting on block ends and repeating what is clear from code itself just does not help, if not worse. And honestly i dont see a single useful comment in your code. It is just too simple to need any.</p>

<p>Maybe one more, dont abbreviate names like <code>trInput</code>, it then starts to need comments... Code that is self documented is always better (in terms of readability) then having to explain everything in comments.</p>

<p>It may be good to comment on complex formulae as to why they solve given problem as those things are often not clear at first glance, you may put a reference to mathematical proof in comment for example. Or if a function accepts integer, but it wont work if it is larger than 100, then put it in comment with explanation why it cannot work. And things like that...</p>

<p>I understand what you're doing with <code>float('inf')</code>. Here is a possible way to make it a bit cleaner and more straightforward. Consider the following function:</p>
<pre><code>def combine(left: list, right: list) -&gt; list: 
    combined_list = []
    
    # non-empty/non-empty case
    # - results in empty/non-empty OR non-empty/empty case
    while len(left) &gt; 0 and len(right) &gt; 0: 
        if left[0] &lt; right[0]:
            combined_list.append(left.pop(0))
        else:
            combined_list.append(right.pop(0))
      
    # empty/non-empty case OR empty/empty case
    # - One of these will be empty so extending by it will do nothing
    # - The other will have sorted items remaining that belong at the end of 
    #   the combined list anyway.
    # - If they are both empty this will simply do nothing.

    combined_list.extend(left)
    combined_list.extend(right)
    
    return combined_list
</code></pre>
<p>The resulting function is bit more straightforward in my opinion. Perhaps you'll agree.</p>

<h2>A couple remarks</h2>

<ul>
<li>You don't need a dataset here, just a datatable. Datasets come into play when you have multiple tables with relationships. </li>
<li>I would rather set the headers and the overall layout for the <code>datagridview</code> <strong>early</strong>, for example right after <code>InitializeComponent()</code> </li>
<li>But in fact I would not even do this in code. I would simply customize the control in the form layout window, and set all properties that can defined before runtime.</li>
<li>Good <strong>naming conventions</strong> are important - <code>Form19</code> is not a good, descriptive name. Nor is <code>dataGridView1</code> or <code>button1</code>. These are default names.</li>
<li>This code may not be complete, but this form has several imports that are unneeded: Drawing, Threading,... don't add more than what is strictly needed, that only clutters the code for nothing. Yes, using LINQ would be a good idea, if not here it will be useful at other places.</li>
<li>The <strong>scope</strong> of some variables can be moved up to form level, for example <code>DS</code>, because in another procedure you might want to check the number of rows retrieved</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>I don't understand why you have:</p>

<pre><code>using (var dataSet = new DataSet())
{
    DataSet DS = new DataSet();
    mySqlDataAdapter.Fill(DS);

    //Assign headers to Data Grid View
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>What you effectively use is variable <code>DS</code>, not <code>dataSet</code> (by the way <code>dataSet</code> is a terrible name for a dataset...be careful with <strong>reserved keywords</strong>)</p>

<hr>

<p>The string concatenation for the SQL is ugly. LINQ is an option. Another option for multi-line string literals is a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/tokens/verbatim" rel="nofollow noreferrer">verbatim string</a> using the <code>@</code> symbol so you can define a variable for your SQL like this:</p>

<pre><code>string sql = @"SELECT r.date_requested, u.username, r.product_code, r.customer_code 
FROM verify v JOIN request r ON v.request_id = r.id JOIN users u ON r.user_id = u.id JOIN 
users u2 on v.user_id = u2.id
WHERE v.status = 'Verified' OR v.status = 'Rejected';";
</code></pre>

<p>Even in this day and age of large monitors, I think it is reasonable to limit column width to around 80 - your code extends to column 163. It is not convenient for the human eye to scan/scroll long lines of text.</p>

<hr>

<p>Final point: comments. You have some comments in your code but they are not helpful:</p>

<pre><code>// MySQL connection string
using (var conn = new MySqlConnection(connString))

//Seelct query
using (var mySqlDataAdapter...
</code></pre>

<p>It is quite obvious what these lines do, I have not learned or remembered anything noteworthy from your comments.</p>

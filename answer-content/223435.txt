<p>As @Hesclacher has given a fantastic answer, which is not only one that I have upvoted but I would personally mark it as the correct answer if I had the power, I am hesitant to improve upon it.  But I would like to offer constructive feedback on your original code.</p>

<p>I have a personal distinction between being a VB Coder and a .NET Developer.  I think you can use VB.NET and be what I define to be a .NET Developer - that is you are making traditional .NET calls like any C# dev would use.  I define a VB Coder has someone who still thinks and codes with VBA in mind, and such a person relies upon some of the compatibility calls, such as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/language-reference/functions/return-values-for-the-cstr-function" rel="nofollow noreferrer">CStr</a>.</p>

<p>According to my own such definitions, a VB Coder would use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/language-reference/functions/return-values-for-the-cstr-function" rel="nofollow noreferrer">CStr</a> whereas a .NET Developer would use String.Format (as did Heschalcher) or better yet, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/strings/interpolated-strings" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Interpolated Strings</a>.</p>

<p><strong>VB Coder</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>hourString = Cstr(hours) &amp; " hours"
</code></pre>

<p><strong>.NET Developer</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>hourString = String.Format("{0} hours", hours)
</code></pre>

<p>Or</p>

<pre><code>hourString = $"{hours} hours"
</code></pre>

<p>To calculate the number of hours, if you aren't going to use something nice like TimeSpan, I would change this line of code:</p>

<pre><code>hours = floor(TotalSeconds / 3600)
</code></pre>

<p>To simply use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/language-reference/operators/integer-division-operator" rel="nofollow noreferrer">integer division</a>:</p>

<pre><code>hours = TotalSeconds \ 3600
</code></pre>

<p>Also, VB.NET does support short-circuited conditionals (unlike VBA), so this line of code:</p>

<pre><code>If hours &gt; 0 and (minutes &gt; 0 or seconds &gt; 0) Then
</code></pre>

<p>could be changed to:</p>

<pre><code>If hours &gt; 0 AndAlso (minutes &gt; 0 OrElse seconds &gt; 0) Then
</code></pre>

<p>This example employs short-circuiting with the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/language-reference/operators/andalso-operator" rel="nofollow noreferrer">AndAlso</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/language-reference/operators/orelse-operator" rel="nofollow noreferrer">OrElse</a> operators.</p>

<p>Again, Heschachler's answer with <code>TimeSpan</code> and <code>StringBuilder</code> is spot-on.</p>

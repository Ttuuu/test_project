<p>It decreases the size of image, turns it B&amp;W, and then uses GetPixel() to generate hash.</p>

<p>It is much faster, efficient, and works! It is able to find equal images with:</p>

<ul>
<li>different file formats (e.g. jpg, png, bmp)</li>
<li>rotation (90, 180, 270) - by changing the iteration order of i and j</li>
<li>different dimensions (same aspect is required)</li>
<li>different compression (tolerance is required in case of quality loss like jpeg artifacts) - you can accept a 99% equality to be the same image and 50% to be a different one.</li>
</ul>

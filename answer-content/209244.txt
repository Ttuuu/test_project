<p><code>IsIPv4Address</code> should pass a value of 3 for <code>maxsplit</code> on your <code>split</code> call.</p>

<p>Most of that function (after the len check) can be condensed to:</p>

<pre><code>return all(IsInteger(o) and 0 &lt;= o &lt; 256 for o in octets)
</code></pre>

<p>Your <code>IsIPv4Mask</code> should probably be done in a very different manner - rather than string-ifying the octets to binary text, it should convert the words to a single 32-bit integer (as is done everywhere else), for efficiency. At that point, write a loop that</p>

<ul>
<li>checks the current LSB </li>
<li>shifts the integer by 1</li>
<li>loops until the integer is equal to 0</li>
</ul>

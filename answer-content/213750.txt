<p>Some suggestions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When I copy/paste the code into a file locally, I have problems with Python reading the source encoding. You didn't specify an encoding, and your joke text is full of non-ascii characters.</p>

<p>I'd suggest that you store your jokes in a separate file, and read in that file either at startup or each time the joke function is called.</p></li>
<li><p>You have to ask the user's name in two places: during startup, and when changing the name in the settings. Therefore, you need a <code>get_name()</code> function to be called both places.</p></li>
<li><p>I'm not sure what the restart operation is about. But Python uses <code>None</code> to indicate no value, so that might be better than settings things to <code>"Null"</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Your math function is bad. Write an expression parser instead. ;-)</p></li>
<li><p>Don't catch <code>Exception</code>. It's a bad practice. Catch the specific error you intend to handle.</p></li>
<li><p>You have a bunch of bare code at the bottom of the file. Organize that into a <code>main</code> routine, and then do:</p>

<pre><code>if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</code></pre>

<p>Doing this will allow you to import the module without going into the chatterbot directly, which means you can write unit tests for the various parts of the system.</p></li>
</ol>

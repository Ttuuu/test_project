<p>The correct way of solving this is with a sparse bit set. Sadly there is none in the standard jdk that I know of. So for simplicity HashSet is the closest we get. See the answer from Vogel612 for how to use it.</p>

<p>The lines of numbers could be LONG.
If the input is</p>

<pre><code>   112233445566...N
</code></pre>

<p>your program start by allocating a array of size 2*n+1.
A better approach is to read the file and add and remove them as you go. In this case you would only ever have 2 elements in your hash set at the most.</p>

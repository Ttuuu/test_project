<p>The solution that @Tunaki suggested works, but doesn't count duplicates. For example, in the input array:
<code>[1, 8, -3, 0, 1, 3, -2, 4, 5]</code> and <code>k=6</code>, @Tunaki's answer will output 6 (instead of 7), because the number 3 is twice in the array. </p>

<p>Consider this implementation which handles duplicates correctly, using python:</p>

<pre><code>from collections import Counter

def solution(k, nums):
    # a list of opposite to the numbers in the input list.
    # for example, if 4 is in the input list and 6 is k,
    # then 6-4=2 will be added to the diffs list
    diffs = []
    for num in nums:
        diffs.append(k-num)

    k_complementary_sum = 0

    nums_counter = Counter(nums)  # counting how many times a number appears in the input list
    for num in diffs:
        k_complementary_sum += nums_counter[num]  # if the diff is not in the original input, the Counter will give 0
    return k_complementary_sum

</code></pre>

<p>I'm using Counter to sum up the number that element is in the input list. </p>

I'm not sure about the complexity of this answer, but is a two liner and it does the job :) </p>

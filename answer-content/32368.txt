<p>Not sure if still relevant, but here you go:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Consider refactoring <code>if (this.disposed) { }</code> into a method like <code>ThrowIfDisposed()</code>. If you ever want to change the dispose method or add logging or whatnot then you have to change only one place. Code duplication should be avoided even for trivial things like that.</p></li>
<li><p>You swallow exceptions in <code>Hook</code> and <code>Unhook</code> and return a <code>bool</code> which tells you nothing except that it went wrong. Same in <code>OpenConnection</code> and <code>CloseConnetion</code>. A lot of information is thrown away which will be useful for troubleshooting should the need arise. In general I would consider that a bad idea.</p></li>
<li><p>Replace the magic constant <code>Thread.Sleep(100);</code> either with a <code>const</code> definition or even a setting you can tweak. If you make it a setting please make it a <code>TimeStamp</code> - I personally find all that code which scatters around <code>int</code>s with implicit units very annoying. I often have to look up what it means because it's not always that obvious - seconds, milliseconds, ..?</p></li>

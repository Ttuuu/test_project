<p>I don't know Lua, but one thing that stands out is your use of <code>== true</code>/<code>== false</code> in <code>if</code> statements. </p>

<p>Code in any language gets more readable by omitting <code>== true</code> and substituting <code>not x</code> for <code>x == false</code>. The expressions are already usable as booleans, you don't have to explicitly compare them to a constant.</p>

<h3>How do I use this?</h3>

<p>I don't understand how to use this.  It took me some time to understand the reason for the getter, and I can't see how to retrieve anything from this cache.</p>

<h3>Why do I need to <code>Add</code> the value when I have the delegate?</h3>

<p>In the <code>Add</code> method, it doesn't make sense to add provide both a value and a method that calculates the value; it is very likely that someone will pass in inconsistent arguments and get unexpected results.  It should suffice to simply pass in the delegate, and let the value calculate itself.</p>

<h3>Why is this static?</h3>

<p>It is very dangerous to have one global cache holding every different type.  You should allow for multiple caches for different purposes, and then you can...</p>

<h3>Make this cache generic</h3>

<p>Nobody likes to cast from <code>Object</code>.  Your interface should be <code>Cacheable&lt;T&gt;</code>, so that we can check at compile time that the type to be returned is what we expect.</p>

<h3>Your response is not guaranteed</h3>

<p>Your callback is only called after the item has been removed from the cache.  Even if you add the previous value back straight away, a poorly-timed interrupt could have another thread searching for a key in that split-millisecond it's not there.</p>

<p>The adviced way to call a service endpoint when the connection is not an open stream, is to have the lifecycle of you client in line with the operation you are calling.</p>

<p>So rather than storing an instance of the client..</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>private WebService()
    {
        client = new MyWebServiceContractClient();
    }
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>You should create a client on demand. To work around the known issue on <code>Dispose</code>, a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100703123454/http://old.iserviceoriented.com/blog/post/Indisposable+-+WCF+Gotcha+1.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">solid solution</a> is available.</p>

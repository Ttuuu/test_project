<p>You clone an array 3 times by using:</p>

<pre><code>currentSequence = Array.prototype.slice.call(konamiSequence);
</code></pre>

<p>but with ES6, you can also use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the spread operator</a> to clone an array:</p>

<pre><code>currentSequence = [... konamiSequence];
</code></pre>

<p>It took me a while to figure out the complex outer construction in your code:</p>

<pre><code>const {onKonamiSequenceTriggered, clearKonamiSequanceTriggered} = (() =&gt; {

    .... actual code ...

    return {
        onKonamiSequenceTriggered,
        clearKonamiSequanceTriggered
    };
})();
</code></pre>

<p>It is an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#Object_destructuring" rel="nofollow noreferrer">object destructuring assignment</a> which is assigned two methods by using a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE" rel="nofollow noreferrer">self-executing anonymous function</a>. I guess the advantage is that you can use local scope within the anonymous function. Note that you could leave out all of the code, in the excerpt above, and your code would still work, albeit completely in global scope.</p>

<p>I did find <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31626852/how-to-add-konami-code-in-a-website-based-on-html/51048424#51048424">code on Stack Overflow which looks similar</a>, but it is obviously not the same.</p>

<p>I'm not an Javascript expert, so that's all I have. I learned something from this, but I still think that Javascript has some awful language constructs (in other words: I'm not used to it).</p>

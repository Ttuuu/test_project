<p>There are several advantages to writing proper HTML and using semantic tags. Instead of asking yourself "How should this look?" Ask yourself "What does this mean?".</p>

<p>What does it mean for a text to be red? Does it mean <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>phasized text? Maybe <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> text? You can always apply the <code>style="color: red;"</code> on top of that (or even better, with a classname).</p>

<p>What are the advantages?</p>

<ul>
<li><s><code>&lt;font&gt;</code></s> is deprecated. Today it's still supported, mainly due to idiots who want their sites to run with IE5.5, but that may not be the case in the future. One day, <s><code>&lt;font&gt;</code></s> might just stop working altogether. Its behavior is currently undefined in latest versions of HTML, and will lead to unpredictable variations between browser implementations, and between browser versions.</li>
<li>Using proper elements (<code>&lt;em&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> as opposed to <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> or <s><code>&lt;font&gt;</code></s>) makes <strong>machines</strong> understand your text better. That's good for accessibility, SEO, and a bunch of other things that entities which are not actual human readers do.</li>
<li>Using proper elements makes your site look better by default. Say a client does not use CSS, he's on a very old phone, or just uses some obscure browser. <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> shows up as <em>italicized</em>, <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> shows up as <strong>bold</strong>. <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> shows up completely normally.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Other than that, if you're already defining all of the CSS rules in your template engine, why not use HTML to begin with? There's no point in complicating things with <em>yet another</em> syntax. Write valid, proper HTML from start to end, and be done with it.</p>

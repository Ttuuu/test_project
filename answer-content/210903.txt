<h2>Do one thing at a time</h2>

<p>Don't put multiple statements on one line, i.e.</p>

<pre><code>if obj[j] in set(data[i, :]): globals()['data_row' + str(i).zfill(3)] += [j]
</code></pre>

<h2>Global population?</h2>

<p>You're doing a curious thing. You're populating the global namespace with some variable names that have integral indices baked into them. Since I can't find a reason for this anywhere in your description (and even if you did have a reason, it probably wouldn't be a good one), really try to avoid doing this. In other words, rather than writing to</p>

<pre><code>globals['data_row001']
</code></pre>

<p>just write to a list called <code>data_row</code> (and <code>obj_lst</code>, etc.). You can still print it in whatever format you want later.</p>

<h2>Use fluent syntax</h2>

<p>For long statements with several <code>.</code> calls, such as this:</p>

<pre><code>data = pd.read_csv('file.txt', sep=r'\t+', header=None, engine='python').values[:,:].astype('&lt;U1000')
</code></pre>

<p>try rewriting it on multiple lines for legibility:</p>

<pre><code>data = (pd
   .read_csv('file.txt', sep=r'\t+', header=None, engine='python')
   .values[:,:]
   .astype('&lt;U1000')
)
</code></pre>

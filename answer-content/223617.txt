<p>Just a few things not already mentioned by other answers:</p>

<p>Are you sure that you will need <code>DrawRandomCard()</code> ? How many card games have you played where you just draw from a random position in the deck? The only times I can think of this is useful is when you do a magic trick, which doesn't really work the same in code as in real life :) Normally in card games, you shuffle the deck and then draw from top or bottom.</p>

<p>Different card games might want to sort the deck in different ways, as others have mentioned already, but there's more options as well. Does Aces count as high or low? (Or both?) Should the sort order of the suits be [Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades], or [Clubs, Diamonds, Spades, Hearts], or [Diamonds, Hearts, Spades, Clubs] ? This can be dependent on the type of game, and maybe also a player's preferences. Adding more flexible options for Ace low/high and Suit order to your comparer would be good.</p>

<h1>Your deck isn't fair</h1>

<p>This code will happily deal a card that's already been dealt:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>int getCard() {

    return std::rand() % 11 + 2;

}
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Real Blackjack uses a <em>finite</em> set of cards, usually a fixed number of standard decks shuffled together.  The code here is equivalent to dealing from an <em>infinite</em> deck (or to replacing cards to be drawn again).</p>

<p>The difference may well be important to anyone using this program to practice their card-counting technique.</p>

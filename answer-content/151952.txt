<p>Whenever you are doing string addition in Python, you are probably doing it wrong. It is very slow, due to strings being immutable. Because of this Python will have to create a new string <em>everytime</em> you do string addition and copy over the content of the two strings you are adding.</p>

<p>As a fix, just use <code>list</code> and <code>str.join</code>. Also, creating a password from a possible list of characters is something you might want to do again, so I would put it into a function.</p>

<pre><code>import string
chars = string.digits + string.ascii_letters

def create_password(chars):
    password = []
    for _ in range(random.randint(100000, 250000)):
        password.append(random.choice(chars))
    return "".join(password)
</code></pre>

<p>This can be even further simplified using <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/random.html#random.sample" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>random.sample</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>def create_password(chars):
    length = random.randint(100000, 250000)
    return "".join(random.sample(chars, length))
</code></pre>

<p>I noticed that you are updating <code>extraspeed</code> every frame.</p>

<p>An alternative to this could be:</p>

<pre><code>if extraspeed &lt; 10:
    desired_boost = floor(score / 100)
    if desired_boost &lt;= 10:
        extraspeed = desired_boost
    else:
        extraspeed = 10
</code></pre>

<p>This way, you aren't updating <code>extraspeed</code> every frame, only when it is less than <code>10</code>.</p>

<p>Also, you should remove the semicolons on the following lines:</p>

<pre><code>score = 0;
ind = 0; #current frame of player, there is 3
extraspeed = 0;
</code></pre>

<p>I'll look further into this for you, but I've never personally drawn to a screen other than my computer screen so I may be unable to assist you further.</p>

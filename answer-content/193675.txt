<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>A table has no order.  The sort will be non-deterministic.  </p>

<p>Three things must line up:</p>

<ol>
<li>Same number of columns</li>
<li>Same (or compatible) type for the column to column </li>
<li>Proper order of the columns </li>
</ol>

<p>Seems like a lot could go wrong. Even if one table is a clone of the other you still need a sort. </p>

<p>Not getting the <code>' WHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE THEN DELETE;';</code></p>

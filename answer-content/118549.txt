<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<blockquote>
  <p>My biggest concern is this: navigationService.Navigate("FirstPage"));
  I pass view name as a string. That's because I don't want my ViewModel
  knows anything about View. But my navigation service HAS TO KNOW about
  View. That's why I did that interface with string parameter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a given design, independently from any implementation, a dependency either exist or not. Trying to solve this "problem" in the implementation is impossible.</p>

<p>You have to choose if your navigation service helps navigating through xaml views, or through some higher level, more abstract "navigation items".</p>

<p>First thing I think of is that you have a pretty long <code>main</code>. You should split the code in more functions. Your code could look like this:</p>

<pre><code>long long readCardnumber();
bool validateChecksum(long long cardnumber);
typedef enum { invalid, amex, mastercard, visa } company;
company getCompany(long long cardnumber);


int main() 
{
    long long cardnumber = readCardnumber();
    bool valid = validateCardnumber(cardnumber);
    if(!valid) {
        printf("INVALID\n");
        exit(0);
    }
    company comp = getCompany(long long cardnumber);
    switch(comp) {
        case visa: printf("VISA\n"); break;
        case mastercard: printf("MASTERCARD\n"); break;
        case amex: printf("AMEX\n"); break;
        default: printf("INVALID\n");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Another thing is that you are writing <code>if (valid == false)</code>. Just write <code>if (!valid)</code> instead. At least I think it looks way better, since it feels natural to read it as <em>"if not valid"</em>. Also, write <code>if (valid)</code> instead of <code>if (valid == true)</code>.</p>

<p>One general advice on boolean expressions. Consider writing <code>if(3 == var)</code> instead of <code>if(var == 3)</code>. The reason is if you accidentally write <code>=</code> instead of <code>==</code> you will get compiling code with an annoying bug if you write the constant on the right. If you have it on the left, you will instead get a compilation error, which is much nicer to handle. (I don't do this myself though, and the only reason is that I don't like how it looks.) </p>

<p>There are some other stuff that I would consider bad design, like when you are resetting the value of <code>cardNumber</code> several times. However, this is a direct consequence of not having separate functions.</p>

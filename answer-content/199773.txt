<p>Singletons are generally a bad idea unless you have a specific reason for them. (They are almost like global variables.) In this case, I see no reason why <code>TetrisGame</code> should be a singleton. In fact, it seems quite plausible that you might want to instantiate two of them, if you wanted to allow two players to play their games simultaneously.</p>

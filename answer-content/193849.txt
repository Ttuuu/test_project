<p>When I finish writing code, I usually ask myself : <em>"Okay, do I think I'd be able to understand my code in six months?"</em></p>
<p>If the answer is no, it means I'm not done. My code needs to be clearer.</p>
<p>I 100% think I wouldn't understand your code in six months as I don't get it now.</p>
<h2>Naming</h2>
<p>Crudely put, the variable names are terrible. What does <code>a,b,c,d,e</code> mean? Why is 19, 11, 21, etc there?</p>
<p>As I said above, I don't understand your code so I can't propose better names, but you should name your variables accordingly to what they do <strong>and</strong> use variables for all those "magic numbers". "Six months in the future" yourself might thank you if there's a bug in the code.</p>
<p>I'd also rename the method to <code>GetEasterDate</code>.</p>

<p>You've misspelt <code>std::size_t</code>.</p>

<p>Apart from that, the code seems reasonably straightforward if you always need to return a copy.</p>

<p>A two-pass algorithm (reverse the whole string, then reverse each of the individual components) might be faster, because you can operate in-place, without having to create a new string.  Of course, you'll only get the speed benefit if the caller doesn't need to retain the original (pass by value, and use <code>std::move</code> to control copying).</p>

<p>I can't make comment on the java, but I do have a couple of comments on the algorithm.</p>

<p>You pose the problem as <code>a+k=b</code>, but you use <code>i</code>, <code>j</code> in your code. The logical naming paradigm would be to stick with <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>. You also don't use <code>k</code>, where is it?</p>

<p>To me, it looks like you have tried to overcomplicate things because you wanted to use the cool java functions. You start with an array, but you then turn it into an IntStream. You then loop through the IntStream. Why not just loop through the array?</p>

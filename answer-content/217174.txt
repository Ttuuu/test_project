<p>Regarding: </p>

<pre><code>char* buffer = malloc(sizeof(char) * bufferSize);
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li><p>Always check (!=NULL) the returned value to assure the operation was successful.  If not successful, then call <code>perror( "my error message" );</code> to notify the user that a problem occurred and what the system thinks is the cause of the problem.  Then, most likely, clean up (close files, etc) then call: <code>exit( EXIT_FAILURE );</code>  </p></li>
<li><p>The expression: <code>sizeof( char )</code> is defined in the C standard as 1.  Multiplying anything by 1 has no effect.  I suggest removing that expression.</p></li>

<p>If you are learning C++, then you should start using qualifiers immediately, so that it becomes second nature. There are 3 notable ones in your case:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><code>const</code>
You are already using it great</p></li>
<li><p><code>noexcept</code>
This tells the compiler that this function cannot throw. Consequently the compiler can simplify exception handling around this function. There are 6 functions for your cycle, of which only 2 are guaranteed to be <code>noexept</code>. Can you tell which and why?</p></li>
<li><p><code>constexpr</code> 
This applies to compile time evaluation. This is a rather complex topic, but you should definitely read up on it as soon as possible, as thedirection in C++ is to go as much as possible towards constexpr.</p>

<p>Your constructor can be constexpr. This turns your Circle class into a <code>literal</code>.
You can also apply constexpr to all the other functions except for the ostream operator. Please inform yourself about the relation between <code>noexcept</code> and <code>constexpr</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>For completeness sake there are also the following additional qualifiers that should always be used when applicable: <code>final</code> and <code>overload</code>. However they are only relevant with respect to virtual functions.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The problem in this code is the <code>lists:seq/2</code> calls which generates lists in memory which you then traverse. Since you have 3 such generations, you end up with a cartesian product of generating lists. In effect, the Garbage collector has a lot of work to do then.</p>

<p>A much faster approach is to write functions which does the traversal by tail-calling each other. This way, you should be able to run in no time. It won't be Pascal-fast, but it will answer in a couple of milliseconds.</p>

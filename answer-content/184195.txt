<p>As you go through the array just record the letters you have seen. So if you have seen them before you can remove them. There are only 26 letters so an array of 26 characters should work. If you want to catch all variations than an array of UCHAR_MAX (all valid characters) can be used (usually around 256 on some rare systems 512 but is directly related to CHAR_BIT).</p>

<pre><code>bool   seen[26] = {0};
std::erase(std::remove_if(std::begin(str), std::end(str), [&amp;seen](unsigned x)
{
    unsigned char lower  = std::to_lower(x);
    bool          result = seen[lower - 'a'];
    seen[lower - 'a']    = true;
    return result;
}));

<p>For the most part I agree with your code.  However there are a couple of things:</p>

<p><code>IsValidBST</code> I think is redundant.  Anyone running this method already knows it applies to a BST.  I think just <code>IsValid</code> would be better.</p>

<p><code>Helper</code> should have a better name, I think an <code>IsValid</code> overload would work and it should be private.</p>

<p>It doesn't make much sense to me to make an instance of this class.  The methods don't rely on anything internal to the class.  I would suggest making the methods <code>static</code>.</p>

<p>It could look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class IsValidBSTclass
{
    public static bool IsValid(TreeNode root)
    {
        return IsValid(root, null, null);
    }
    private static bool IsValid(TreeNode root, TreeNode minNode, TreeNode maxNode)
    {
        if (root == null)
        {
            return true;
        }
        if (minNode != null &amp;&amp; root.val &lt;= minNode.val || maxNode != null &amp;&amp; root.val &gt;= maxNode.val)
        {
            return false;
        }

        return IsValid(root.left, minNode, root) &amp;&amp; IsValid(root.right, root, maxNode);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I was planning to suggest filtering the users in the query, as Bohdan suggested.</p>

<p>Another suggestion is to default to using <code>const</code> for all variables including arrays. This will help avoid accidental re-assignment. If you determine that you need to re-assign a variable then switch it to <code>let</code>.</p>

<p>The variable <code>getTEvent</code> can be declared with <code>const</code> since it is never re-assigned. If you had to remove all elements the <code>length</code> property could be set to <code>0</code>.</p>

<p>Also you can use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>for...of</code></a> loops instead of <code>for</code> loops when the index is not used for anything other than selecting a current index. You could also consider a functional approach with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>array.filter()</code></a> - this would avoid the need to push filtered items manually.</p>

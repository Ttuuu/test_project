<p>The usual advice is "make meaningful variables". However, we know this algorithm (essentially a modification of that published by a young Gau√ü) and those variables don't have a simple meaning. (See <a href="//math.stackexchange.com/q/896954">Decoding Gauss Easter algorithm</a>). We know <code>b</code> represents centuries, but even if you did find a word to describe what the variables represent, would using <code>epact</code> or even <code>ageOfMoonOnJanFirst</code> help to understand the algorithm? The variable represent stages of the algorithm. As Gauss wrote "It is not possible to present the full analysis that led to the algorithm".</p>

<p>So the usual cure of incomprehensible code - clear variables names - won't help much here.  What can we do for the poor person who has to maintain this code 6 months, or 6 years, later?  We can let them know where this algorithm comes from. This is easy enough. A comment referencing the source would allow someone seeing this to check that it is still doing what it is supposed to do.</p>

<p>Beyond adding this comment, the algorithm for calculating Easter is unlikely to be a bottleneck in any piece of software, so assuming that this algorithm is correct (proven and tested) I would leave it as is. </p>

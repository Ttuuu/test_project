<p>Other answers got most things, I am just adding what they missed.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>1) Avoid having same names of member variables and method arguments</strong></p>

<p><code>LinkedListIterator(TNode* p) : p(p) {}</code> --- Avoid having same names of member variables and method arguments, since if you need to use it in the constructor, you may be surprised of what gets used.</p>

<p>For example :</p>

<pre><code>LinkedListIterator(TNode* p) : p(p) {
  ++ p; // ops method argument modified
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>2) Avoid having init functions</strong></p>

<p>The constructors are for the class initialization, therefore try to avoid having such functions. As other answers showed, you even made it wrong.</p>

<p>If you need to initialize common things in several constructors, you can use <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13662441/c11-allows-in-class-initialization-of-non-static-and-non-const-members-what-c">this way of initializing common member variables</a>.</p>

<p><strong>3) Try to avoid using the <code>friend</code> keyword</strong></p>

<p>The fact that you used the <code>friend</code> keyword in so many places, indicates that the coupling of your classes is high, meaning you didn't do your design properly.</p>

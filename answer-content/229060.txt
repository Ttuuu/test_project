<p><strong>Algorithm</strong><br>
As @MinMax pointed out there are limitations to Queue implementations using arrays.</p>

<p>I would personally use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list" rel="noreferrer">linked list</a> to implement a queue rather than an array. The only size limit on the queue implemented with a linked list is how much memory can be allocated. The front of a queue implemented using a linked list can be deleted. There doesn't have to be a rear variable for a linked list, although it does speed up adding items to the queue.</p>

<p>Rather than using the terms <code>insert</code> and <code>delete</code> you might want to use <code>enqueue</code> and <code>dequeue</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Global Variables</strong><br>
This implementation of a queue uses global variables for everything. As programs get larger and more complex global variables make writing and modifying the code more error prone and they are harder to debug because one has to find every instance of the use of the global variable. Global variables can also cause linking problems when the variables are declared in multiple files and used differently in those files.</p>

<p>A better practice would be to declare the variable in a function and then pass the variable by reference to any other functions that need to modify it. </p>

<p>It is possible to join the queries into one query by having two separate queries on <code>table1</code> that join on the primary key:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT orig_setting_tbl.PARAM_ID, PARAM_1, PARAM_2, PARAM_3, PARAM_4, PARAM_5, PARAM_6, PARAM_7, PARAM_8
FROM
(SELECT PARAM_ID, PARAM_1, PARAM_2, PARAM_3, PARAM_4, PARAM_5, PARAM_6, PARAM_7
FROM table1 WHERE orig_setting = 1) AS orig_setting_tbl
LEFT OUTER JOIN
(SELECT PARAM_ID, PARAM_8
FROM table1 WHERE curr_setting = 1) AS curr_setting_tbl
ON orig_setting_tbl.PARAM_ID = curr_setting_tbl.PARAM_ID 
</code></pre>

<p>this gives you the correct complete set of params for the same PARAM_ID. all rows where orig_setting = 1 are fetched. rows that do not have matching curr_setting = 1, will have null value in PARAM_8.<br>
I believe this will perform better than iterating over two queries.</p>

<p><em>Is somthing wrong or unnecessarily complicated with my approach?</em></p>

<p>Requiring a dedicated class for each property is unnecessarily complicated.</p>

<p><em>Is a similar system used in some standard libraries?</em></p>

<p>No (standard library is a questionable term, the JRE doesn't come with such a featrue).</p>

<p><em>Am I missing some important functionality that a property-system should have?</em></p>

<p>Serialization.</p>

<p>Since your properties require dedicated code for each property, what benefits does it offer over simply serializing a dedicated property-object into a DataOutputStream? The code requires a lot of JavaDoccing and is a lot more complicated than, for example, Commons Configuration.</p>

<p>First, you need to consider that adding 271 million records is going to be long, there's no changing that. You should also consider your processing power. You could have the best code in the world, if it runs on an average computer it's going to be average.</p>

<p>Now, what can be done better?</p>

<p>What you're doing is called bulk insertion. There are mechanisms with every database engine that enable doing this faster than one insert at a time. For example, you should consider using the <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/Bulk.insert/" rel="noreferrer">Bulk</a> object to insert many lines at the same time. Basically, you want most of your processing to be done by the database engine, simply because it was written by experts on how to do things fast and without problems. Looking at the <code>Bulk</code> object maximum size, your bulk insert cannot be bigger than 16 megabytes. Considering you have 8 digits number, you can figure out what's the biggest bulk insert you can do!</p>

<p>Running 261 threads probably hurts your performance. After all, the 261 threads probably don't run in parallel (because.. I doubt you have 261 threads available, but who knows). Do more research of multi-threading, maybe using a simple parallel library with way less threads would even be faster. I've got to admit I'm not an expert in threading myself, but I'm pretty confident running 261 threads will simply hurt your performance, these threads need to be managed!</p>

<p>Now, there are a couple things that bother me with your situation :</p>

<ul>
<li>How many files do you have? If you have like... a million files with 271 lines each, you should consider pre-processing the whole thing to reduce the number of file access necessary. I'd even consider keeping only 1 file.</li>
<li>If you have <span class="math-container">\$2.71*10^8\$</span> 8 digit numbers and, I didn't have my morning coffee yet, there are <span class="math-container">\$9*10^7\$</span> possible combinations of 8 digits, you would have a lot of duplicates. Are you sure there isn't a simpler way to insert your data than reading 271000000 8 digits numbers from files?</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyways, I think the main thing you need to consider is using bulk insertion, which brings me to my final tip : Read the documentation of whatever database engine you're using. They are big pieces of code and it's pretty sure you will find something interesting to help you.</p>

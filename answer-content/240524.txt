<p>I think what you need is to replace this:</p>

<pre><code>  for feature in chicago_community_areas['features']:
      polygon = feature['polygon']

      # Return the name associated with this polygon
      if polygon.contains(point):
          return feature['properties']['area_numbe']
</code></pre>

<p>with a fundamentally different algorithm. The loop above is O(n), which is - as you have noticed - impractical for the quantity of data you need to process. You need a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_database#Spatial_index" rel="nofollow noreferrer">spatial index</a> to reduce the time complexity of this lookup to be sublinear. For Python in particular, there is <a href="https://geopandas.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">GeoPandas</a>, although I have not tried it so cannot speak to its quality or application to your task. This will require some research on your behalf, and I'm afraid that there is no easy answer other than to do a bunch of reading and experimentation.</p>

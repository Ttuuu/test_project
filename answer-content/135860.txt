<p>I want to mention only one thing especially:</p>

<p>You're using "magic string" to choose your filter types. Instead of doing that (because it's brittle) you are probably better off with an enum:</p>

<pre><code>public enum FilterType {
    USER, WORD, HIDE_WORD
}
</code></pre>

<p>Your code would have to adjust a little, but to give a short look into the filter method:</p>

<pre><code>private void filter(Filter filter, Conversation conversation, String outputFilePath) {
    switch (filter.filterType) {
        case FilterType.USER:
            conversation = Filter.filterByUser(conversation, filter.argumentValue);
            writeConversation(conversation, outputFilePath);
            break;
        case FilterType.WORD:
            conversation = Filter.filterByWord(conversation filter.argumentValue);
            writeConversation(conversation, outputFilePath);
            break;
        // ...
</code></pre>

<p>This exposes another small improvement possibility in your code.</p>

<p>In every case you will call <code>this.writeConversation</code> with exactly the same arguments. You can move that to outside the switch-case block:</p>

<pre><code>switch (filter.filterType) {
    // ...
}
this.writeConversation(conversation, outputFilePath);
</code></pre>

<p>Another last thing I want to recommend is using <code>Path</code> intead of <code>String</code> to refer to <code>outputFilePath</code>. This makes it blatantly obvious, that you're  actually referring to a File. Strings are .. not Paths...</p>

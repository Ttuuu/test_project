<blockquote>
  <p>I want to know if I should delete this script and make a new one with prepared statements.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, definitely.<br>
This set of functions is just unacceptable, being so bad on so many levels. </p>

<ul>
<li>There will be <em>dozens to hundreds</em> connections made in your script, not just "2 connections" for starter, as your code will connect anew every time it executes a query. </li>
<li>There is, as you rightfully noted, no support for prepared statements, which is a disaster alone. That escaping routine is based on the false notion that mysqli_real_escape_string's purpose is to protect you from SQL injection. Well, it's but a <a href="https://phpdelusions.net/top#escaping" rel="nofollow noreferrer">grave delusion</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://phpdelusions.net/articles/error_reporting" rel="nofollow noreferrer">error reporting</a> is completely flawed. What a <em>site user</em> is supposed to do with a blank page telling them that a column not found?</li>
<li>a <code>DBRead()</code> function is silly. All its purpose is to save you a typing of two words. <em>Seriously?</em> And this trifle gain at the expense of making a gibberish out of the powerful language of SQL.</li>
</ul>

<p>To show 2 records from a table (as it's stated in the code as opposed to the question title) you need only two lines with vanilla PDO, so you better stick with it:</p>

<pre><code>$sql = 'SELECT * FROM publicacao ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 2';
$dadosUN = $pdo-&gt;query($sql)-&gt;fetchAll();
?&gt;
&lt;?php foreach ($dadosUN as $UN): ?&gt;

//some html here to display the records

&lt;?php endforeach ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>There are some things that seem unclear or can be improved.</p>

<ul>
<li>Lots of typos and lots of inconsistent formatting make this harder to read than it should be</li>
<li>Not a fan of the "I" prefix for interface classes but that is purely subjective</li>
<li>Why is there an interface for everything? Do you plan to extend this heavily in the future?</li>
<li>Why initialize <code>IUser</code> in the ctor but other classes via ctor init list?</li>
<li>You could possibly pass and return more arguments by reference</li>
<li>As previously suggested you can use a for each loop</li>
<li>Possibly change to actual include guards</li>
<li>As previously suggested mark classes you don't intend to derive from any more as <code>final</code></li>
<li>Mark virtual functions you override with <code>override</code> and possibly <code>final</code></li>
<li>Why are you using <code>this</code>?</li>
<li>Missing initialization for some members</li>
<li>Not sure about your use of factory. AFAIK they excel at defered creation of complex objects and are not really used to their full potential here</li>
<li>Don't compare to <code>nullptr</code></li>
<li>Don't use <code>std::endl</code> unless you need to flush </li>
<li><code>system("pause");</code> is Windows only</li>
</ul>

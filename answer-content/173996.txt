<p>You helpfully offered an English specification, that spoke of initialization, use, and regeneration.</p>

<p>The code is attempting to maintain invariants related to that spec. It would be helpful to see tests which verify such invariants, or at least javadoc or comments that describe them.</p>

<p>In place of <code>e.printStackTrace()</code> swallowing an exception, I would prefer to see <code>throw new RuntimeException(e)</code> where that is acceptable. In <code>useToken()</code> one could perhaps catch something narrower than <code>Exception</code>.</p>

<p>I can't say I'm very fond of <code>useToken(tokenConsumer, false)</code>. It seems more like <code>useToken()</code> should have a <code>while (True) { ... }</code> loop, or while not finished or something. It could have a goal of always refreshing the token when less than 50% of its lifetime remains, prior to attempted use, and then the <code>catch</code> would be more about reporting fatal unexpected error than about retrying.</p>

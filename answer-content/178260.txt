<p>Not a full review, but some initial thoughts:</p>

<p><strong>Structure</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>You define <code>SPECPOWER</code>, but still hardcode the value inside methods. This will surely lead to bugs if you decide to change only the field.</li>
<li>Is there equipment that can be on or off, but which doesn't consume power? If not, I would pull power into equipment (and rename it). If yes, I would add a generic electronic device class. Either will get rid of the duplicate <code>getPowerConsumption</code> implementation. </li>
<li>I don't like that <code>getTotalPowerConsumption</code> and similar methods need to know about the specific devices (lights, airconditioners). If you need to add say a security camera later on, you will need to add it in many places, and forgetting some will lead to bugs. Possible solutions would be to put all devices in a devices list (which might cause performance issues if you only want to get one specific type), or a different structure such as a map. Your constructors would also need to change then.</li>
<li>Why does a floor have <code>switchedOFFACs</code> when the corridors already have the ACs? This doesn't seem necessary and is confusing. Also, is there a reason that it is a queue?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Documentation</strong></p>

<p>You don't have any. I would think about adding javaDoc comments to at least some methods. Eg what does <code>getMaxPower</code> do? And how is it different from <code>getTotalPower</code>? You probably know now, but will you remember in a couple of months? </p>

<p><strong>Naming</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Try to be consistent with your names, eg:<code>AC</code> vs <code>Airconditioner</code></li>
<li>I wouldn't use reverse hungarian notation (but if you do, it should be consistent); <code>mainCorridorMap</code> should simply be <code>mainCorridors</code>. This is especially confusing as there are things called floor maps, but your <code>floorMap</code> field doesn't contain one.</li>
<li><code>Address</code> seems like a confusing name. I don't think that you need it at all, but if you do, maybe <code>CorridorLocation</code>?</li>
<li><code>clearMotionEvent</code>: Here, we aren't really dealing with any events. I would probably rename it to <code>turnLightsOff</code>, and <code>motionDetected</code> to <code>turnLightsOn</code>. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Misc</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Always use curly brackets, even for one-line statements. Not using them can cause bugs. (but if you disagree, you should be consistent)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>InsertFront</strong>:</p>

<p><code>m_head</code> should always point to the first node. So <code>while (firstNode-&gt;m_previous != nullptr)</code> loop looks unnecessary to me. If you're concerned about having <code>m_head</code> changed by the caller then i would make <code>m_head</code> private and provide getter method for that. Than you can merge if/else blocks as they are very similar.</p>

<p><strong>InsertEnd</strong>:</p>

<p>Instead of iterating to find the last node every time (which makes it O(n)), you may maintain another pointer which always points to the last node. After that you may merge if/else blocks.</p>

<p>AFAIK following style of initializing class variables are more preferred.</p>

<pre><code>LinkedList(): m_head(nullptr) {
}
</code></pre>

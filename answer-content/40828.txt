<p>When I test your collection against a list using <code>Where</code>.  <code>Where</code> out performs your collection by a large factor.  For instance 1,000 queries, with each one returning 1,000 records from a collection with 1,000,000 random elements takes less than 1 ms, whereas FindValue takes about 15 ms.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Ok with iterating the FastCollection does individual searches better. </p>

<p>Did some more thinking on it.  One of the reasons it seems so blindingly fast, is you're hiding the extra time and resources building a lookup table for each property you want to search by.</p>

<p>One thing to consider is keeping your data in a DataTable instead of a list and use the Select method.  This allows for very fast searches with times that are comparable to your class, when you factor in the extra time building the lookup table.  However now it's in a format ready made for display in a DataGridView, or exporting to an xml file.  One caveat is that the data is returned as a collection of DataRow, which might be a bother depending on what you intend for the data.</p>

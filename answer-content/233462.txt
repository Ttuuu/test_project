<p>Personally, when iterating possibilities, I always use <code>SELECT CASE True</code> instead of nested <code>If</code> and <code>Else</code> statements to just have a list of possibilities for readability purposes.</p>

<p>Performance might not be 100% optimal, since this can lead to slightly more comparisons, but I will gladly take that to have more readable code.</p>

<pre><code>Public Function IsDistinct(LeftValue As Variant, RightValue As Variant) As Boolean
    Select Case True
        Case IsNull(LeftValue) And IsNull(RightValue)
            IsDistinct = False
        Case IsNull(LeftValue) Or IsNull(RightValue)
            IsDistinct = True
        Case LeftValue = RightValue
            IsDistinct = False
        Case Else
            IsDistinct = True
    End Select
End Function
</code></pre>

<p>Note that because I'm iterating possibilities, I prefer not to do <code>IsDistinct = Not (LeftValue = RightValue)</code> but only assign literals for readability (I'll just have <code>Case Condition Then Literal</code>), but if you don't care, you can of course save two lines.</p>

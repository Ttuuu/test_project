<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>Here's what I came up with. It runs in O(n) because of the for each loop, and seems to be a nice readable option to me.</p>

<pre><code>numberList = [1, 19, 93, 44, 2885, 83, 379, 3928]

def largestNumber(value):
    string = ''
    for number in value:
        string = string + str(number)
    result = ''.join(sorted(string, reverse=True))
    return(int(result))


print(largestNumber(numberList))


Output: 99998888754433332211
</code></pre>

<p>Your solution works in the same time complexity, so they are both on the same page in that regard, but stringing the values together and using python's built in sorting function saves some space and complexity.</p>

<p>There's a lot more duplication here than I'd expect.  The processing of rows, columns, forward diagonals and reverse diagonals are all very similar to each other, particularly once the coordinates are linearised to an index into <code>grid</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>rows have a step of 1 from one element to the next</li>
<li>columns have a step of <code>columns</code> (or, in general, the "stride" of the array)</li>
<li>diagonals have a step of <code>columns Â± 1</code> depending on their direction.</li>
</ul>

<p>The other difference is the start and end margins to prevent advancing beyond the 2D bounds of the array; these are easily adjusted according to the direction.</p>

<hr>

<p>We ought to be more robust when reading inputs in <code>getGrid()</code>.  We could test <code>std::cin</code> after reading from it, or simply set it before reading to throw exceptions on failures.</p>

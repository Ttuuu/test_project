<p>The code is very C-style.  It accepts raw arrays.  Indexes should not be of type <code>int</code>.  Closed intervals are unidiomatic in C++.  Since this is C++ code, use iterators and STL containers instead.</p>

<p>It may also be a good idea to randomize the choice of the pivot value to avoid the dead case of already sorted array.  This can be done by swapping the last element with another randomly selected element before partitioning.</p>

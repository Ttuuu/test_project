<p>The second implementation looks complete but wrong - <code>Instance()</code> dereferences an uninitialized pointer.  You probably meant:</p>

<pre><code>static T &amp;Instance()
{
    static T myInstance;
    return myInstance;
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>There's no need to delete the move construction and assignment - deleting the copy construction and assignment will prevent the move versions being automatically generated.  (But you might prefer what you have as being clearer to future users).</p>

<p>There's certainly no need for a virtual destructor, or even a constructor - the only useful member is the static <code>Instance()</code>.</p>

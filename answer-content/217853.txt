<p>I'm severely confused by <code>array.move_down</code>, because I don't see any array or anything moving anywhere. If you are doing a <code>super_list</code>, wouldn't it be more readable to have <code>sublist.begin</code> and <code>sublist.end</code>?</p>

<p>Also I don't like fail-later approach with hiding an exception. If user makes an error in nesting lists, I would fail fast instead. It's a common behavior of all the languages I know (with an exception of early/ancient HTML).</p>

<p>Not sure how relevant this is, but I saw one small issue in the original script (possibly elsewhere):</p>
<p>In the comparison with top, grep is used to filter out results, but "hardcoded" to mysql, which doesn't seem to be generic... i.e.</p>
<pre><code>proc = subprocess.Popen("top -p %s -b -n 1 | grep -w **mysql** | awk '{print $9}'" % pid, shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
</code></pre>
<p>I'd suggest replacing "mysql" with the process name that is linked to the PID in question.</p>

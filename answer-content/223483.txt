<p>I find the problem you are trying to solve to be as hard to grasp from the code presented as from the description:<br>
- <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#comments" rel="nofollow noreferrer">document your code</a>, using the conventions of the language (&amp;environment) of choice.<br>
- use telling names</p>

<ul>
<li>In the <code>for</code>-loop, you don't use <code>i</code>: don't use <code>enumerate()</code>.</li>
<li>I think the first comprehension easier to understand with <code>reading</code> (? "<code>r</code>") mentioned first:<br>
<code>measurement = (y for y in self.records if reading.&lt;predicate&gt;(y))</code></li>
<li>I think it confusing to use the same identifier for unrelated objects in one and the same statement - suggesting <code>if not any(reading in n for n in new):</code></li>
<li>instead of <code>if &lt;condition&gt;: &lt;pass&gt; else: &lt;act&gt;</code> do<br>
<code>if not &lt;condition&gt;: &lt;act&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>compare_record_same_name()</code> is a horrible name, as it mentions only half of what the function checks. It seems it is there to check whether the other record belongs to the same "measurement" - name it for that: <code>same_measurement()</code>.</li>
<li>instead of converting <code>duration</code> to seconds each and very time, make <code>TIME_SEPARATOR</code> a <code>timedelta</code></li>
</ul>

<p>I'd try a different approach:</p>

<ul>
<li>readings with different instrument names do not belong to the same measurement, anyway:<br>
use a separate collection for each name</li>
<li>sort each collection by time (hoping the method used makes good use of what order is bound to exist in input)</li>
<li>any gaps exceeding <code>TIME_SEPARATOR</code> separate measurements</li>
<li>if the time covered by any group <em>g</em> is too big for one measurement, split at large internal gaps or evenly by number of readings or time range or â€¦</li>
</ul>

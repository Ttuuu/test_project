<p>A few things I noticed:</p>
<p>You're printing the password directly to the console.  I would suggest, you get much more versatility by returning the password as a string.  This way the user of the function can decide how or if the password gets displayed. For instance, displaying the password on a web page, or hashing it and storing it a database.</p>
<p>You haven't set any format limits on the password, just the length.  Typically, besides the length, there are requirements for a minimum number of each type of character, capitals, lowercase, digits, and punctuation.</p>
<p>You wastefully repeat the array holding the digits for the <code>pinGenerator</code> function.  In fact you can dispense with all the arrays except the one for punctuation. Simply set the max limit of <code>random.nextInt</code> to 26 or 10 and add 'a','A','0' to get the appropriate char.</p>
<p>I would suggest holding all the different types of characters in <code>char[]</code>'s.  This way you can create a <code>char[]</code> for the password and create a string from that.</p>
<p>Likewise with your menu choices, expecting a <code>char</code> requires a lot less validating.</p>
<p>Instead of using a <code>try-catch</code> block and all those <code>if-else</code> blocks to validate the users choice(s), a simple <code>switch</code> will do the job much more easily.  The <code>try-catch</code> block isn't made for this kind of validation and adds an extra degree of overhead to your code that isn't needed.</p>
<p>Only use 1 instance of the <code>SecureRandom</code> class as a private global field.  I'ts wasteful to keep seeding a new instance every time the functions are run.</p>

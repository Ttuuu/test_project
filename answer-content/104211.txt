<p>I didn't entirely understand how this was meant to work, so I dove right in and ran it through the interpreter, interactively using it.</p>

<pre><code>normal_method(2, 6)
&gt;&gt;&gt; (2, 6)
&gt;&gt;&gt; {}
&gt;&gt;&gt; 12
</code></pre>

<p>Immediately I have no idea what's going on. Why get an empty dictionary? What's <code>(2, 6)</code> and what's <code>12</code>? You should be distinguishing inputs from one another and checking if there even are any. A rudimentary change might be:</p>

<pre><code>if self.debug:
    if args:
        print ("[args]")
        pprint(args)

    if kwargs:
        print ("[kwargs]")
        pprint(kwargs)
</code></pre>

<p>That's not stylistically very nice but it's more revealing than just spitting out parameters with no indication of what they are.</p>

<p>Also I tried out passing <code>debug=False</code> and it just... does nothing. Why is this an option? It's either a redundant way of allowing you to remove the debugging function or it's a poorly explained distinction. The actual decorator should be removed if you don't want to debug, not just added but entirely disabled.</p>

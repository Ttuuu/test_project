<p>Better complexity can be achieved using a heap. The input array can be organized into a min-heap in <span class="math-container">\$O(n)\$</span> time with negative integers dropped. Then the smallest number can be popped one by one until the target number is found. The complexity of this algorithm is <span class="math-container">\$O(n + klogn)\$</span> where <span class="math-container">\$k\$</span> is the insertion index of the target number among the sorted sequence of positive numbers.</p>

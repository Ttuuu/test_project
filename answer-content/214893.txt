<p>This problem is an instance of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Integer Linear Programming</a>. ILP is NP-hard, so an algorithm to find the optimal solution will not be much faster than brute-force. However, a common technique to find an approximate optimum is to solve it as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Linear Programming</a> problem without the integer restrictions, then round the results up or down as necessary. Fortunately, many <a href="http://www.phpsimplex.com/en/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">libraries</a> exist to solve non-integer LP quite efficiently.</p>

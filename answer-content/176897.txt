<p>Instead of opening <code>sys.argv[1]</code> yourself, consider taking advantage of the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/fileinput.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>fileinput</code></a> module.  Your code will be more versatile, accepting input from standard input or from multiple files.</p>

<p>Also, you are reading the entire file into memory at once. Processing the text a line at a time would scale better to large files.</p>

<p>Converting the result to a <code>dict</code> would scramble the order, so don't do that.</p>

<pre><code>import collections
import fileinput

def find_most_common_words(lines, top=10):    
    """Return the most common words in the lines of text."""
    words = collections.Counter()
    for line in lines:
        words.update(line.lower().split())
    return words.most_common(top)

top_five_words = find_most_common_words(fileinput.input(), 5)
</code></pre>

<p>As per <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/#one-line-docstrings" rel="noreferrer">PEP 257</a>, docstrings should be worded in the imperative rather than the indicative mood, and should be delimited with three double-quotes.</p>

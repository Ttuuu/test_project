<p>You want something to be pythonic? It seems you would like to have a one liner. Simple AND elegant is more pythonic in my opinion. </p>

<p>The "most" pythonic in my opinion would be this:</p>

<pre><code>choice = []
for choice_index in sequence:
    if choice_index &gt;= len(choices):
        break
    choice += choices[choice_index]
</code></pre>

<p>For a one-liner? I will wrap it in a function and use that like this for repetitive work.</p>

<pre><code>def generate_choice_list(choices, sequence):
    choice = []
    for choice_index in sequence:
        if choice_index &gt;= len(choices):
            return []
        choice += choices[choice_index]
    return choice
</code></pre>

<p>This has the added advantage of eliminating wrong entries with the sequence list, like returning empty list for incorrect sequence list.</p>

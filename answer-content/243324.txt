<p>This Java program is well written but appreciate an Algorithm behind it.</p>

<p>When I see this it appears that workers take the task to process, but they 
need a thread and if we have method like a Factory method to assign a thread then that would look more cleaner. In this case we are checking if the worker is free and that use the thread of that worker can be checked inside the Factory method just like there is a Factory method for connection pools. The Flags for is busy and running can be made available to the Factory method as arguments.</p>

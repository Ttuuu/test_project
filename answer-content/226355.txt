<p>I see the point of the commenters: why implement this, if it has already been implemented? However, I still see benefit for such a question in an interview process. Given the right analysis, you can see how the developer thinks and what question he asks, which is IMHO more important than the actual code.</p>

<p>Questions could be:</p>

<ul>
<li>What coding guidelines shall I follow?</li>
<li>Besides that single line description, do you have acceptance criteria?</li>
<li>Which unit test framework shall I use?</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>public class Date : IEquatable&lt;Date&gt;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Such low level classes use to be <code>sealed</code>. Could apply here as well.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>public static int MaxDays(int month, int year)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Why make it <code>public</code>? The purpose of the class is to add days. There's nothing in the task that qualifies this method to be part of the API, IMHO. Make it <code>private</code> instead.</p>

<hr>

<p>The class hardly useful, because one cannot access the properties of the changed date. There are no accessors for <code>_month</code>, <code>_day</code> and <code>_year</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Comments: do you expect XML-doc comments on public (API) methods? You don't have them.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>// [...] thinking about using in constructor for validation.
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>What would you do if it's invalid? <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/77797/480982">Throw an exception</a>? Well, Microsoft does it ...</p>

<hr>

<p>Magic number:</p>

<pre><code>if (month == 2)
</code></pre>

<p>Introduce a constant <code>February</code> to give it semantics.</p>

<hr>

<p>I write code in some languages and operator precedence is always an issue. The line</p>

<pre><code>if ((year % 400 == 0) || ((year % 4 == 0) &amp;&amp; (year % 100 != 0)))
</code></pre>

<p>is hard to understand. A method <code>IsLeapYear()</code> might help you out of that:</p>

<pre><code>private static IsLeapYear(int year)
{
    if (year % 400 == 0) return true;
    if (year % 100 == 0) return false;
    if (year % 4 == 0) return true;
    return false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>At the same time it gives sematics to the magic numbers.</p>

<hr>

<p>Why do we have <code>AddDays()</code> but not <code>SubtractDays()</code>? Can I pass a negative number for subtracting, or is subtracting not allowed? </p>

<p>Your code does not seem to support subtraction, but the data type is still <code>int</code> and not <code>uint</code>.</p>

<hr>

<pre><code>return new Date(day, month, year);
</code></pre>

<p>Do you expect immutability? Why? For performance reasons / multi threading? Is this premature optimization? Immutability comes at the cost of garbage collection.</p>

<hr>

<p>Magic number:</p>

<pre><code>if (month &gt; 12)
</code></pre>

<p>What if the interviewed person uses <code>_daysInMonth.Length</code>? Is that better or worse than your implementation?</p>

<hr>

<p>Hash codes etc.: do you provide an IDE which can generate equality members (like Jetbrains R#), or do you expect the developer to come up with that prime stuff by himself?</p>

<p>I have never written such code myself and actually I don't want to work in a company that expects me to write such code (except I'm applying to some security company which <em>has</em> to deal with hashes and encryption).</p>

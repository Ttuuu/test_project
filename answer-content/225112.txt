<p>The <code>push</code> function may invoke undefined behavior. When you create a new <code>std::string</code>, I don't think it is guaranteed to be null-terminated since that would incur a runtime cost for no benefit other than C compatibility. Only after calling <code>c_str()</code> the terminating null character is there. Because the string is really empty, calling <code>back()</code> accesses an out-of-bounds element.</p>

<p>You claim that your code works for <span class="math-container">\$-2^{63}\$</span> but you didn't add that number as a test case. I would expect it to not work since <code>-(-2**63)</code> is still negative.</p>

<p>Besides these two issues, your code reads well and is easy to understand. Adding the additional documentation was a very good idea for everyone not fluent in Japanese.</p>

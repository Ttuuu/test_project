<p>The most important part of Clean Code is that your code should be easily understood. The author's indication about the number of parameters of a function is meant to be something like: "Better no parameters than one parameter. Better one parameter than two. You should avoid more than two parameters whenever it's possible"</p>

<p>For the function that checks the input <code>bool IsNotNullAndNotEmpty()</code> it would be more readable if you give it a parameter. It would read as: "is this thing null or empty". If you don't give it any parameter, maybe the name should be <em>ValidParameterLines</em></p>

<p>There are more important guidelines in that book. For example, your code does more things than sort in that function, doesn't it? </p>

<ul>
<li>It filters the input excluding the empty</li>
<li>It groups the input by the element at the indicated position</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't really see the sorting part if I tell you the truth. I think that the function does something like classifying the parameters grouping them by a positional value.</p>

<p>What I'm trying to say is that the name of the function is misleading. That's a more important part of the Clean Code. You must write code that can be understood at first glance.</p>

<p>I hope that helps you</p>

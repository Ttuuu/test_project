<p>The worst problem is probably the use of the <code>SortedSet</code> collection. In my experience, the <code>Sorted*</code> collections are rarely what you really want and the performance is questionable.</p>

<p>The performance can be greatly improved if all the cell's neighbors have a unit distance to cell (or the a small integer distance). Then you have a queue of <em>frontiers</em> that can be processed/updated fast and straightforward. There is a sample implementation called <code>DelayQueue</code> here: <a href="https://github.com/Ark-kun/Ark.Collections/blob/master/Ark.Collections/DelayQueue.cs" rel="noreferrer">Ark.Collections.DelayQueue</a>.</p>

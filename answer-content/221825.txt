<p>Your style is that of Google. It's simple and consice. However, I have a few remarks.</p>

<ol>
<li>The <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/01/color-theory-for-designers-part-1-the-meaning-of-color/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">color classes</a> are in conflict. You have a mix of warm (red) and cold (blue) colors.</li>
<li>There is no warning when the user has <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_detect_capslock.asp" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Caps Lock</a> on when typing in the password.</li>
<li>You are missing support functions as 'Need help logging in' and 'Stay logged in'.</li>
</ol>

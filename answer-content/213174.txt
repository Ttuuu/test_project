<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>There would be a problem in your code for following inputs:</p>

<pre><code>10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
5
3 2 1 10 9
</code></pre>

<p>The answer which would show is NO while the answer should be 4.</p>

<p>This is because once <code>flag</code> is set to 1, the program will not move to next smallest number (here 2) but instead would print "NO".</p>

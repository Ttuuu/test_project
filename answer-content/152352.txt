<p>Assuming that:</p>

<ul>
<li>you only have two possible results</li>
<li>you can't have two files with the same name</li>
</ul>

<p>Then you only need to iterate once and then make the set difference between the results.
Something like:</p>

<pre><code>all_files = set([File(file) for file in files_within("./_input/")])
MAP["resolved"] = [file for file in all_files if file.extension.lower() == "gdb"]
MAP["rejected"] = list(all_files - set(MAP["resolved"]))
</code></pre>

<p>Note: I didn't test this, it's just the general idea.</p>

<p>EDIT: As pointed out, the original code stores <code>File</code> objects, not file paths.</p>
    </div>

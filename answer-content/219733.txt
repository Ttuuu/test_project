<p>The function <code>RemoveNonAlphaNumeric</code> promises to remove non-alphanumeric characters. It does this in an incomplete way.</p>

<ul>
<li>The comma is not removed.</li>
<li>The apostrophe is not removed.</li>
<li>The em-dash â€” is not removed.</li>
</ul>

<p>There's probably a function <code>Character.IsDigit</code> and <code>Character.isLetter</code> that is more appropriate. In the end, whether it is appropriate or not depends on what the code is supposed to do at all. What do you need it for, why do you want to remove non-alphanumeric characters in the first place?</p>

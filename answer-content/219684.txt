<p>Some lints:</p>

<ul>
<li>Uppercase names are by convention only for <code>export</code>ed variables.</li>
<li>You can use <code>getopt</code> to parse parameters. This should make it easier to handle optional parameters, and also makes it easy to avoid positional parameters (which makes commands more self-documenting).</li>
<li><a href="https://mywiki.wooledge.org/Quotes" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Use More Quotesâ„¢</a></li>
<li>I would guard against errors and accidents by using <code>set -o errexit -o noclobber -o nounset -o pipefail</code> at the top of the script.</li>
<li><code>return</code>ing anything other than an <em>exit code</em> is a problem. You function should instead <em>output</em> the value (and ensure other output goes to standard error). One issue is the semantics of conflating exit codes. The other is the lingering bug because exit codes <em>wrap around</em> after 255.</li>
<li>You can use <code>mktemp --directory</code> to create a temporary directory to store intermediate results. Even better would be to pass results in a pipeline to avoid any temporary files.</li>
</ul>

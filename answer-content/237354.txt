<p>Don't use <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/1452721/5231607"><code>using namespace std;</code></a>.</p>

<p>Since <code>is_prime</code> only has two possible return values, and given its name implies a binary result, it should return a <code>bool</code>, not an <code>int</code>.  Then replace the return statements with the proper bool values.</p>

<p>When checking for primes, you only need to go up to the square root of the number to check.  This value can be computed once then used in the loop condition, or you can check for <code>i * i &lt;= num</code>, although this has the potential to overflow with sufficiently large <code>num</code>.</p>

<p>The check for 0 or 1 can be simplified to <code>if (num &lt; 2)</code>.</p>

<p>Before the loop, you can check <code>num</code> to see if it is divisible by 2 and return an appropriate value.  Then you loop can start at 3 and increment by 2 (so you only need to check the odd numbers).</p>

<p>You should declare your variables as close to the place you first use them as possible, so your loop could be</p>

<pre><code>for (unsigned long n = 3; ...
</code></pre>

<p>(or <code>for (auto n = 3UL;</code>).</p>

<p>When getting input, rather than <code>while (1)</code> with repeated conditions in the loop, you can say <code>while (!cin.fail())</code> and not check for that within the loop.</p>

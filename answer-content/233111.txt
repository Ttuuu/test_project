<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>There's an unmatched <code>(</code> in the declaration of the contents of <code>story</code>.  I recommend that you actually test the DTD using a validating parser such as OpenSP before posting code for review.</p>

<p>6.1 is not satisfied: you have declared content for <code>story</code> but no attributes.</p>

<p>6.2-6.4 are not satisfied: the <code>url</code>, <code>title</code> and <code>preview</code> elements must each appear <strong>exactly once</strong>.</p>

<p>6.6.1 is not satisfied: you only allow <code>content</code> before <code>video</code> and not <code>video</code> before <code>content</code>.</p>

<p>7.1 is not satisfied, because <code>title</code> has been declared as an empty element.</p>

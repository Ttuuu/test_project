<p>Of course it's too low. You're building <em>all</em> the sequences of n numbers â‰¤ el_maxim and then display only those increasing. So, for m=5 and n=3 you print ten sequences out of 125, but you build and check all those 125.</p>

<p>Build them incrementally: once you've set the first array element to 1 you only need to iterate from 2 to e_m - (n - 2) for the second element; and once that latter reaches 3, then the third element only goes from 4 to e_m - (n - 3), etc. And you wouldn't need to check them (which btw you currently do twice, first time discarding the result of the check).</p>

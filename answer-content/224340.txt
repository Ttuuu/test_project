<p>I don't mind the other two answers but I felt like there was a better way to do this.  Consider using a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp" rel="nofollow noreferrer">dictionary</a> where the key will be the selection and the value will be what that selection beats.</p>

<p>So the <code>dict</code> will be:</p>

<pre><code>choices = {
    'paper': 'rock', # paper beats rock
    'rock': 'scissors', # rock beats scissors
    'scissors': 'paper', # scissors beats paper 
}
</code></pre>

<p>This <code>dict</code> can simplify a lot of our logic.</p>

<p>First lets get the user's choice. The following loop makes sure the <code>user_choice</code> is a valid choice by making sure it is in our <code>dict</code>.</p>

<pre><code>user_choice = None
while user_choice not in choices:
    user_choice = input(f'Please enter one of the following ({", ".join(choices)}): ')
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <code>', '.join(iterable)</code> notation may be confusing.  All we are doing is joining all the dictionary keys together to make one string using ', ' as the delimiter. This results in the following output:</p>

<pre><code>Please enter one of the following (paper, rock, scissors):
</code></pre>

<p>Now lets let the computer choose an option. Similar to Josay's answer, we can use random's <code>choice</code> to do this; however, because a dictionaries keys are basically a <code>set</code> we need to first turn our keys into a list (or tuple).</p>

<pre><code>from random import choice
computer_choice = choice(list(choices))
</code></pre>

<p>Great, now we have both choices. Now for the winning logic, which gets simplified because of our <code>choices</code> dict:</p>

<pre><code>if user_choice == computer_choice: # If both choices are the same then its a draw
    print("DRAW")
elif choices[user_choice] == computer_choice: # If the computer's choice is what the user's choice beats
    print("PLAYER WINS")
else: # else the computer must have won
    print("COMPUTER WINS")
</code></pre>

<p>Putting it all together:</p>

<pre><code>from random import choice

choices = {
    'paper': 'rock', # paper beats rock
    'rock': 'scissors', # rock beats scissors
    'scissors': 'paper', # scissors beats paper 
}

user_choice = None
while user_choice not in choices:
    user_choice = input(f'Please enter one of the following ({", ".join(choices)}): ')

computer_choice = choice(list(choices))
print(f"The computer chose {computer_choice}")

if user_choice == computer_choice:
    print("DRAW")
elif choices[user_choice] == computer_choice:
    print("PLAYER WINS")
else:
    print("COMPUTER WINS")
</code></pre>

<p>Final output:</p>

<pre><code>Please enter one of the following (paper, rock, scissors): paper
The computer chose rock
PLAYER WINS
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of checking for division by 2 and 3 separately twice, you can make use of the fact that:</p>
<p><span class="math-container">$$ 2 * 3 = 6$$</span></p>
<pre><code>num = int(input("enter number"))
if num % 6 == 0:
    print("Divisible by 3 and 2")
elif num % 3 == 0:
    print("divisible by 3 not divisible by 2")
elif num % 2 == 0:
    print("divisible by 2 not divisible by 3")
else:
    print("not Divisible by 2 not divisible by 3")
</code></pre>
<p>python <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#id17" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pep8 suggests to use 4-whitespace</a> nesting as indentation levels.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use 4 spaces per indentation level.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>If you have more numbers to check divisibility against, keep a set of the numbers for which <code>num % x == 0</code>, and print the factors at the end.</p>

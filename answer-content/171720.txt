  <p>Is there a way to make the substitution faster? E.g. ... Combine some of the regexes</p>

<p>Both of (NON_BREAKING, ONE_SPACE) substitute the same replacement expression, as does the triple ({OPEN,CLOSE}_PUNCT_RE, CURRENCY_SYM_RE). This suggests there may be an advantage to combining the two or three regexes. A larger number of regexes use <code>r' \1 '</code> as the replacement, so that may yield a larger win.</p>

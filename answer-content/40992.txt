<p>In addition to what others already have mentioned, I just have a few things to add:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Magic numbers. Why 7? Where does that come from? Why 6? (There are 20-sided dice as well). Declare these numbers as constants, usually any number that's not 0 or 1 (and even those too sometimes, for when you don't have a good reason for using 0 or 1).</p>

<pre><code>private static final int DIE_SIDES = 6;
private static final int TARGET_NUMBER = 7;
</code></pre>

<p>Then instead of writing 6 or 7 in other places of your code, write <code>DIE_SIDES</code> or <code>TARGET_NUMBER</code> instead. Also, if you want to make it more flexible later (and more object oriented as @200_success suggests - which I agree on), you could make these <em>instance</em> variables instead of static variables by simply removing the <code>static</code> keyword.</p></li>
<li><p>Consistent spacing. I find that it is harder to read:</p>

<pre><code>totalSum=totalSum+theSum;
</code></pre>

<p>than to read</p>

<pre><code>totalSum = totalSum + theSum;
</code></pre>

<p>You use good spacing in most of your code. Stick to that.</p></li>
<li><p>Your use of division and the argument. On one place in the code, you parse <code>args[0]</code> as integer, but here you parse it as double: (also note the fixed spacing!)</p>

<pre><code>double average = (double)totalSum / (Double.parseDouble(args[0]));
</code></pre>

<p>It seems to me quite clear that you always want to parse it as an integer, as it is the number of times to throw. And it doesn't make sense to throw 3.47 times, or 9.17 times, does it? I understand you wrote this line to avoid the resulting number becoming an integer, as <code>int / int == int</code> in Java. </p>

<p>But as <code>double / int == double</code> and <code>int / double == double</code> you only need to typecast one of them to double, for simplicity, let's go with <code>totalSum</code>. And as @user36245 pointed out, you should only parse the number once and use it as a variable, this will also improve the readability of the line.</p>

<pre><code>int numberOfThrows = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
...
double average = (double)totalSum / numberOfThrows;
</code></pre>

<p>Now it is easier to tell what we are dividing :)</p></li>
<li><p>Shorter addition. Instead of writing <code>totalSum = totalSum + theSum</code> you can write <code>totalSum += theSum</code>. Also, for cases when you just want to increase by one, as in <code>count = count + 1;</code> you can use <code>count++;</code></p></li>
</ul>

<p>I must say though, as I want to give a compliment also, that you're code is quite well formatted. You know where to put braces and parenthesis and you know how to indent your code properly, good! Keep on learning more things!</p>

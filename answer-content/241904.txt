<p>An interesting use of <code>Enum</code>s!</p>

<p>My only concern with using <code>Enum</code> would be performance -- as you note, all possible values are created when the class itself is created, so if you use a big number then you could also be using a <em>lot</em> of memory.</p>

<p>Otherwise, your <code>__dunder__</code> (aka magic) methods look good, you don't need the reflected methods (e.g. <code>__radd__</code>) since only the exact same types are used in the operations, and I can see nothing wrong.</p>

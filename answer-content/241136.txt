<p>Welcome to codereview Ragnar!
This was a fun one</p>

<p>Using list comprehensions, you can create a list that contains a tuple with 3 values:</p>

<ol>
<li>Distance to x </li>
<li>Index of the tuple </li>
<li>x value</li>
</ol>

<p>So then you can order the list, and take as many items from the tuple as desired</p>

<pre><code>x = 6
points = [(4,6),(2,5),(0,4),(-2,3)]
closest_points = sorted([(x-xvalue[0], index, xvalue[0]) 
                        for index, xvalue in enumerate(points)])
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can slice the list and take values from there</p>

<pre><code>closest_points[:2]
&gt; [(2, 0, 4), (4, 1, 2)]
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, you would take:</p>

<ul>
<li>0 as index of first element, 4 as the x value</li>
<li>Then 1 as index of second element, 2 as value</li>
</ul>

<p>Divisors come in pairs. Since 2*50 = 100, both 2 and 50 are divisors to 100. You don't need to search for both of these, because once you've found that 100 is divisible by 2, you can do 100 / 2 to find 50, which is the other divisor. So for every divisor you find, use division to find its "partner" at the same time. That way you don't need to look further than the square root of x:</p>

<pre><code>for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1):
    if x % i == 0:
        divisor1 = i
        divisor2 = x // i
</code></pre>

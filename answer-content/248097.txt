<p>I'm not sure how helpful I can be here, but IMHO you need to have a full fledged code review with someone talking you through the code. There's a bunch "wrong" here, but having said that I'm wondering what your aim is with C# - are you just scripting something quick out to learn the syntax, or are you wanting to better understand how to architect things in C#.</p>
<p>If someone came to me with this in a professional setting the first thing I'd tell them: "You need to be able to test this". I would then talk about TDD, and really try to point out how this code is structured to do way too much. There's no abstractions, and everything is very procedural. Every class should do 1 thing. People I'm sure will argue with me on this point. Either way, the fact that you only have 1 class is bad.</p>
<p>Past that, for just general "2 minute quick C# tips". I'd use enumerations for the cards so instead of 10, 10, 10, I'd have 10, Jack, Queen, Ace. Use var instead. <code>if (cont1 == true)</code> is the same as <code>if(cont1)</code>. Use better named variables: Just looking at cont1 I have no idea what that means.</p>
<p>JansthcirlU also brought up collections. Looking at this code, it doesn't look like you understand them so I would really focus here as well.</p>
<p>Keep coding :)</p>

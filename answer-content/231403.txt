<p>It is difficult to review something without understanding the scenario it is going to be used in. So, please regard this as just some random thoughts which may or may not be relevant:</p>

<ol>
<li>Waiting inside <code>Task.Run</code> is almost never a good idea. You consume a thread from a thread pool to do nothing. Try using an event loop if possible.</li>
<li>In <code>SendWithReply</code> I don't see where the tasks are run. Also it looks like it copies a lot of code from <code>Send</code></li>
<li><code>AddHandler</code> is not thread-safe. If two threads write to the same key, one might fail and never know about it</li>
<li>Can't think of any use for the Sent callback, because by the time it is called the tasks might have already been finished</li>
</ol>

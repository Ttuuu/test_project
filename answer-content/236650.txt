<p>Your code is generally fine. <code>Console</code> is a resource used by your class. You clean up after usage. But your code is far from being perfect and seems to have some design flaws.</p>

<p>You have to check what <code>IDisposable</code> is primaryly designed for: to free application resources like memory of <em>unmanaged</em> resources. <em>Unmanaged</em>  means the garbage collector is not tracking the life cycle of specific object instances and therefore not managing their reserved memory, making them become <em>unmanaged</em> instances. 
Also sometimes you have reusable and long living resources, like a database connection instance. You can control the object instance's life cycle yourself. You can use it to make multiple requests without creating a new connection each time, as creating a connection has some overhead and might be expensive.  </p>

<p>So, let's say you reuse the connection object instance during each session. When the session ends, you want to end its life cyle too n order to free underlying resources like application memory.<br>
That's when you choose to dispose it. This is where you choose to implement <code>IDisposable</code> rather than implementing a <code>finally</code>satement <code>inside</code> the class which owns the unmanaged resources. This is how you delegate resource management to the client class which is usiing the resource owner. The client class can then decide when to dispose ie. free the unmanaged resources by choosing between a <code>finally</code> statement which needs to explicitely invoke <code>Dispose()</code> on the resource owner or a <code>using</code> statement which implicitely invokes the <code>Dispose</code> method after leaving the <code>using</code> scope.</p>

<p>But for single isolated operations (method calls) you don't need to dispose the instance since its life cycle is already limited to a single isolated call. In this case you would prefer to use a <code>finally</code> statement to clean up after execution of the operation.</p>

<pre><code>class ConsolePrinter
{
  public ConsolePrinter(ConsoleColor color)
  {
    this.ConsoleForegroundColor = color;
  }

  private ConsoleColor ConsoleForegroundColor { get; set; }

  public void Print(string message)
  {
    // Remember the current console foreground to immediately revert it after use
    // in order not to interfere with other instances of this class,
    // which might have a differenet foreground set
    var currentConsoleForeground = Console.ForegroundColor;

    try
    {
      Console.ForegroundColor = this.ConsoleForegroundColor;
      Console.WriteLine(message);
    }
    finally
    {
      Console.ForegroundColor = currentConsoleForeground;        
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is a far better class design.<br>
From the design perspective:</p>

<p>if the modified value for the static class <code>Console</code> is not meant to be global, then set it directly where it is used and reset it right after the operation is completed. Encapsulating the setting of a static class into a seperate class doesn't make sense. It's actually not a color object but a color setter or attribute. It should rather be a property on some class which uses it (see example).</p>

<p>Your current code doesn't forbid to create multiple instances of the class. By your current design each instance would override the color value set by every other instance. So to prevent this it should be a <code>static</code> class. But since the original property <code>Console.ForegroundColor</code> is alread <code>static</code>, you can deduct that your class is a redundant wrapper. You already can set <code>Console.ForegroundColor</code> from any scope which leads back to the above example code as the preferred usage.</p>

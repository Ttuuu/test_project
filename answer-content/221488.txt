<li>Yes, but you don't need it.</li>
<li>It is good that your intuition tells you to give this function this long a name: It tells you to get rid of it. While you can't get rid of it, keep the name long as a symbol of shame.</li>
<li><code>factors</code>.</li>
<li>Annotations.</li>
<li>Right before. If all goes well, your definition will have form <code>foo = bar $ _</code> where <code>bar</code> is some library function that tells the experienced reader what sort of definition he's looking at, much like the type does.</li>
<li>They do not directly help speed, but in my estimation can make it easy to make code simple/short, and therefore easy to improve in any direction.</li>
<li>Parentheses do not influence compilation noticably. Optimize for readability.</li>

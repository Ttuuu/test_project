<p>My review is focused on <code>linkedlist.c</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some functions don't check for null pointer (<code>get_node_val</code>, <code>set_node_val</code>). While it's documented, other functions do check for null pointer.</li>
<li>The functions to append and prepend nodes require the caller to call the function to create a node. It might be a better idea to create the node in the function and to return the newly-created node.</li>
<li>The function <code>append</code> does not return the new node while the function <code>prepend</code> does.</li>
<li>The data can only be an integer; having a void pointer on the listed data allows to have any type of data. However, this change would make your search function unusable.</li>
<li>Printing the data is a way of handling the data. It seems that this is the role of the caller.</li>
<li>You may want to consider having a function to return the length of the list.</li>
</ul>

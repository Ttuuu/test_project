<p>The two main things that a control object gives you is 1) easier access to setting properties and 2) automatic HTML encoding, at the cost of more lines of code (in general).  In your case, the HTML is simple enough and there are few enough branches that I'd be ok with the LiteralControl approach.</p>

<p>The one thing to watch out for is that your alt and title strings could easily contain apostrophes (maybe it's not likely in English, but do you localize to French?), and that will break your HTML.  I like to keep the string tables clean of formatting, so that means the values have to be encoded before rendering.  If you use the control objects, this will be taken care of.  If you use the string approach, you have to explicitly call an encoding function.  All strings should be run through this function, even if none of the current translations have any problem characters.  If there are strings that never need encoding (because they are e.g. widths or positions that depend on the language) put those in a separate string table.</p>

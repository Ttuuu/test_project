<p>Well, generally it is not a problem to call a sync method within async method.</p>

<p>You are actualy doing this in more then few instances (GetExtension, NewGuild, ToString, etc...)</p>

<p>But if you have an async method available it would be shame to not use it.
Which you have - <code>IFormFile.CopyToAsync()</code>.</p>

<pre><code>using (var bits = new FileStream(path, FileMode.Create))
{
  await file.CopyToAsync(bits);
}
await _imageCropBlackBroderService.CropBlackBroderOfAnImageAsync(sourceFolderPath, destinationFolderPath);

</code></pre>

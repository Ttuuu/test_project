<p>Nice recursive solution! Just a few suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li>You should structure you entire code better and set up individual functions to set up the menu and get the prices, not do it all in <code>main</code>.</li>
<li>Ideally, you would add a docstring that describes what your function does and what the parameters are. I personally like the <a href="https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">numpy docstring style</a>.</li>
<li>Function names should be <code>snake_case</code>, not <code>CamelCase</code>, so it would be <code>get_plu(data)</code></li>
<li><code>data</code> is a very generic term, you should use something more descriptive such as <code>menu</code></li>
<li>If you want the type comparison <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1549801/what-are-the-differences-between-type-and-isinstance">to also work for inherited types</a>, you should use <code>isinstance(data[item], dict)</code> instead of <code>type(data[item]) == dict</code></li>
<li>Remove the space in <code>print (data[item])</code></li>
<li>Your function should return something meaningful or <code>None</code>. Perhaps you want to also save the prices in a list or set, or you want to at least <code>return 0</code>, which commonly means that the function ran successfully.</li>
</ul>

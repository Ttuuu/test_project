<p>The amount of comments you use is more distracting than helpful. Good comments are those that explain what the overall logic of a block of code is, they don’t explain each line of code. Code is supposed to be self-documenting, that is, the code should explain itself. You accomplish this by using good variable names and good function names, which explain their own meaning.</p>

<p>Also, you need to use the functionality in the standard library. For example, to test whether a character is a normal letter or not, use <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/string/byte/isalpha" rel="nofollow noreferrer">isalpha</a> rather than the four comparisons you’re using (against <code>'a'</code>, <code>'z'</code>, etc.)</p>

<p>Generating and handling exceptions is considered to be an expensive operation, so <code>if(! x.ContainsKey())</code> is better. Yeah, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/k7z0zy8k(v=vs.110).aspx" rel="noreferrer">the code example I see in MSDN</a> uses try/catch but that's to illustrate the exception not advocate that as "best practice."  Documentation I've read is pretty adamant about not throwing exceptions needlessly.</p>

<p>And you don't need try/catch to trap the duplicate key; just an <code>else</code> to the above <code>if</code>.</p>

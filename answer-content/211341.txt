<p>what is the problem with just creating a range of random number generators from <code>&lt;random&gt;</code> and assign each to a thread? </p>

<p>Mind that using <code>thread_local</code> might not be a good way, as initialization of random number generators is costly. Also i do not know, how therngs would be seeded in a <code>thread_local</code> environement.</p>

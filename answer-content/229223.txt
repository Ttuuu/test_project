<p>One drawback I can think of this way of logging is that (correct me if I'm wrong) it is lazy. That's to say, until the root <code>Op</code> object is <code>Disposed</code>, all of the log items are kept in memory. This means that you are relying entirely on the functionality of the topmost <code>using</code> statement to ensure the log gets properly written somewhere. If due to some external error your process happens to exit unexpectedly, you might end up losing your entire log.</p>

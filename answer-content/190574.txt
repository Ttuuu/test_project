<p>Here is a functional version. Javascript has quite a lot functional type functions that can help you out here. It could probably made to be even nicer, but this was my first approach </p>

<pre><code>function updateFilters(currentFilters, newFilter) {
  const hasName = filter =&gt; filter.name === newFilter.name;
  const foundIndex = currentFilters.findIndex(hasName);

  return foundIndex === -1
    ? currentFilters.concat([newFilter])
    : currentFilters.splice(foundIndex, 1);
}
</code></pre>
    </div>

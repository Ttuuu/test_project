<p>Since @spyr03's <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/245062/98493">extensive (and awesome) answer</a> did not include it, here are some small comments.</p>
<p>You want this to be an example for your students of how code should look like. You should include a <code>docstring</code> with every class, method and function to detail what it does and what it's arguments and return value are. Although your code <em>is</em> rather self-documenting, this sets the precedent for when they write their own code. If you consistently do it (and require it of them), some may learn to do it.</p>
<p>Don't forget to teach them about writing (good) tests either, at least eventually. Especially the pieces would be a good easy candidate for tests. They have complex non-trivial behavior which you could mess up when changing something, so having full test coverage on them would be very helpful.</p>
<p>On a practical note, I was slightly surprised when I came to the <code>Pawn</code> class. First, you define these nice mixins for the movement types. But then,  the <code>Pawn</code> class does not to use any of them! I understand that the pawn is probably the first piece you want to define, and also that it is a bit hard to use the mixins in this case, but I would consider if it wouldn't be better to start with a piece that actually uses one of the mixins. Or define them later, when you actually need them.</p>

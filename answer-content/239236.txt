<h2>Global code</h2>

<p>This stuff:</p>

<pre><code>pygame.init()

# Create a screen
win = pygame.display.set_mode((800,700))
win_info = pygame.display.Info()
win_w, win_h = win_info.current_w, win_info.current_h
pygame.display.set_caption("Pong")
</code></pre>

<p>should be moved into one or more functions. These:</p>

<pre><code>pad_colour = (255,255,255) #White colour

pad_distance = 50
speed = 10
running = True
fps = 30
</code></pre>

<p>can probably stay in global scope as ALL_CAPS constants.</p>

<h2>Class names</h2>

<p><code>border</code> should be <code>Border</code> since it's a class name. The same goes for <code>Paddle</code>.</p>

<h2>Statics</h2>

<pre><code>class border(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
    width = win_w
    height = 10

    def __init__(self,width, height, colour):
</code></pre>

<p>I don't think that the first width/height variables do what you think they do. Currently they can be deleted. If you want them to take effect as defaults, then you'd actually write</p>

<pre><code>class border(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
    def __init__(self, colour, width=win_w, height=10):
</code></pre>

<h2>Method names</h2>

<p>should be snake_case, i.e.</p>

<p><code>random_movement</code>, <code>collide_pad</code>, etc.</p>

<h2>Don't repeat yourself</h2>

<p>The code to check the left/right pad is very repetitive. Think about what is shared and what differs, and factor out the differing stuff. So far as I can see, the differences include the references to the key constants <code>K_s</code>, some distance calculations, etc.</p>

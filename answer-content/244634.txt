<p>At first glance, here are the few things I saw that need to be fixed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your functions seem pretty long, and this possibly leads to violation of single responsibility principle. Make sure each of them does only a single job.</li>
<li>There are many <code>magic numbers</code> (such as using 0:3, 0:4 while slicing arrays). Same applies to your strings too. As someone who reads your code, I do not understand how/why you used them. Obviously, this is because such usages decrease understandability of your code. Defining constant variables might be needed.</li>
<li>Your variable names are not descriptive enough. Avoid using names such as <code>aa</code>, <code>temp</code> etc.</li>
<li>Name your functions by verbs not by nouns. For example, instead of <code>sparta_formater</code> use <code>format_sparta</code>.</li>
<li>Divide your program into modules. Do not write everything in a single file, separate them according to what they do.</li>
</ol>

<p>first of, I'm not really sure what your code does, at least not the first part. I'm also unsure if you wonder of the number of bits set, or the number of actual bits? The code under here does both:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys, math

def least_significant_bit_is_set (number):
    return (n &amp; 1 == 1)

n = int (sys.argv[1])

#calculate number of set bits
bits_set = 0

while n &gt; 0:
    if least_significant_bit_is_set (n):
      bits_set += 1
    n = n / 2

print bits_set

n = int (sys.argv[1])
# calculate total number of bits
bits = 0
if n &gt; 0:
    bits = int (math.log (n,2)) + 1
print bits 
</code></pre>

<p>the <code>n = n/2</code> could also be substituted by <code>n &gt;&gt;= 1</code> to show that we are pushing the integer to the right, thereby loosing the least significant bit</p>

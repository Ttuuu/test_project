<p>I'll tell you, I definitely had trouble reproducing your expression. The Refiddle you linked to was using JavaScript's regex engine, not <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/pcre.pattern.php">PHP's PCRE</a>.</p>

<p>Now, what you're doing is something that is complicated. Just so everyone knows, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-fonts/">here is the official documentation</a> regarding fonts of the web.</p>

<p>If we dig a little, we will <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-css3-webfonts-20020802/#font-descriptors">find</a> a sentence saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Therefore, only the range of ISO 10646 characters will be used to
  qualify matches for the font face name.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, the definition of "ISO 10646" will <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Character_Set">give us something like</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Universal Character Set (UCS), defined by the International
  Standard ISO/IEC 10646, contains nearly one hundred thousand abstract
  characters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the way I see, your check of <code>\w</code> doesn't cover this. The documentation <em>you</em> linked to specifically say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some font formats allow fonts to carry multiple localizations of the
  family name.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the example directly below that covers the locale of (I'm pretty sure) Japan. The <code>\w</code> word check often relies on the user's localization configuration, which is in no way subject to a single standard.</p>

<p>I don't know how you're using this information, but if it's to just style a page, let the user enter what they want. The page will break harmlessly and it will be their loss. Styling with a <code>/*</code>  or <code>DROP TABLE</code> will only make their webpage less stylish! If you're storing this information, same principle goes, just make sure to used prepared statements when inserting into your database.</p>

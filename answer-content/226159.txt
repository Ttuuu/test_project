<p>An alternative not discussed in the other answers: use <code>numpy</code>. As soon as you want to do anything serious with numbers, it's going to be useful. The downside is that <code>numpy</code> uses fixed-size integers, which can lead to overflow. It also allocates the array, which uses more memory than necessary.</p>

<pre><code>import numpy as np

def sum_square_difference(n):
    nums = np.arange(1, n+1, dtype=int)
    return nums.sum()**2 - (nums**2).sum()
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to input very large numbers, or have access to very little memory, just use the analytical formulas for the sums:</p>

<pre><code>def sum_square_analytical(n):
    sum_squares = n*(n+1)*(2*n+1)//6
    square_sum = (n*(n+1)//2)**2
    return square_sum - sum_squares
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, you can add docstrings and comments, as suggested in other answers. </p>

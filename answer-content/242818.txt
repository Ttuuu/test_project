  <p>The question is do you think I can code?<br>
  Become a programmer ?<br>
  I mean do I have the right mind for it ?<br>
  do you think I'm any good at this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, but code review is more on the code than the programmer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I know the style is awful and the code is very messy too, but your opinion is very important to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Use an auto formatter.</strong></p>

<p>Many coding environments have one.  Tip: well formatted code makes a good impression.  Do not manual format - life is too short for that.</p>

<p><strong>Enable all warnings</strong></p>

<p>As well suggested by @user3629249, this saves you time and avoids learner mistakes.</p>

<p><strong>Validate range from users</strong></p>

<p>Users are notorious for bad input. Do not trust the input until vetted.</p>

<pre><code>#define CARD_MAX 9999999999999999  /* Or whatever your limit */
if (get_card &lt; 0 || get_card &gt; CARD_MAX) {
  printf("This credit card is not valid \n");
}
</code></pre>

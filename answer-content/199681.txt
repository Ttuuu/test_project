<p>For sure, there are easier solutions. </p>

<p>On the other hand, it seems you want to implement the algorithm from scratch â€¦ I try to bring these together.</p>

<p>Therefore, as a reviewer, I'd ask to think about the iterations (times) you need to look at the elements:</p>

<p>You obviously need to compare each element to every other element. Therefore the double nested loop is in the first place justified. Maybe you can memoize the results of some comparisons already made by using a suitable data structure, e.g. a tree, map or alike.</p>

<p>But why twice? Maybe think into the direction of reusing variables for other purposes. That can be discovered in your code multiple times. usually that is a source of problems. Give the variables one single distinct purpose and think of how you can rewrite it then.</p>

<p>To be more precise, with these regards:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <code>isDuplicate</code> is reused as an attribute for each next array element in a new iteration. You lose it in a new iteration and have to recalculate. Typically one stores the values then.</li>
<li>the <code>numberOfDuplicates</code> is reused as array index when building up the result. While not hinting to a better algorithm, the style/readability is a bit affected here and points towards the general rule of thumb. </li>
</ul>

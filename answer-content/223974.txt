<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>I would have the <code>now.minute != 0</code> as an else since the <code>if</code> above is the exact opposite case.</p>

<p>I would also assign a 'sleep_time' value inside both branches and call the sleep function after the <code>if - else</code> to emphasize that sleep is always done.</p>

<p>I also don't like <code>while True</code> since it means I have to search the code for the exit condition.  I would have the <code>now = datetime.now()</code> line twice, one before the <code>while</code> and once at the end of the block and make the condition <code>while now.hour != 23:</code>.  This is personal, some people are more against the duplicated line than the <code>while True:</code>.</p>

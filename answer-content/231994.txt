<p>The first thing to improve about your <em>code</em>/<em>procedure</em> is <em>readability</em>.<br>
<em>Not</em> "just" for others trying to understand your code, but for your latter self should you want to maintain it.<br>
<em>I</em> don't know the first thing about R. The first style guide a superficial web search turned up is from <a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Hadley Wickham's <em>Advanced R</em></a>, characterised as <code>short and sweet</code>.</p>

<p>Things I think to harm readability:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>(lack of) <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/231950/r-optimize-algorithm-speed-that-estimates-hourly-temperature-and-relative-humid#comment452744_231950">structuring source code by formatting</a></p></li>
<li><p>(lack of) documentation in the source code: What is "everything" about?<br>
What is the <em>problem</em> to solve, the <em>sequence of well-defined steps</em> perceived to solve it?</p></li>
<li>abbreviated names without an illuminating comment: is "hr" for <em>hour</em> or  <em>humidity, relative</em> or something entirely else?<br>
<code>hx</code> seems to be <em>four hours before sunset</em> - what does the x signify, and why 4 hours?</li>
<li>in-line arithmetic with <em>magical constants</em>: while I can guess that <code>lat*(3.141592653589793/180.0)</code> is <code>radian(</code><em><code>latitude in degrees</code></em><code>)</code>, I'd rather not.<br>
What is the significance of 10 in <code>dayIndex + 10</code>,<br>
0.39 in <code>tMax - 0.39*(tMax - tMinNext)</code>, why isn't the latter just <code>0.39*tMinNext + 0.61*tMax</code>?</li>
<li>computing things that don't get used<br>
The only things I see used (pasted to <code>hrResult</code> - see below) are <code>hr</code> and <code>tSum</code>;<br>
<em>some</em> code struggles with <code>HumHr</code>/<code>HumTm</code> and "their Accum counterparts".</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the code is readable, one can start pondering performance impact:<br>
Is there anything straining the memory hierarchy?<br>
Do costly actions get repeated instead of results reused?<br>
Then, there is general advice like <em>Use Vectorisation</em>,<br>
and (resource demand) pitfalls - using <code>paste()</code> to accumulate the result may be one.</p>

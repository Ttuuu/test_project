<p>I prefer to have at least one print statement per line of output. Instead of:</p>

<pre><code>print('line1\nline2\line3')
</code></pre>

<p>I would rather write:</p>

<pre><code>print('line1')
print('line2')
print('line3')
</code></pre>

<p>That way, when there is a large block of output on the screen and you want to find it in the file, it's obvious where in the code it might be.</p>

<hr>

<p>Going to sleep before doing the actual work is dishonest. There is no benefit of having <code>sleep(3)</code> in the code, it's just wasting the user's time.</p>

<hr>

<p>From a technical viewpoint, asking for the name of the user is unnecessary.</p>

<p>The next question is unnecessary as well since the user, if they choose not to produce a mandala, can always quit the program at any time.</p>

<p>The question about the angle should suggest some useful numbers or at least a range, to help people who don't like math.</p>

<p>The following line is a bold lie:</p>

<pre><code>print("Determining features... \nColor... \nSize...")
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>By using the word <em>mandala</em>, you made me expect a colorful image with curved lines, the lines painted in black and the areas between filled with colors. Just drawing some straight lines doesn't qualify as a mandala for me. That part is something you should invest some work, to create beautiful images.</p>

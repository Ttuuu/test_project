<p>A couple of minor notes:</p>

<p>1) Add proper typing so that users of your code will be able to type-check their own code correctly.  I think this would look like:</p>

<pre><code>from typing import Dict, List, TypeVar

_KT = TypeVar('_KT')
_VT = TypeVar('_VT')

class DoubleDict(Dict[_KT, _VT]):
    super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
    self.values_dict: Dict[_VT, List[_KT]] = defaultdict(lambda: [])
    for key, value in self.items():
        self.values_dict[value] += [key]

... etc
</code></pre>

<p>2) I'd eliminate the <code>index</code> syntactic sugar, personally, because it makes it easier for the caller to forget that this isn't a one-to-one mapping in both directions.  Make them get the list and check to make sure that it's got the length they expect.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you'd <em>want</em> it to be a one-to-one mapping in most cases, then enforce that in the setter and make it part of the class's contract.</p>
    </div>

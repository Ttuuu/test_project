<ul>
<li><p>You are not implementing standard (aka Las Vegas) rules. According to the standard rules, a player's hand of an Ace and a honeur forms a blackjack, and must be disclosed immediately. I am not even talking about the split and insurance rules.</p></li>
<li><p>You don't give the player an opportunity to wrap up, collect her fortune and go home. The game continues until she is stripped off completely.</p></li>
<li><p>I am afraid there are more monsters than you are aware of. To begin with, I don't see a clean MVC separation. A litmus test is to evaluate efforts required to port this code from <code>curses</code> to, say, <code>Tk</code>.</p>

<p>Besides, <code>draw_screen</code> has no business to count hands' values, or to be concerned with the dealers' open card. This information shall be computed by the model, and passed to view in an appropriate form.</p></li>
<li><p><code>count_hand</code> is suspiciously similar to <code>is_busted</code>. I expect</p>

<pre><code>def is_busted(....):
    return count_hand(....) &gt; 21
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>count_hand</code> is also overcomplicated. Consider</p>

<pre><code>def count_hand(hand):
    aces = 0
    hand_sum = 0
    for card in hand:
        if card.is_ace():
            aces += 1 # Initially count all aces as 1
        hand_sum += card.value
    # Now try to assign come aces an extra 10 points
    while aces &gt; 0 and hand_sum &lt;= 11:
        aces -= 1
        hand_sum += 10
    return hand_sum
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how having <code>card</code> itself an instance of the class helps.</p></li>
</ul>

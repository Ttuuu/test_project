<p>Assuming you've sorted out the indentation I would do a few things to the code as is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Separate the import from the rest of the code, grouping stuff that belongs together is super useful for readability when it comes to more complicated code.</li>
<li>Think about whether you need to use <code>str</code>, does it add anything to the code? I'd avoid that and instead just use the int instead.</li>
<li>Think about the variable name <code>coin</code>. I'd say that the result of the coin flip is not the coin itself so the name <code>coin</code> could be confusing if this was part of something bigger. I would use <code>coin_flip_result</code> or something similar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some ideas for extending/changing the code:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use enums (see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html" rel="noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html</a>) for the result of the coin flip (named e.g. <code>CoinSide</code>), which would allow you to completely skip the if statements and just have something like:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>coin_flip_result = CoinSide(randint(0, 1))
print("Coin flipped! It's " + coin_flip_result.name)
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>If you haven't already, try doing FizzBuzz (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz" rel="noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Congrats on writing your first bit of code!</p>

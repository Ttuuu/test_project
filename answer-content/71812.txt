<p>Instead of using a boolean to flag if something is something (and thus implying that it isn't the other thing), consider an <code>enum</code>; in this case that doesn't buy you anything in terms of flexibility (since it's not as if there will ever be, say, red or purple or whatnot) but it will make your code much more clear.</p>

<p>On the game, instead of setting black and white separately, you should have a single <code>setPlayers(Player black, Player white)</code>, or better yet, have the board be a factory that provides the black and white <code>Player</code>s itself - if there's even a reason to have a Player object in the first place.</p>

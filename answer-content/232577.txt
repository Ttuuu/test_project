<h2>Is comparator.use { a &gt; b } more readable than comparator.compare(a, b) &gt; 0?</h2>

<p>Readability is relative and more a point of view. Usually something is considered more readable, the more people say it is.  </p>

<p>In my personal opinion both solutions are easy to read, while I like the syntax of the first more. Actually something very similar exists in the language already: <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.comparisons/compare-by.html#compareby" rel="nofollow noreferrer">compareBy</a></p>

<pre><code>list.sortedWith(
  compareBy{ it.a }.thenBy { it.b }.thenByDescending { it.c }
)
</code></pre>

<p>It has all combinations you need and provides a nice, well readable syntax.</p>

<h2>Is it a good idea to replace <code>use</code> with <code>invoke</code> operator or make this function <code>infix</code>?</h2>

<ol>
<li><code>use</code> isntead of <code>invoke</code></li>
</ol>

<p>It is opinion based, just like readability. Its up to you and your team.</p>

<ol start="2">
<li>Infix</li>
</ol>

<p>Making a function an <code>infix</code> function is just another customisation option for your syntax. The only important thing to remeber is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Infix function calls have lower precedence than the arithmetic
  operators, type casts, and the rangeTo operator. The following
  expressions are equivalent:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>1 shl 2 + 3 is equivalent to 1 shl (2 + 3) </li>
  <li>0 until n * 2 is equivalent to 0 until (n * 2) </li>
  <li>xs union ys as Set&lt;&gt; is equivalent to xs union (ysas Set&lt;&gt;)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>On the other hand, infix function call's precedence is
  higher than that of the boolean operators &amp;&amp; and ||, is- and
  in-checks, and some other operators. These expressions are equivalent
  as well:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>a &amp;&amp; b xor c is equivalent to a &amp;&amp; (b xor c) </li>
  <li>a xor b in c isequivalent to (a xor b) in c</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Any improvement suggestions that you can think of</h2>

<p>Strongly consider to use <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.comparisons/compare-by.html#compareby" rel="nofollow noreferrer">compareBy</a> like described before.</p>

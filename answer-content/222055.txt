<h2>General feedback</h2>
<p>This code looks okay, though it could utilize more features of <a href="/questions/tagged/ecmascript-6" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'ecmascript-6'" rel="tag">ecmascript-6</a>, like <code>for...of</code> loops and default parameters (see below for more detail). Nothing jumps out as far as a way to consolidate the code in those two methods to check the collision positions but I wonder if you could consider flipping values in one of those instances in order to find similarities, though maybe that would make it even more complex.</p>
<h2>Targeted feedback</h2>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Default_parameters" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Default parameters</a> could be used to avoid lines like this in the constructors:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>options = options || {};
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Instead of using <code>Array.from()</code> in <code>checkShipArray()</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>arr = Array.from(new Set(arr));
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax" rel="nofollow noreferrer">spread syntax</a> can be used to avoid the function call:</p>
<pre><code>arr = [...new Set(arr)];
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p>The call to sort the array in <code>checkShipArray()</code> could be moved after the validation checks to avoid excess processing.</p>
<hr>
<p>Many of the <code>for</code> loops could be transformed into <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>for...of</code></a> loops, to simplify access of array elements. I wish that syntax supported access to the index but it doesn't seem that is the case, and thus the loop in the class <code>Feld</code> (typo?) would need to manually increment such a variable if that was converted.</p>
<p>The functional method <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Array.filter()</code></a> could be used to rewrite the <code>for</code> loop in <code>getRequiredShipsListAsText()</code>- it does allow access to the iterator counter (i.e. <code>i</code>).</p>

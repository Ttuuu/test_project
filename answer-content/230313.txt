<p>Regarding your idea of creating a <code>CitySettings</code> class: from introducing such a class, you'd have only moved the problem - now you have a CitySettings constructor with 9 constructors. Not an improvement.</p>

<p>Further possibilities: if a significant number of the fields are optional, create a builder-pattern. (Do not do this, if all parameters are mandatory, as an object should be completely usable after creation.)</p>

<p>If you find a <em>meaningful</em> subset of the parameters (e.g. startingPos, size, edgeLength might be somehing like <code>GeographicalBounds</code>) you can create a class for these and reduce the parameter count.</p>

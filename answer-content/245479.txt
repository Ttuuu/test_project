<p>I think you're on the right-track by using DI for unit-testing and you should just stick to it instead of only using it for testing.</p>
<p>Instead of having a parameterless constructor you could only have the constructor that receives an implementation (of IAzure) to which you can easily pass mock implementations for Unit Testing and add an extra layer of decoupling to your code base.</p>
<p>By sticking to DI for your class you can not only add mock implementations but you can also create "middleware" classes that implement the interface, do some extra work (like logging) and then forward the request to an actual implementation, for example.</p>

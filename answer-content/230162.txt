<p>Most of what I say here is covered in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP8</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>In assignment statements, surround an "=" with a space on either side.</li>
<li>Function parameters are separated by a comma followed by another space</li>
<li>If <code>'''To swap value'''</code> is a docstring, it needs up one line.</li>
<li>Comparison operators like "&lt;" also need a space on either side.</li>
<li>Use variables with meaningful names. a, lis, j, and i are not meaningful.</li>
<li>Comma seperation in tuple assignment should also have a space after each comma.</li>
<li><code>if i==0:</code> can be replaced with <code>if not i:</code></li>
</ul>

<p>I myself lack experience with sorts and time-complexity, so I'll leave that to others.</p>

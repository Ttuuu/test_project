<h2>One-based indexing</h2>
<p>Based on this:</p>
<pre><code>int places[10] = {'o', '1', '2', ...

"\n\n"
,  places[1], places[2], ...
</code></pre>
<p>it seems that you're trying to push a square peg (one-based indexing) through a round hole (zero-based indexing). Try to use zero-based indexing instead.</p>
<h2>Assuming ASCII</h2>
<p>This:</p>
<pre><code>places[i]-48
</code></pre>
<p>assumes that you're using ASCII for the compiler character literal encoding. That is often a correct assumption, but not necessarily a safe one. Since you have tested this on Linux it is likely that you are using gcc, so you should read about the <code>f*charset</code> options, and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12216946/gcc-4-7-source-character-encoding-and-execution-character-encoding-for-string-li">this question</a>.</p>
<p>Aside from explicitly setting ASCII as the encoding, you should replace the above 48 with <code>'0'</code>.</p>

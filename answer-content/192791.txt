<blockquote>
  <p>is there a more efficient method to write the code rather than repeating the cumbersome boolean logic shown below?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. Yes there is. Think about the logic at any given question/answer and make it work for every question/answer. The result will be a single function.</p>

<p>We are at question #2:</p>

<ul>
<li>Evaluate the previous question's answer:

<ul>
<li>NO:  display this question</li>
<li>YES: hide this question</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Make that a function. Call it for every question, in order. Every time any question is answered always call it for all questions (in order) as this will handle arbitrarily changed answers. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To make more questions I need to copy and paste the code and change the boolean conditions and the Element IDs for each question.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. No you don't. Reuse the function; passing in 1) prev. question's answer 2) this question's ID. Perhaps the questions are numbered and that should suffice as an identifier.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Organize your code</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Build the question table separately as @AnthonyHaffey says</li>
<li>Add an event handler that calls that displayHide function. Every question uses this one handler.</li>
<li>A javascript array holding all the original questions. Pass that into the table building function.</li>
<li>Each question has a unique identifier. In the HTML table make an appropriate element property to hold it.</li>
</ul>

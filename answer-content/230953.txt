<p>One more thing I'd want to add. I don't think you want to use the whole <code>(__FILE__, __LINE__)</code> mess.</p>

<p>In a small codebase, you should be able to easily find the file and line via a simple search while in large codebase file/line info is just not sufficient.
Say, you have a file used in many places, then printing that an error occurs in this file is not very informative - you'd want the whole callstack or at least some partial ownership information.</p>

<p>So consider adding a second layer over the logger class - one that classes tend to keep a copy of. One that keeps a pointer to the interface; provides the functionality for composing the message from multitude of data; filtrates on-the-root messages that aren't going to be printed; and keeps an "owner" or "callstack" string and automatically adds it to the message so you can identify who actually prints the message, and not just file/line info.</p>

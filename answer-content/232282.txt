<ul>
<li>Streams close when they go out of scope. No need to call .close() at the end of the function.</li>
<li>File names can be provided when you create the streams. No need to pass 5 streams to a function (and risk mixing them up) for that.</li>
<li>You're passing way to many parameters into the functions that read from the file. Why not declare most of them in the body of the function? What is the hashtable iterator doing there as a parameter?</li>
<li>The result of <code>getline</code> is not checked after the call.</li>
</ul>

<p>As always, profiling helps identify bottlenecks. </p>

<p>Allocating all those strings can get costly. Reading the whole file in memory and using <code>std::string_view</code> might avoid that.</p>

<p>If the key is an <code>int</code>, how big is it? Perhaps a big enough vector is enough instead of the hash table.</p>

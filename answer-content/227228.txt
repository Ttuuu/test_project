<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<blockquote>

    get { lock (Sync) return _pointsCount; }
    set { lock (Sync) _pointsCount = value; }

<p>I wonder why this property has a <code>public</code> setter? Is there a scenario where setting this form the <em>outside</em> would make sense?</p>

<hr>

<p>Other things...</p>

<p>I like your exceptions. They clearly tell me what went wrong so I would instantly know how to fix that. You even have created a custom one <code>SettingsLoadingException</code>, kudos!</p>

<p>I would however change how you handle this:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>public static bool LoadedSuccessfully = true;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Make it <code>false</code> by default and set it to <code>true</code> only once when <code>TryLoad</code> succeeded. Currently you set it three time to <code>false</code> instead.</p>

<p>You could also flip the logic with <code>return true</code> and do it onyl once before the first <code>catch</code>, this is, inside the <code>try</code> and do <code>return false</code> only once at the end of the method.</p>

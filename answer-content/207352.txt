<p>Its always informative to comment the specific crc polynomial. An 8 bit crcs is only marginally better than 8 bit checksum.</p>

<p>First, remove the malloc() and memcpy(). A crc is a calculation that does not affect the input data. There is no need to allocate and copy the input data. Also, your code has a memory leak because its not releasing the allocated memory. </p>

<p>Second, just read each byte and update the crc calculation. There is nothing to gain with an arbitrary restriction on the input data size.</p>

<p>Third, replace the bit by bit calculation loop with a byte wide calculation.</p>

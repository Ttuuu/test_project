<ul>
<li>set <code>public $routes</code> to private or protected if its jsut an internal resource of this class. Just use public if other classes/code explicitly should call the mothod/property</li>
<li><code>method_exists</code> doesn't check if the method is callable. But that might be important if you execute legacy code</li>
<li>Avoid <code>echo 'some text'</code> Better use exceptions and an exception handler</li>
<li>If you use <code>if (){} else{}</code> you could think about using the if for the termination condition and the function continues regulary if its ok</li>
<li>Your note about the dependency injection cache is good. Keep your idea. You are on the rigth way.</li>
<li>I would recommend to use doc-blocks as annotation and for IDE autocompletion for all public functions as well as class properties. This will increase the readability </li>
<li>You didn't said which version of PHP you are using. Switch to &gt;= 7.1 because 7.0 will reach its end of life soon. So you should use return types and type hinting </li>
</ul>

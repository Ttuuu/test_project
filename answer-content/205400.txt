<p>If you want to be completely safe, I would also check the 'choice' to make sure that it was not a negative number.</p>

<p><code>Goto</code>'s should be avoided. You can easily refactor your code to use a <code>while</code> loop and <code>break</code>.</p>

<p>In your function <code>GameResult()</code>, I would use a <code>switch</code> statement instead of the <code>if</code> chain.</p>

<p>I am also thinking that <code>CheckWin()</code> might be a bit too cumbersome with all of the <code>if</code> statements and the checking of the individual cells. I might keep a "shadow board" behind the scenes, where a cell is 1 if it is an X and -1 if it is an O. Some simple addition and a test to see if the <code>Math.Abs(sum) == 3</code> is an easy way to test for a win. For example:</p>

<pre><code>if (Math.Abs(board[1] + board[2] + board[3]) == 3)
  result = Result.Win;
</code></pre>

<p>You can even refactor what I wrote above by keeping a list of the triplets to check.</p>

<p>Good luck with your studies of C#.</p>

<p>When you get lots of instances, it's not really practical to look through them all. What most Alloy users would do in this case is to add a constraint to the show predicate to see if you can get the instance you expect. So I modified it to</p>
<pre><code>pred show {
#connects &gt; 4
#requests &gt; 4
}
</code></pre>
<p>and now I see instances with more than 4 connects and requests.</p>
<p>Another suggestion: don't use exactly unless you really need to. You usually want to look for all instances up to some bound, and if you set it to exactly, you might find that you get no instances because it's not possible to construct one with exactly that number. For example, if you don't allow conference calls and you require phones to matched one to one, and you then set the bound to "exactly 3" you would get no solutions.</p>

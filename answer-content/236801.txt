<p>Classes <code>IgnoreUntilNewLine</code> and <code>SkipEmptyLineToEnd</code> can probably be simplified. Classic indicators for that are that it only has one function and no state. However, the key is the following <code>operator&gt;&gt;</code> <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_istream/operator_gtgt" rel="nofollow noreferrer">overload</a></p>

<pre><code>basic_istream&amp; operator&gt;&gt;( basic_istream&amp; (*func)(basic_istream&amp;) );
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, you read into a function. This is used by e.g. <code>std::endl</code> or <code>std::flush</code> as well. Using that, you only need a single function for each of the above two classes. The body of those functions is the same as the <code>operator&gt;&gt;</code> for the two classes.</p>

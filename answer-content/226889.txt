<p><strong>Don't use <code>using namespace std;</code>.  It is extremely bad practice and will ruin your life.</strong>  You will have trouble on common identifiers like <code>count</code>, <code>size</code>, etc.  See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/1452721">Why is “using namespace std;” considered bad practice?</a> for more information.</p>

<p>The input format is extremely awkward, but this seems to be beyond your control, so I'll leave it alone.</p>

<p>Instead of using a linear search as you are doing in your loop, it might be beneficial to do a binary search if the amount of data is large.  (This needs some testing.)  Also, use standard algorithms to make your code more readable.</p>

<p>Also, in this very case, a dynamic vector may not be the best way to appeal to the timer.  (I'm not sure how I would phrase that.)  <code>reserve</code> may help.  You can try using a static vector like <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/q/226757">this one</a> because you know that the size is below a limit.</p>

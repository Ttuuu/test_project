<p>Here is the answer based on @Quuxplusone's suggestion- thanks. Also, I don't understand why my question got downvoted without any comments, I'd appreciate if you add some comments why you did not like the question or what can be improved if you want to make a better community for all. So, I could improve my way of asking questions and wouldn't ask in the same style again. Thanks!</p>

<p>Since the method has a return value even if the code is not finished processing the first line of your javadoc ought not read "Get the time taken for process to complete" but perhaps rather "Get the current or total processing time" or something of that nature? I also agree with Bert F's comment, but if there were clear comments explaining the behavior and you don't intend on exposing start and end times individually then there's no reason to waste an extra variable; you can either keep the code as it is and add comments or optionally get rid of the boolean "processRunning" and instead use your completedTime/runTime variable to establish the fact that it's still running. All minor gripes, all in all.</p>

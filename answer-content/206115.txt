<p>EDIT: I've squeezed the filter a lot. I couldn't wrap my head around it before how to make sure something really fit within the time period. It's this: Start date BEFORE the END of the time period, and End date AFTER the BEGINNING of the time period</p>

<p>With the help of someone in my office I think we've figured out how to include everyone in the filter. 
There are 5 scenarios where a student would be deemed active during the time period in question: </p>

<p>1) Student started and ended during the time period.</p>

<p>2) Student started before and ended during the time period.</p>

<p>3) Student started before and ended after the time period.</p>

<p>4) Student started during the time period and ended after the time period.</p>

<p>5) Student started during the time period and is still active (Doesn't have an end date yet)</p>

<p>Given these criteria, we can actually condense the statements into a few groups because a student can only end between the period dates, after the period date, or they don't have an end date:</p>

<p>1) Student ends during the time period AND [Student starts before OR during]</p>

<p>2) Student ends after the time period AND [Student starts before OR during]</p>

<p>3) Student hasn't finished yet AND [Student starts before OR during]</p>

<pre><code>   (
        (
         student_programs.END_DATE  &gt;=  '07/01/2017 00:0:0'
         OR
         student_programs.END_DATE  Is Null  
        )
        AND
        student_programs.START_DATE  &lt;=  '06/30/2018 23:59:59'
   )
</code></pre>

<p>I think this finally covers all the bases and includes all scenarios where a student, or event, or anything is active during a time period when you only have start date and end date. I've attached a screenshot of the SAP Business Objects query as well. Please, do not hesitate to tell me that I am missing something. I want this to be perfect so others can use this, as I don't believe the other answers have gotten everything right yet.</p>

<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>The query title is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Questions answered by more than 3 50k users</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But that doesn't describe what the query actually does. The query selects questions with three answers given by three <em>distinct</em> top <code>n</code> rated users. They happen to have more than 50k rep on that site, but that's a mere coincidence.</p>
<p>That can also be done by this query, containing only 1 subquery to get the top rated users:</p>
<pre class="lang-sql prettyprint-override"><code>SELECT Q.Id AS [Post Link], Q.AnswerCount
FROM Posts Q
WHERE Q.AnswerCount = 3
AND
(
  SELECT COUNT( DISTINCT A.OwnerUserId)
  FROM Posts A
  WHERE A.ParentId = Q.Id
  AND A.OwnerUserId IN
  (
    SELECT TOP ##TopN## Id
    FROM Users
    ORDER BY Reputation DESC
  )
) = 3
</code></pre>
<p>For the record, the query doing what the title says would be</p>
<pre class="lang-sql prettyprint-override"><code>SELECT Q.Id AS [Post Link], Q.AnswerCount
FROM Posts Q
WHERE Q.AnswerCount &gt;= 3
AND
(
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT A.OwnerUserId)
  FROM Posts A
  JOIN Users U ON A.OwnerUserId = U.Id
  WHERE A.ParentId = Q.Id
  AND U.Reputation &gt;= 50000
) = Q.AnswerCount
</code></pre>
<p>Assuming that the intention was to get questions with answers from 50k users <em>exclusively</em>.</p>

<p>For readability I'd suggest breaking the algorithm up into a number of functions. Any time you find you need to write "heading" comments, it suggests that the code under that heading could go into a separate function. Breaking the code up into functions like this makes the code easier to reason about and, in my experience, easier to test and debug.</p>

<p>Your main() could look like this:</p>

<pre><code>int main () {
  int testCases;
  std::cin &gt;&gt; testCases;
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; testCases; ++i) {
    std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; mainGrid = ReadGrid(std::cin);
    std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; pattern = ReadGrid(std::cin);
    if (IsPatternInGrid(mainGrid, pattern)) {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "YES\n";
    } else {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "NO\n";
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>While the function ReadGrid would be simple enough, the new IsPatternInGrid function would still be quite complex and could possibly also benefit from factoring out some its code into yet another function.</p>

<p>Other things that I changed in the block of code above aren't as important for readability but are common for coding standards:</p>

<ul>
<li>No <code>using namespace std;</code> - use <code>std::</code> where needed.</li>
<li>Prefer <code>'\n'</code> over <code>std::endl</code> except when flushing the output buffer is explicitly needed.</li>
<li>No need for a return 0 as it is the default return value for <code>int main</code>.</li>
</ul>

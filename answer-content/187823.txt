<p>You should copy your page and write the time taken for all <code>file_get_contents()</code> calls and for the query. So you will know why that is very slow.</p>

<p>How many people are using it? How many people are using your server? If too many then it is saturated and very very slow : change your server or the internet connection or optimise your code.</p>

<p>Next, use <code>echo</code> to write text because it s faster than stopping the script and coming back.</p>

<p>It is better to redo a SQL query instead of downloading a file. You could also cache the most used queries eventually in a new database table.</p>

<p>If using the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag you should always inform what is the language.</p>

<p>If you use only a session variable once, it is faster not to save it first in a variable.</p>

<p>If you just need to display a value only don t save it in an array first but at the moment of running the query.</p>

<p>Prefer to use variable instead of array because it is faster.</p>

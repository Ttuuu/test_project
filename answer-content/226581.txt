<h2>Data instead of code</h2>

<p>You have a lot of repeated calls to input. This should really just be a tuple of strings that all refer to a choices dict; something like:</p>

<pre><code>choices = {}

prompts = (
   ('option1': 'Option 1:'), 
   # ...
   ('option1a': 'Good. Now tell me a reason why {option1} is a good choice: '),
   # ...
)

for name, prompt in prompts:
    choices[name] = input(prompt.format(**choices))
</code></pre>

<h2>Global code</h2>

<p>Move most of your global statements into functions, with a top-level <code>main</code> function.</p>

<h2>Quit</h2>

<p>...at the end is redundant.</p>

<h2>The illusion of choice</h2>

<p>Don't ask the user whether they want to flip a coin, only to do it anyway. Either given them an actual choice, or just say that it's going to happen.</p>

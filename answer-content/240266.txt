<li><p>I find it odd that you have declared <code>padString()</code> despite php already offering <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.str-pad.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">str_pad()</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I think I'd favor declaring <code>grade</code>-based rate multipliers as a configurable lookup array rather than a hardcoded condition block.  This way you can maintain that logic without touching the method.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a lot of duplicated method logic in the Department class, this could be D.R.Y.ed out with a single summing method that is fed the correct method name by which to fetch the correct data.</p></li>
<li><p>The same advice applies to your Company class regarding the repeated summing and averaging methods.</p></li>
<li><p>I recommend that all elements in the <code>$input</code> rows be declared with a consistent number of rows.  In other words, you shouldn't need to check if <code>$employeeGroup[3]</code> is set.  This way you can unpack the row values into readable individual values from within the nested <code>foreach()</code> declaration.  <a href="https://3v4l.org/SbgZs" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Demo</a></p>

<pre><code>foreach ($input as $dept =&gt; $staff) {
    foreach ($staff as [$quantity, $type, $grade, $chief]) {
        ...
    }
}
</code></pre></li>

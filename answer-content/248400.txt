<p>Save the transformation to ascii for possible the 256 characters</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ASCII doesn't have 256 characters. It has 128.</p>
<p>And you write with the default encoding, which is UTF-8, so you write the non-ASCII half of your 256 characters as <em>two</em> bytes for no good reason whatsoever, making your file about 1.5 times as large as it should be.</p>
<p>You should really just produce <em>bytes</em>.</p>

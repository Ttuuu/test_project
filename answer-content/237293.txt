<p>The code you posted doesn't seem to be doing what it says. From the way it is called and from the method's name one could tell it is intended to check if the id exists or not. But it doesn't return any answer to this question. instead it inserts some info into a database, which is extremely confusing.</p>

<p>Also this code does some strange things like echoing the word "found" or overwriting the $exist variable with null value. </p>

<p>Therefore, the first and foremost thing you need to do is to make this code <em>consistent</em>. After that it will be possible to review it. </p>

<p>It might help if you explain the problem you are trying to solve first, but I'll have a crack at this.</p>

<p>I don't think this class should have a reason to exist. A key is just that, a key. If you have duplicate keys and duplicate values what you're essentially after is a grouping or a dictionary with a set or list as its value.</p>

<p>What you have is a list of <code>KeyValuePairs</code> which is not the same as a <code>Dictionary</code> :-)</p>

<p>Dictionaries benefit from having unique keys by giving you fast lookups, I'm not sure what benefit you gain by having a <code>DuplicateDictionary</code>.</p>

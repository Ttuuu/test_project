<p>A similar solution using <code>enumerate()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>word, word_list = 'hello', 'hello what is your name i am bob this is a sentence a very n ice sentence'

if word in word_list:
    for position, name in enumerate(word_list):
        if name == word:
            print("Your word is in the list at ", position)
else:
    print('Your word is not in the sentence')
</code></pre>

<p>You could also use a list comprehension:</p>

<pre><code>word, word_list = 'hello', 'hello what is your name i am bob this is a sentence a very n ice sentence'

positions = [x for x, n in enumerate(word_list).split() if n == word]
if positions:
    for position in positions:
        print('your word is in the list at ', position)
else:
    print('Your word is not in the sentence')
</code></pre>

<p>Also, a generator expression that's a little more efficient:</p>

<pre><code>word, word_list = 'hello', 'hello what is your name i am bob this is a sentence a very n ice sentence'

found = False
for position in (x for x, n in enumerate(word_list) if n == word):
    print('your word is in the list at ', position)
    found = True
if not found:
    print('Your word is not in the sentence')
</code></pre>
    </div>

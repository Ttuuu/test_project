<p>Since it's a private method it doesn't matter a whole lot what you do.  You control all of the callers so as long as it works there's not a lot to criticize it for.  Of course with an <code>IEnumerable</code> return value all you can do it iterate, but if that's all you were doing with the <code>IReadOnlyDictionary</code> then it's not a loss of functionality.  There's also the argument for declaring a "minimal" return type to allow easier refactoring.  So if you don't need the functionality of a dictionary, declare it to return the <code>IEnumerable</code>.</p>

<p>You're right that returning a Dictionary of an anonymous type in this instance will be a problem since the function must declare the return type.  But you can just create <code>KeyValuePair</code>s instead, right?</p>

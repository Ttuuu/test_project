<p>One really important and common error this makes is using <code>random</code>.</p>

<p><code>random</code> is sufficient for applications where security isn't needed, but for cases like this, you really should use the <code>secrets</code> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/secrets.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">module</a>. This will generate numbers that are less predictable, at the expense of being slightly slower. Unfortunately, this does make some bits of your program harder, as the module does not provide some of the convenience methods of <code>random</code>, but the methods aren't too hard to write yourself.</p>

<p>For example, <code>symbols_index = random.randrange(len(symbols))</code>becomes <code>secrets.randbelow(len(symbols))</code>.</p>

<h2>Move your code into functions</h2>
<p>Functions are easier to test, and make it easier to modify your code over time.</p>
<p>For example, <em>I think</em> the first block requests information from a server and creates a list of links. <em>I think</em> the second block processes that list of links and generates some other sort of list. <em>I think</em> the third block iterates over the list from the second block and generates yet another list.</p>
<p>If these blocks were in functions, then the main logic would be self explanatory. For example, your code could look like:</p>
<pre><code>...
ilmot = get_students(link)
parsittu = some_other_function(ilmot)
parsilmot = another_function(parsittu)
quote = create_quote(parsilmot)
...
</code></pre>
<p>If those functions all had reasonable names, the code would be very easy to understand, and it would be easy to test each function in isolation.</p>
<p>Not only that, but you can more easily move all of that code into a function so that you can implement a "refresh" feature into the UI so that you don't have to restart the script every time you want to update the data.</p>

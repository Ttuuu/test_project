<h3>Drop the unnecessary time part</h3>

<p>The time part of the date doesn't play a role in the filtering.
You could drop it and the script will be simpler.</p>

<h3>Use more variables</h3>

<p>I find this line a bit difficult to read for multiple reasons:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>'{ $2 = substr($2,8,4)sprintf("%02d",(match("JanFebMarAprMayJunJulAugSepOctNovDec",substr($2,4,3))+2)/3)substr($2,1,2)"T"substr($2,13,8); 
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, I don't see a good reason to overwrite the original value of the field variable <code>$2</code>. It would be natural to store the computed date string in a variable called <code>date</code>.</p>

<p>Secondly, the elements of the formatting logic are hard to read, and it would be easy to fix by assigning them to variables like <code>year</code>, <code>month</code>, <code>day</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, a space between the concatenated elements such as <code>substr(...)sprintf(...)</code> would be really welcome by human readers.</p>

<h3>Use <code>$(...)</code> instead of <code>`...`</code></h3>

<p>There's really no reason to use the archaic and potentially troublesome <code>`...`</code> syntax.</p>

<h3>Order terms in a condition by value</h3>

<p>Instead of this:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>if ($2 &gt;= dstart &amp;&amp; $2 &lt; dend) ...
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Consider this:</p>

<pre><code>if (dstart &lt;= $2 &amp;&amp; $2 &lt; dend) ...
</code></pre>

<p>When the values increase from left to right, the meaning becomes natural, intuitive.</p>

<h3>Don't repeat yourself</h3>

<p>Instead of typing <code>+%Y%m%dT%0H:%0M:%0S</code> twice, it would be better to write it once and store it in a variable.</p>

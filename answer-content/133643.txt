<p>Good question,</p>

<ol>
<li><p>as Joseph mentions, white listing is usually a better approach, and in this case it is also the more readable approach.</p></li>
<li><p>I like your approach better, it avoids re-writing the wheel</p></li>
<li><p>When one passes 4 as a parameter, what will happen? I would throw an Exception if the caller does not pass a <code>String</code>. I would probably pass <code>false</code> if <code>""</code> is provided.</p></li>
<li><p>See point 3. </p></li>
<li><p>I am no big fan of TDD, but I am an outlier ;) Still, the Nixon test case made me chuckle</p></li>
<li><p>You only have to convert to lowercase once:</p>

<pre><code>let cleanString = string.replace(regexReplacer, '').toLowerCase();
return cleanString === reverseString(cleanString);
</code></pre>

<p>I also removed the brackets around the return value, my mind tends to get stuck for a second or two, wondering whether I am missing something or whether the author is just paranoid ;) </p></li>
</ol>

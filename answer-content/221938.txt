<p>That's not a valid package name under the Java convention. Packages are all lowercase with <em>maybe</em> underscores.</p>

<hr>

<pre><code>private static String username = "";
</code></pre>

<p>You don't want these <code>static</code>, actually, you don't want them as fields at all. When dealing with requests, you have to consider that one instance of the same class might handle multiple requests <em>simultaneously</em>. Having a state in the class (f.e. fields) has to be carefully considered.</p>

<hr>

<pre><code>protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {

    String jsp = "";
    queryString = request.getParameter("action");

    if(queryString != null) {

        switch(queryString) {
            case "addStudent":
                jsp = "protected/student.jsp";
        }

        RequestDispatcher rd = request.getRequestDispatcher(jsp);
        rd.forward(request, response);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Consider mapping your requests and actions in a way which allows you to refer to locations directly without having to resort to a big switch statement.</p>

<hr>

<pre><code>private boolean validPassword(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, String password) {

    if(password.length() &gt;= 3) {
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>We all know that's just a placeholder, but you could return directly:</p>

<pre><code>return password.length() &gt;= 3;
</code></pre>

<hr>

<pre><code>RequestDispatcher rd = request.getRequestDispatcher("login-failed.jsp");
rd.forward(request, response);
</code></pre>

<p>You're repeating this action multiple times, consider a helper function. But you could also write that in one line.</p>

<hr>

<pre><code>/**
 * Constructor
 */
</code></pre>

<p>You might as well omit the Javadoc if it's not going to be useful.</p>

<p>You are using a <code>string</code> as the underlying data structure. 
It's wasteful in memory (using 10 possible values out of 256). 
It's also <strong>super-slow</strong>, unless your primary use of <code>BigInt</code> is to print its decimal representation.</p>

<p>You should have chosen something like</p>

<pre><code>class BigInt {
    long number;
    std::vector&lt;unsigned long&gt; extra; // for when number overflows
};
</code></pre>

<p>Discussing the rest kinda doesn't make sense in light of this.</p>

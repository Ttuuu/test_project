<p>There are a lot of ways to accomplish this, one of them is to use recursion. Where in you write a "function" which executes your code &amp; when you hit a certain condition, the function calls itself - </p>

<pre><code>def myf():
    user_in = input('Input an integer value \n')
    if type(user_in) == int:
        a = user_in
        # continue with whatever you need to do with your code
    else: # if user_in is not an int, call your function again, this step keeps repeating unless use enters a valid integer
        print "You have not entered a valid integer, please try again"
        myf()

# call your function
myf()
</code></pre>

<p>Here, you are writing a function named myf(). You ask for an integer value to be entered by a user. You then check if the value entered is indeed an integer, if it is then you enter the "if" condition can continue rest of your code doing whatever you need to. If it is not an integer, you enter the "else" condition where the function calls itself.  </p>

<p>At this point, the cycle repeats itself. </p>

<p>Naming: Don't use abbreviations for already-short words.  <code>Amount</code> instead of <code>Amt</code>, <code>Poker</code> instead of <code>Pkr</code>, <code>Sbmt</code> instead of <code>Submit</code>; you aren't being charged by the character.  Don't use very similar names.  It looks like you have classes <code>PokerPlayer</code> and <code>PkrPlayer</code>, and variables <code>pokerPlayers</code> and <code>pkrPlayers</code>?  If you really can't think of names that differentiate them, are they the same?</p>

<p>Structure:  <code>ProcessQueue</code> implies to me that you are going to iterate over all of your messages and process each one, but that's not what this does. Should <code>ProcessQueue</code> return a value to indicate whether it was able to process any messages?  Your <code>foreach(PkrPlayer pp in pkrPlayers)</code> loop is pretty confusing; the tests against/updating of <code>waitingOn</code> are hard to follow.</p>

<p>I would suggest 2 major changes.  First, just track the next player and have it always be non-null.  Second, store the incoming actions in a <code>Dictionary&lt;PokerPlayer, PokerAction&gt;</code>.  This will make it easy to find the next action or determine that you need to wait for a particular message to come in.  <code>ProcessQueue</code> (or whatever you rename it to) can return a value indicating that it was able to move forward or if it is waiting for a player's action.</p>

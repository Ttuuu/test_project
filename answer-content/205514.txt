<p>The code can be made simpler by using some built-in Laravel validation rules:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Validation of MIME types and extension can already be done in Laravel.</p>

<p>With the rule <code>image</code> as you have for <code>profile_picture</code>, you're already validating if the uploaded file is of the mimetype <code>jpeg</code>, <code>png</code>, <code>bmp</code>, <code>gif</code>, or <code>svg</code> (docs <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/validation#rule-image" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>). If you'd like to specify the mimetype however, you can use the <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/validation#rule-mimes" rel="nofollow noreferrer">mimes rule</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>To validate the max size of the image, you can use the <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/validation#rule-max" rel="nofollow noreferrer">max rule</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>You can also validate the dimensions of the image if needed (docs <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/validation#rule-dimensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>).</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>On the matter of security, I suppose you mean with the uploading of the images. The snippets of code you provided do seem enough (have not perused it), but I would advise using the built-in validation provided by Laravel to provide the best of convenience and security.</p>

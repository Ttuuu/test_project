<p>I'm a little hesitant about this message printed in <code>dieArray()</code>'s loop:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>System.out.println("Sorry, you must enter a positive number.");
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems more fitting to print something like this:</p>

<pre><code>System.out.println("Sorry, you must throw at least one die.");
</code></pre>

<p>This makes it sound (at least to me) less like a mathematical program and more like a game.</p>

<p>In addition, you could consider setting an upper limit to the number of dice that can be thrown, in case the user (strangely) inputs a huge number (which I assume can also break other code).</p>

<p>You could then present the user with a message like this:</p>

<pre><code>System.out.println("Sorry, you cannot throw that many dice.");
</code></pre>

<p>One additional issue is with <code>sizeof(cpy_buf)</code> in <code>cpy</code>.  This will be the size of a pointer (usually 4 or 8 bytes) and not the size of the buffer that <code>cpy_buf</code> points to.  If you follow the advice given in other answers to define <code>cpy_buf</code> within <code>cpy</code>, rathar than pass it in as a parameter, this won't be a problem.</p>

<p>Also a small read/write buffer is inefficient.  You should use at least 512 bytes, and preferably something much larger (like 2048 or 16384 bytes).</p>

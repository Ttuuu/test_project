<p>Firstly good to learn about Scoop, very useful.</p>

<p><del>Secondly, as a big change, which you might not want to do now that
you've already built it:  Consider not using a full browser for this.  I
opened up the website with JavaScript blocked and it worked absolutely
fine, in fact I imagine the HTML will be parseable by just about any
library.  Why make that change?  Well, it will likely reduce your
resource usage by quite a bit and very probably make it much faster, not
to mention being able to do things concurrently, so you'll see results
much quicker.</del>  Edit: I missed the bit where at least one button, "Show more", does run via JavaScript.  Could probably still be worked around by generating the requested URLs programmatically, otherwise Selenium is probably required.</p>

<p>Right, so after that, the pathname handling should probably use
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#module-pathlib" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pathlib</code></a>
to be more robust.</p>

<p>The querying for HTML content I'd rather suggest using
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11465555/can-we-use-xpath-with-beautifulsoup">XPath</a>
or <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#css-selectors" rel="nofollow noreferrer">CSS query syntax</a>
to make things more expressive.  Like
<code>div[class~=hs-shows] div[class~=rls-info-container]</code> etc.  Fewer
function calls, easier to understand if you already know XPath or CSS.
Plus, you can easily
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console/Helpers" rel="nofollow noreferrer">try it in the browser first</a>.</p>

<p>What else?  Well once this gets bigger consider
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>if __name__ == "__main__"</code></a>
and having a <code>main</code> function.</p>

<p>You could also consider some concurrency by immediately passing content
to qBittorrent?  But maybe that was also intentionally done later.</p>

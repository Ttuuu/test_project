<li>The include statements are a weird mix of C++ and C header files. Use <code>&lt;chrono&gt;</code> for time, and use <code>&lt;random&gt;</code> for random functions.</li>
<li><code>using namespace std;</code> is generally frowned upon. See here: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1452721/why-is-using-namespace-std-considered-bad-practice">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1452721/why-is-using-namespace-std-considered-bad-practice</a></li>
<li>Again, use C++ STL random facilities instead of <code>srand</code> and <code>rand</code>. </li>
<li>Don't use <code>goto</code>. You hardly need it nowadays, if ever. See here: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3517726/what-is-wrong-with-using-goto">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3517726/what-is-wrong-with-using-goto</a></li>
<li>Prefer using <code>std::array</code> to C-style arrays. It is just as performant, and allows you to utilize value semantics and STL iterator-based algorithms.</li>
<li>You're creating <code>rpslist</code> in every conditional block. Instead, just create it once at the start, and keep using that.</li>
</ol>

<p>A lot of this code can be avoided using functions. Think about how control 'flows', and structure your program accordingly. You functions judiciously; make sure each function does one task only, and does it well. If a function is getting too big, identify parts which can be separated from it and put them into their own functions.</p>

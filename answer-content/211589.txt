<p>MD-5 is a cryptographic hash-function, it was designed so that it is hard to find an input which produces a particular output.</p>

<p>So it's unlikely you will find an approach better than "brute force".</p>

<p>That said, MD-5 is known to have cryptographic weaknesses, so it's not out of the question to find a faster method.</p>

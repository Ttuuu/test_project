<p>First, while <code>Clumpy</code> is a nice name, it doesn't really say what the class is doing. As a matter of fact, by looking at the code in the class, it tried to solve three different problems, that, in my opinion, shouldn't be grouped in a class. Creating points, plotting and clustering are three very different responsibilities, that's why you usually use three distinct libraries to do it (eg. matplotlib, numpy and sklearn). I think it should be three separate functions in your code, it'll permit much more flexibility.</p>

<p>In the <code>generate_clusters</code> method, I think you could use a little more documentation. I think that the names <code>deviation</code> and <code>max_value</code> are confusing and should be renamed. Since you're creating clusters, I think <code>deviation</code> should be <code>maxDistance</code> or <code>radius</code> or something like that. Regarding <code>max_value</code>, it's not clear that it relates to the maximal distance of the centers, but I have a hard time finding another name right now. Otherwise, I like the creativity used to create the clusters, but I hope you've also tested your clustering code with points that aren't so easily clustered.</p>

<p>Using the <code>__</code> prefix clutters your code a lot. I'd settle for one, personally, or none at all.</p>

<p>You use <strong>wayyyyy</strong> to many comments. A comment should be used when the code isn't clear enough by itself, and only if you didn't find a way (or didn't have time for business reasons) to make it clearer. All the comments by variable names should be deleted and.. I think, all the others too. Your code is pretty clear, the comments are only in the way.</p>

<p>You assign a lot of arrays before using them, that would probably cause problems for large <code>n</code> values, which are pretty common in the field of data analysis. You should consider trying to reduce your memory footprint by using large arrays only when you need them instead of assigning them at first.</p>

<p>I've said it in the review, but the main thing that needs work is to separate the logic in functions. There're no good reasons to have the file reading, the plotting and the clustering in an object! I'm sure once you've done the work to split the code you'll find it much clearer.</p>

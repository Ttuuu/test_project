<p>In addition to <em>Linny</em>'s answer, one can also optimize the bubble sort algorithm like this:</p>

<pre><code>def bubble_sort(nums):  # sorry that I am too lazy to include type hints here :)
    for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
        found = False
        for j in range(len(nums) - 1 - i):  # start == 0 and step == 1 are unnecessary
            if nums[j] &gt; nums[j + 1]:
                nums[j], nums[j + 1] = nums[j + 1], nums[j]
                found = True  # it means that there is at least a swap
        if not found:  # if there is no swap it means that there is no need to go for next value of i
            break

    return nums
</code></pre>

<p>Hope it helps.</p>

<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>It might be good to think through what this line is doing...</p>

<pre><code>choices = list(product(range(1, faces+1), repeat=dice))
</code></pre>

<p>The help for <code>product()</code> says that with your value of <code>dice</code>, this is the same as </p>

<pre><code>product(range(1, faces+1),
        range(1, faces+1),
        range(1, faces+1),
        range(1, faces+1),
        range(1, faces+1),
        range(1, faces+1),
        range(1, faces+1),
        range(1, faces+1),
        range(1, faces+1),
        range(1, faces+1))
</code></pre>

<p>So when you run this, <code>choices</code> will eventually be of size 10^11. I suspect if you try to run this, and watch your system RAM usage, you will be very sad about the size of your list.</p>

<p>I would suggest either finding a different solution to your problem, or just don't use so many dice ;)</p>

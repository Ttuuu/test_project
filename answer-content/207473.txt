<p>The main problem is that you're attempting to create about 9000 canvas objects a second. While the canvas is fairly flexible and powerful, it starts to have performance issues once you create a few tens of thousands of objects, even when you delete them later. Since you are creating 9000 objects per second, you're going to hit that limit very quickly. </p>

<p>You also have the problem that you continually append to <code>self.rectangulars</code> but you never remove anything from that array. So, every second that array grows by 9000 elements. Since you attempt to iterate over that entire list every 100ms, the program will continue to get slower and slower.</p>

<p>The solution is to re-use the canvas items rather than recreate them. The <code>create_rectangle</code> method returns an identifier that you can use forever. For example, to
reset the entire grid you could do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>for item in self.rectangulars:
    self.canvas.itemconfigure(item, background=gray)
</code></pre>
    </div>

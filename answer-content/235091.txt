<p>Before handing the company any code you wrote, you should ask for clarification of the task.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Write a JAVA program that will:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The correct spelling is Java, not JAVA.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Generate a file with random numeric (range from 1 to 2^64 âˆ’ 1 integers) data.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>The grammar is slightly wrong here. They should have written "with random integers in the range from 1 to 2^64 - 1". I don't think you are supposed to squeeze 2^64 integers into a file that is only 64 MB in size.</p>

<p>Are duplicate numbers allowed? What is the purpose of these random numbers, after all?</p>

<p>Should the random numbers follow a certain distribution?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Filesize is limited by command line options.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What does this mean? In another part of the task they say "Program will require 1 argument", which contradicts this sentence.</p>

<p>Also, how is the file size specified? It could be <code>-max 64MB</code> or <code>-max-file-size=64m</code> or <code>--maximal-file-size 32M</code> or <code>max=16000k</code>. Also, when they say <code>MB</code>, do they mean <code>1_000_000</code> or rather <code>1_048_576</code>?</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol start="2">
  <li>Read the file generated in step #1, analyze it and output it to the console.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>This could mean you are supposed to write the whole 64 MB to the output in a single line. Is that really what they want, and if so, why?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The output should include:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does the word "include" here mean you are allowed to output arbitrary other things?</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>10 most frequently appeared numbers in bar chart form.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>How wide should the bar chart be? Should that be configurable by command line arguments?</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol start="2">
  <li>The count of Prime numbers.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Is it sufficient if the program outputs the count of <em>probable primes</em> (like your code currently does)?</p>

<p>Should the program output some example prime numbers, in addition to the count? This would allow a human reader to crosscheck whether the program works reliably.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol start="4">
  <li>Output separately the time taken to read and analyze the file.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Wall time or CPU time?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Program speed matters</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's too imprecise. What run time is acceptable for the program? Is 5 minutes ok, or does it have to be less than 10 seconds? How many CPUs are available for parallel processing?</p>

<p>All these questions are typical for your future everyday job. Often the people who give you tasks like these don't know exactly what they <em>really</em> want. By asking these questions in a polite and calm way, you make them think again about their requirements and whether they make sense at all.</p>

<hr>

<p>Regarding your code: You should install IntelliJ and load your code there. IntelliJ will produce many warnings and hints how you can improve your code. In many situations IntelliJ can also fix the code for you. Just place the text cursor on a warning and press Alt+Enter to see whether there is a fix or a refactoring for that warning.</p>

<p>For example, starting with Java 8 it is no longer usual to write the verbose <code>implements Callable&lt;X&gt;</code>. Instead, unnamed functions are used. These are also called lambda functions.</p>

<p>Your error handling is broken. If nothing else is said, when an error occurs while writing the file with the random numbers, it does not make sense to continue at all. Therefore it is wrong to just write an error message to <code>System.out</code>. Just let the <code>IOException</code> bubble up until some code really knows what to do with this exception. In your case you don't know at all, therefore no part of your code should catch this exception.</p>

<p>In <code>MathUtils</code> there should be a method <code>isPrime</code>. Your current code is inconsistent since <code>isArmstrongNumber</code> is implemented there but <code>isPrime</code> isn't.</p>

<p>You should add some unit tests to your code, just to prove that you tested the basic cases.</p>

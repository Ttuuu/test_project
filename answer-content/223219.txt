<p>Folks, I appreciated who looked into this. After spending about 6 hours, I was able to resolve the issue by rewriting above section. Result: overall <code>under 2 minutes</code> processing, instead of previously reported <code>2 hour +</code> processing time (for <code>52k X 105 to 52k X 105 matrix (list of lists) for element vs element comparison</code>). May not still be perfect but I think this serves the purpose at this time and somebody may find this version helpful:  </p>

<p>r = prx (for better look only)<br>
c = ux  (for better look only)  </p>

<pre><code># Outer loop to iterate thru rows (sublists)
for r in rng_lenAp:
    # Inner loop to iterate thru columns (elements of a sublist)
    for c in rng_ls:
        # retain 1st sublist, which contains IDs
        if r == 0:
            output[r].append(str(Ap[r][c]) + '^' + str(Bu[l_urx[r]][l_ux[c]]))
        else:
            # retain 1st elements in each row: they uniquely id rows
            if c == 0:
                output[r].append(str(Ap[r][c]) + '^' + str(Bu[l_urx[r]][l_ux[c]]))
            else:
                if Ap[r][c]== Bu[l_urx[r]][l_ux[c]]:
                    output[r].append ('ok^ok')
                else:
                    output[r].append(str(Ap[r][c]) + '^' + str(Bu[l_urx[r]][l_ux[c]]))

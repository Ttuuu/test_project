<p>Other answers have most of this covered.  But I'd like to add one observation:</p>

<h1>Don't print error messages to <code>std::cout</code></h1>

<p>The standard output stream is for program output.  Use <code>std::cerr</code> for error messages; in many cases, the user may be sending standard output to a pipeline or a file, but leave standard error writing to their terminal.  In any case, that's the one to watch for error messages.</p>

<p>For a general-purpose utility class like this, you really should consider whether writing a message is the appropriate choice.  I recommend you consider throwing exceptions for list underrun or use of other lists' iterators.  The calling application can choose whether and how to handle the exception (as it must for <code>std::bad_alloc</code> already).</p>

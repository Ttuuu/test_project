<p>First: welcome to CodeReview! I hope that you get good feedback.</p>

<p>About your code. Your usage of Python is not terrible; most of your problems are conceptual, about the decisions you've made about your class. Looking at the method signatures from the outside, one would guess that <code>addRate()</code> can be called multiple times per single <code>Bank</code> instance, and that <code>convert</code> would then allow for any currency to be converted. That isn't the case; instead, your "Bank" class is actually closer to an "ExchangeRate" class.</p>

<p>There are two ways to go, here. Either make your class an ExchangeRate, in which case</p>

<ul>
<li>you need to rename the class</li>
<li><code>convert</code>, rather than accepting the name of a currency, should perhaps accept a <code>forward</code> boolean. Or, if you want to keep passing the name of a currency, it's important to make the argument name more clear, i.e. <code>dest_currency</code>.</li>
<li>Rename your addCommission to setCommission. "add" implies having more than one.</li>
<li>Rename your addRate to setRate. "add" implies having more than one.</li>
</ul>

<p>Or, keep a "Bank" class, in which case:</p>

<ul>
<li>you need to change the way that you store your exchange rates, probably to a dictionary-based system instead of a single float member</li>
<li>convert would accept both a source and destination currency</li>
<li>addRate's signature would stay the same, but its contents would change to use your dict.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>frontInd</code> is never declared.  It's only ever assigned to, so that assignment can just be removed.</p>

<p>Avoid <code>using namespace std</code> - that's not a namespace that's designed to be imported wholesale, and you could introduce surprising bugs that way.  Given that we have a single use of <code>std::cout</code> and nothing else from the standard library, it's actually costing more code lines/characters (as well as more cognitive overhead) than just writing the prefix where needed.</p>

<p>Inseparable data should be contained in a class.  Here, <code>backInd</code> and <code>Queue</code> belong together; no outside code ever needs to use <code>backInd</code>, so it could be a private member.  That said, <code>backInd</code> is always equal to <code>x</code> when writing, so we could just index that way.</p>

<p>Consider an alternative algorithm - the current approach will be slow when the number of operations gets large.  Consider looping over the operations just once, recording the delta of value at each position (so each operation will update just two values - an increment at the beginning of its range and a corresponding decrement at the end).  Then track the cumulative total when writing the output.</p>

<ul>
<li>You preform multiple function calls which are all very related. You can cram each of the regex checks into one if statement.</li>
<li>You should use a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/419163/what-does-if-name-main-do">main guard</a> to ensure that the code is only running if this file is the main one, so that any programs importing this file don't have any issues.</li>
<li>You should also use <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-docstrings/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docstrings</a>. These allow potential documentation to display information about what the methods(s) are supposed to accomplish.</li>
<li>Using condensed if statements can clean up the messiness of having <code>if: ... else: ...</code> when there is just one statement being executed in each block.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is the updated code:</p>

<pre><code>#! /usr/bin/python3

import re

def check(password):
    """ 
    Ensures password has at least one uppercase, one lowercase, and one digit
    """
    return False if not re.search('[A-Z]', password) or not re.search('[a-z]', password) or not re.search('[0-9]', password) else True

if __name__ == '__main__':
    password = input("Enter password: ")
    print("Strong password") if check(password) else print("Weak Password")
</code></pre>

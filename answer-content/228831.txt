<p>Don't store method flow flags as state in classes. This is a breach in object-oriented design.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>class Node
{
    public boolean visited;
    // .. other
}
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Search methods like <code>dfs</code> should use a map of some sort to store which nodes are visited.</p>

<p>By storing this flag incorrectly as state, you'll get in trouble when multiple threads search the graph concurrently.</p>

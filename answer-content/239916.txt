<p>I am not familiar with Android so I don't know how you get albumMap into the click event. Can you get selected Album (album object) into the event?</p>

<p>If not.. </p>

<p>I assume albumMap is a map between position to Album. </p>

<p>If so I suggest the name postion2album. if not please update your post and clarify what this map is. </p>

<p>So all you need to do is albumMap[position].getAlbum()</p>

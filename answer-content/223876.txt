<li>Instead of throwing away that list of <code>GovernmentCsvRecord</code> objects after converting it to a <code>StringCsv</code> list, you could keep it around so you don't have to read the csv file again if the <code>IsNumericFile</code> check fails.</li>
<li>It looks like you can validate the list of <code>GovernmentCsvRecord</code> objects directly instead of first converting them to <code>StringCsv</code> objects. However, with the way you're converting them, and taking the numeric check into account, it's probably better to read each row into an array of strings. Apparently the easiest way to do that is to give <code>GovernmentCsvRecord</code> a single <code>string[]</code> property. That lets you validate fields without having to use reflection.</li>
<li>That regular expression can be simplified a lot. The first part matches strings like <code>"a12345"</code> - anything that starts with an a, b, c or d, followed by exactly 5 digits. The second part matches anything that contains at least one digit - which covers everything that the first part covers, and more, so just the second part is sufficient. Also note that <code>\d</code> matches decimal digits from a variety of scripts, including <code>0-9</code>, so <code>[\d0-9]</code> can be simplified to just <code>\d</code>. But you may want to use <code>0-9</code> instead, unless you also want to accept digits like <code>'р│м'</code> and <code>'рем'</code>.</li>

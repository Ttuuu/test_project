<p>You don't need to compare any two elements.  Just compare the array values (the sticker) with the index of the array.  Keep in mind that the sticker is one-based and the index is zero-based.</p>

<pre><code>minimumBribes = q =&gt; {
    const bribes = q.reduce( (bribes, assigned, actual, too_chaotic) =&gt; { 
        const distance = assigned - 1 - actual
        if (distance&gt;2) too_chaotic=true
        else return bribes + distance*(distance&gt;0)
    }, 0);
    return isNaN(bribes) ? "Too chaotic" : bribes;
}
</code></pre>

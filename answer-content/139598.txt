<p>Honestly, I'm not sure how much simpler you can make this.</p>

<p>I'd suggest a slightly clearer name though - maybe <code>ensureTrailingSlash</code>? <code>checkX</code> sounds more like a predicate. My other suggestion would be to add some spaces in your if-conditional, depending on your taste:</p>

<pre><code>if (!website.endsWith("/")) {
</code></pre>

<p>This could be a static method, as well.</p>
    </div>

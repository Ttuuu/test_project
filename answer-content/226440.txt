<p>Your <code>compare</code> function can be simplified a bit using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/sign" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Math.sign</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>let compare = (a, b)  =&gt; {
  return -Math.sign(a.val - b.val);
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>sign</code> will return one of -1, 0, or 1, which correspond to the sign of the number passed to it. This is basically what you were doing manually. Most languages have a <code>sign</code> (or <code>signum</code>) function for cases like this.</p>

<p>I also used a unary prefix <code>-</code> to negate instead of using <code>* -1</code>. As an alternative, you could change it to just:</p>

<pre><code>let compare = (a, b)  =&gt; {
  return Math.sign(b.val - a.val);  // a and b were swapped
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which will have the same effect. It depends on what looks more readable to you.</p>

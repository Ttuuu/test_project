<h1><code>Deck.reset</code> bug</h1>
<p>This function has no access to <code>num_decks</code>, so if you decide to call this function it will fail with a syntax error. A simple fix would be to define this as an instance variable in the constructor, i.e <code>self.num_decks</code>, and use that.</p>
<h1><code>validate_answer</code></h1>
<p>This function should be written like this:</p>
<pre><code>from typing import List

def validate_answer(question: str, choices: List[str]) -&gt; bool:
    while answer := input(question)[0].lower():
        if answer in choices:
            return answer == choices[0]
</code></pre>
<p>This makes use of the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0572/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">walrus operator</a>, aka assignment expressions. This also fixes a bug. If a user enters "N" instead of "n", this function rejects that input and asks again. It's better to lower the input and analyze it that way.</p>

<h1>Misc whitespace</h1>
<p>You have many places like</p>
<pre><code>yes_no =   ['y', 'n']
</code></pre>
<p>where there's extra whitespace. Try to keep one space before and after operators to make it readable without being extraneous.</p>

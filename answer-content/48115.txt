<p><a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/31503/rolfl">@rolfl</a> totally nailed it. Only a few nitpicks left behind:</p>

<ul>
<li>I'd drop all pointless comments, unless they serve a purpose when you teach this</li>
<li>Add the <code>@Override</code> annotations for clarity when reading not in an IDE</li>
<li>Whenever you can drop <code>this.</code> from <code>this.cursor</code>, I'd drop it</li>
<li>The way you use spacing around brackets does not follow well the standard. Use the reformat function of your IDE (equivalent of <code>Control-Shift-f</code> in Eclipse)</li>
</ul>

<p>I think it's a great idea asking here before presenting to your class!</p>

<p>The code you have written for player two is just the same for player one as they both perform the same end result(log in a player). So instead I would recommend you create a function in which logs in a player and then just use that function twice instead of having to type out the whole code twice. This makes it much simpler and easier.</p>

<p>Also as a side note you could store the users in a dictionary:</p>

<pre><code>users = {
    'Joe': 'juk725',
    'Mat': 'axr3',
    'Th3_j0k3r': 'bl4z3',
    'ag4r-j3lly': 'Micr0b3'
}
</code></pre>

<p>--&gt; and then create a pickle file(on a separate program) where these users are stored:</p>

<pre><code>import pickle

users = {
    'Joe': 'juk725',
    'Mat': 'axr3',
    'Th3_j0k3r': 'bl4z3',
    'ag4r-j3lly': 'Micr0b3'
}

with open('users.pickle', 'wb') as afile:
    # Pickle the 'data' dictionary using the highest protocol available.
    pickle.dump(users, f, pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)
</code></pre>

<p>--&gt; then create a definition of users in you login system:</p>

<pre><code>with open('users.pickle', 'rb') as a_file:
    users = pickle.load(a_file)
</code></pre>

<p>This addition will allow you to give new users access to signup / register as well as providing an easy way to store users.</p>

<p>[ ocr gcse comp science right ;) ]</p>

<pre><code>login_or_signup = input('do you want to login or signup? ')

# sign up (creating new account)
if login_or_signup.lower() == "signup":

    create_username = input("enter a new username: ")
    create_password = input("enter a new password (Your password cannot be the same as your username !!!!!!!): ")

    if create_password in users:
        create_password = input("password taken re-enter: ")

    users[create_username] = create_password
</code></pre>
    </div>

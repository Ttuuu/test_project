<p>Interesting stuff. Some high-level comments:</p>

<ul>
<li>calling <code>exit()</code> when something goes wrong is fine for one-off code of your own but not very polite if you're making a library for others to use. Raise a well-named exception with a meaningful error message instead. As it is, since you're instantiating <code>QRandom</code> at the module level, if someone even imports your module and they don't have qvm/quilc installed (or if they're on a mac, which has neither <code>gnome-terminal</code> nor <code>terminal</code>!) their code will silently exit. </li>
<li>exporting <code>getstate</code> and <code>setstate</code> from <code>random.Random</code> seems a bit misleading here, since they won't work as expected. I would override them to raise <code>NotImplementedError</code> unless you have a way of implementing them - and the same for <code>seed</code> and <code>jumpahead</code>, in fact.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have a few more minor detail comments about the code but I'll have to add those later - if you're interested, anyway.</p>

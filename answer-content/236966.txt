<p>Personally I would define it in each package that uses it. It would only be a small amount of duplication but has many advantages:</p>

<ol>
<li>It keeps the package self contained.</li>
<li>You mentioned that not all packages use the same method so it stops the interface getting very large.</li>
<li>If not every package uses each method it makes it explicit which method a package does use.</li>
</ol>

<p><code>writeVoxelAsSTL</code> takes <code>unsigned</code> arguments, but it seems like the native type is actually a long. Could it take longs instead? For example, <code>unsigned(2^31)</code> looks like it would not be a valid value since it would overflow into -1 upon conversion.</p>

<hr>

<p>You could take an <code>ostream&amp;</code> argument instead so the code isn't coupled to files. </p>

<hr>

<p>You could factor out the bools and directions into arrays, and rewrite much of the code into loops.</p>

<p>Further improvement would depend on how this is being used. How is the grid represented? Can you combine neighboring voxel faces? For example, would a 100x1x1 stack require 804 triangles, or 12? Perhaps you could split this into multiple phases, one that extracts relevant planes, and one that writes planes to a stream.  Maybe even one that first extracts a sparse list of relevant voxels depending on how you're visiting them.</p>

<p>If this needs to be performant, surface extraction from voxels is a very parallelizable algorithm. Consider just a 2x2x2 box: 38 out of 64 points computed are going to be shared. The center point will be computed 8 times but never used. </p>

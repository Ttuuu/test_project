<p>Your code looks to be about the expected level of complexity for the task.  I wouldn't attempt to reduce it any further - you're unlikely to make it faster, and definitely likely to hinder its clarity.</p>

<p>The nested loop structure accurately reflects the data's structure, and I think there's a lot of value in keeping the two aligned.</p>

<p>The thing I might actually question is the <em>interface</em> exposed by this class.  It would be very useful to present a <code>QSettings</code> facade to your configuration file to make it easier to interface with other code.  You're not far from being able to do that, but <code>QSettings::registerFormat()</code> wants its reader to have this signature:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>bool myReadFunc(QIODevice &amp;device, QSettings::SettingsMap &amp;map);
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>input</code> parameter can just as easily be a <code>QIODevice&amp;</code> as a <code>QFile&amp;</code>, given that we only create a reader from it, and it wouldn't be hard to use a <code>QSettings::SettingsMap</code> (which is just an alias of <code>QMap&lt;QString,QVariant&gt;</code>) in place of <code>output</code>.</p>

<p>I have a few recommendations to give you.</p>

<p>Firstly, you should try to use flat layouts when you are using a lot of view components. Try changing your <code>TableLayout</code> to a <code>ConstraintLayout</code> which is flat and has been proven to be generally a quicker solution. You can even use included <code>ConstraintLayout</code> layouts as you are within your parent, although that is a bit unnecessary as all layouts are just translated back into one. </p>

<p>Secondly, I want to ask if there's a reason for you to create the views dynamically. If you are after animations, you could easily and beautifully do it with some Libraries both from the OS as third-party. Inflating so many views almost at the same time is bound to freeze up your UI and make the user wait, which is definitely not desired. You can create a single 9-box layout and include it multiple times through xml inside your parent layout and avoid inflating all the views at run-time.</p>

<p>Lastly, If you absolutely must inflate programmatically, try doing it as one <code>ConstraintLayout</code> 9 times adding the 9 layouts within a parent <code>ConstraintLayout</code> and <strong>not</strong> a <code>TableLayout</code> (generally this is an outdated ViewGroup which has stopped being used because of its terrible loading time). To reduce even more the loading time you could look into loading in a background thread while you show a smart animation or progress bar in the main thread. </p>

<p>I hope this helped, Panos.</p>

<p>I'll just go from top to bottom, not in the order of importance:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>size_t get_body_length() const;</code> does not make much sense. Also not clear what it does. If it is the length of body, why not just body().size()? If this is Content-Length, why is it called body length and what's wrong with getting it from the headers?</li>
<li><code>void body(const std::string&amp; data)</code> name is inconsistent with other set_* functions. In general, prefer verb-named functions</li>
<li>In <code>get_header_value</code> prefer <code>optional</code> to returning a special value like an empty string</li>
<li>The ability to iterate a http_message as a list of headers is counter-intuitive to say the least.</li>
<li>You might want to consider adding named constants for response codes and HTTP verbs</li>
<li><code>http_message::add_header</code> treats Content-length as case-insensitive, while other headers as case-sensitive, which violates HTTP standard and is counter-intuitive to anyone not familiar with the internal implementation of your class</li>
<li><code>case_insensitive_match</code>, though probably unneeded, I'd still like to point out that it can be simplified in several ways. One of them is using std::equal/std::mismatch with a predicate which would give you a no-copy solution</li>
<li>Probably most important is that I don't see a use-case for this class as it is because it lacks a lot of features like serializing/deserializing to wire format.</li>
</ol>

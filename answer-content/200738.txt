<p>First of all, it violates the "tell don't ask" principle: if your OptionInstallItem is not inherently coupled to the database and its actions (and as you do not even record the reference to the refmanager, it obviously isn't) it should not go about scavenging in your whole application to get its job done. Always give every class exactly what it needs to operate, not the "master key" for self service.</p>

<p>Then, your way makes it unnecessarily hard to test. If you have a simple object along the lines of</p>

<pre><code>public MyClass(String myLabel) {
    this.myLabel = myLabel;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Testing is as simple as can be:</p>

<pre><code>MyClass testObject = new MyClass("test");
Assert....
</code></pre>

<p>On the other hand, if you have</p>

<pre><code>public MyClass(DatabaseInterfaceThingy database) {
    this.myLabel = database.doSomeQueryForMyLabel("me");
}
</code></pre>

<p>... say hello to mockito to even <em>instantiate</em> that object.</p>

<p>And send your colleagues over to Codereview to learn a few things and be able to tell you "why" the next time ... ;-)</p>

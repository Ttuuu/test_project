<p>The "not happy interviewer" case is probably not connected to the efficiency of the algorithm, but to a few problems with the codes cleanliness:</p>

<ul>
<li>You modify method parameters. While this is technically possible, it is generally frowned upon as it makes code hard to read and even harder to debug. Don't do this. Period.</li>
<li>Variable names don't match. <code>root</code> becomes a general pointer to a tree node (which is not root any more), <code>right</code> becomes left. This is a mumble jumble of hard to understand code, which is a nightmare to maintain.</li>
<li>The way you find the target element is not obvious at a glance. At least add a comment on what you do and why it solves the original problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>From the interviewers perspective, you managed to solve a simple problem with a piece of code, which already is problematic to understand and maintain. Imagine what happens if you get a real complex task with 100 classes and 10000 lines of code involved...</p>

<p>Thus: work on maintainability and clarity first.</p>

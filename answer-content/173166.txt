<p>Some optimizations scenarios just from looking at the code:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't pass <code>std::string encoded_string</code> by value as you're making a useless copy. As you're only interested in an array of bytes, passing a <code>string_view</code> (or the traditional pointer + size) is more flexible.</li>
<li>You know how big the resulting vectors will be, so using <code>operator[]</code> after increasing their size might be faster than constantly calling <code>push_back()</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>For more opportunities for optimizations, profile the code to find bottlenecks.</p>

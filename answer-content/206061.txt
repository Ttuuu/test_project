<p>There are a couple of ways I would approach this.</p>

<p>Personally I think that someone passing an array is a coding error and I would just raise an exception in that case instead of complicating the interface.</p>

<p>If you do want to keep it as a return result then I would try and keep the return type consistent. i.e. I would return something like <code>{success: true, character:'1'}</code> in the case of success and something like <code>{ success: false, error: "array not accepted" }</code> in the case of failure. This makes it easy for the caller to test the result (testing the result type is a bad practice IMO).</p>

<p>If you are concerned about bad input then I would test for any type of bad input. This could be as simple as <code>if (character &amp;&amp; character.charCodeAt) { ...</code></p>

<p>Lastly you should provide a return value for all possible paths. In your case you don't return anything if the character is not between 'a' and 'z'.</p>

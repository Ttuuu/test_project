<p><strong>Check your if expression in review part:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>if (note &lt;= 4 || note &gt;= 1) {
    System.out.println("Thanks for your review.");
}else {
    System.out.println("That's better, we'll do our best the next time");
}
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This will always print "Thanks for your review" since whatever the value of note will be always true either for <code>&lt;= 4</code> or <code>&gt;= 1</code>.</p>

<p>Using an IDE (for example IntelliJ, netbeans, eclipse) helps you mitigate this kind of problems, but it's still better to always review your code.</p>

<p><strong>Confusing result and advise:</strong></p>

<p><em>I'm not sure if the application is happy that I drank enough water or sad because I only drank 1 bottle</em>. </p>

<p>As stated in your question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The objective is to calculate the amount of water one has drunk in a
  day. Depending on the user's input, the app tells him or her if the
  amount of water drunk is great or not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then I think you don't need to tell them how many bottles they drink or at least remove the sad face to avoid confusion.</p>

<p><strong>User input problems:</strong></p>

<p>Case 1: What if the user input a letter instead of number? This will happen:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/q6bWV.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/q6bWV.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>Case 2: What if the user input a negative number? Then this will happen:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xLaM9.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xLaM9.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>As you can see in case 1, this will break your program. Although in case 2 the program will not crash, I think it's impossible to drink negative amount of water.</p>

<p><em>To solve this kind of issue, you can use try/catch expression</em>. Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>double litre = 0;
boolean isInvalidInput = false;
do {
    try {
        System.out.print("Amount of water your bottle can hold: ");
        // entering amount of water bottle can hold
        litre = sc.nextDouble();
        isInvalidInput = false;
    } catch (InputMismatchException e) {
        isInvalidInput = true;
    }
    sc.nextLine();
} while(isInvalidInput || litre &lt; 0);
</code></pre>

<p>If you use the code above, this will be the output:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3g4AF.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3g4AF.png" alt="tryCatch"></a></p>

<p>As you can see, the program will ask the same question repeatedly until the user enters a correct input</p>

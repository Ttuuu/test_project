<p>What especially jumps at me is, that you take your real data object (the Employee), convert it to a <em>string representation</em> and do your checks on the string.</p>

<p>Why? Can't you check your data object?</p>

<p>Apart from that, I don't see a problem with 5 and-conditions. This is clearer to read than some clever stream-through-predicates-and-reduce code. Clear. Simple. Leave it like that.</p>

<p>What I'd recommend is rethinking your naming:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>getPredicate()</code>: yes, it returns a predicate, we see that from the method signature. But <em>what</em> does this predicate test?</li>
<li><code>filter()</code>: does some filtering, but according <em>to which criteria</em>?</li>
</ul>

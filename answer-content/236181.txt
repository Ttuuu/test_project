<pre><code>if correct_answer == 'True':
    self.correct_answer = ['yes', 'y', 'f', 'true']
elif correct_answer == 'False':
    self.correct_answer = ['no', 'n', 'f', 'false']

<p><code>f</code> is recognized as a correct answer for both True and False answers, so I can collect all the points without knowing the correct answer to any of the questions by consistently answering <code>f</code>.</p>

<p>This behavior is a bit counter-intuitive, so it makes sense to explicitly document it in the code</p>

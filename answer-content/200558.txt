<p>One obvious improvement is to clean up your tests. You could just test</p>

<pre><code>results = merge([1, 4, 7], [2, 3, 6, 9])
return results == [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9]
</code></pre>

<p>Technically this also tests that <code>results</code> is a list, which is arguably an implementation detail, but since that is the obvious choice, it seems fine. (and much terser)</p>

<p>Other than that, this code looks pretty good.</p>

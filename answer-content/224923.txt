<p>This isn't the <em>really</em> basic linked list. For the <em>most</em> basic way of doing linked lists, you would get rid of <code>class linkedlist</code> entirely, and have <code>class Node</code> be the entire implementation. You need both getters and setters for both <code>item</code> and <code>next</code>, and those four plus the constructor are really the only primitive operations there are. Every other list operation is an algorithm built on those 5 primitives.</p>

<p>It sounds like what you're trying to do is an exercise in stripping the idea of linked lists down to its essence. To do that, you need to wrap your head around the fact that there's no difference between having "a list" and having "the node at the head of a list"; each node <em>is</em> a list; and a list is nothing but the nodes and items that make it up.</p>

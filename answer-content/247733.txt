<p>This is not a review, but an extended comment.</p>
<p>The linear time/constant space solution is too well known to be spelled out again. However, here it goes.</p>
<p><code>XOR</code> of two equal numbers is 0, and <code>XOR</code> of a number and 0 leaves the number unchanged. <code>XOR</code> is commutative and associative operation; we may perform it in any order we wish, and arrive to the same result. In other words, if we <code>XOR</code> all of them, each pair of numbers would cancel to 0, and the final result would be the number without a pair, the one we are looking for.</p>

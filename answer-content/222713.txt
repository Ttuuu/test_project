<p>I was interested in this as it's a cool idea. However the demeanor in your question and code makes me not want to review this.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your frickin python version is so very WROOOOOOOONG</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's really mature.</p>

<hr>

<p><code>get_dir_contents</code> is just a verbose version of <code>os.walk</code>. What's worse is <code>root</code> is unused and bizarre. If you change <code>only_these_extensions</code> to start with a dot then you can also further simplify your code.</p>

<pre><code>import os
import pathlib
from typing import Set, Iterator

only_these_extensions = {'.jpg', '.png', '.gif', '.jpeg', '.bmp', '.tif', '.tiff', '.webp'}


def get_dir_contents(path: str,
                     extensions: Set[str],
                     followlinks: bool = True,
                     ) -&gt; Iterator[pathlib.Path]:
    for dir_path, _, file_names in os.walk(path, followlinks=followlinks):
        dir_path = pathlib.Path(dir_path)
        for file_name in file_names:
            full_path = dir_path / file_name
            if full_path.suffix in extensions:
                yield full_path
</code></pre>

<p>After this I started looking at the rest of your code and I didn't get far until I saw <code>build_tables</code> which looks to have a massive bug. <code>node_table[inode] = file</code> should probably be <code>node_table[inode].append(file)</code>. And unhelpful classes called <code>file_thing</code>.</p>

<p>Change your code to use <code>pathlib</code>, <code>os.path</code> and <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>mypy</code></a>, remove all your useless <code>print</code>s and remove your "I'm better than you" demeanor and I'd give you a better followup review.</p>

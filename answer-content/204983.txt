<p>Well, firstly your code doesn't "run" as you have no entry point (ala <code>if __name__</code>...), secondly, you have no test code to even prove your code works as you believe it to, and thirdly - you have a function <code>makeIntArray</code> which is not used in your code.</p>

<p>Regarding your points - readability - your function names need improving. <code>compareToComplete</code> means what? Compare to...? What is Complete? You're passing in a partial variable but how do you validate against the complete variable? It's not in the function signature.<br>
Also, you're using CamelCase and not snake_case. Check out the PEP8 conventions and adhere to them as best you can when writing Python.</p>

<p>The docstring of <code>compareToComplete</code> explains the function very well, but if a programmer has to read the docstring to understand your code, then your code has failed to tell the story of what it does. Write your code without a docstring, and add the docstring when you need to explain WHY you have it.  </p>

<p>Docstrings that say "I print out a variable" and the code is named <code>print_variable(variable)</code> make the docstring redundant and should be deleted. As a famous programmer said "comments lie, but the code tells the truth". </p>

<p>The other point - improving your code - I echo what is mentioned above, write your code to explain what it does, naming your variables appropriately. </p>

<p>Other than that, keep writing code. The more you write, and the more you read, the better you get. Also, hang out on code review and try your hand at giving answers too, read what others say on other questions to learn and improve. </p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

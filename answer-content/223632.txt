<p><code>getHeight</code> and <code>getWidth</code> should be const.</p>

<pre><code>int getWidth() const { return width; }
int getHeight() const { return height; }
</code></pre>

<p>Your destructor does not properly delete the <code>pixels</code> pointer.  Since you allocate it with <code>new[]</code> you need to use <code>delete[]</code>.</p>

<pre><code>delete [] pixels;
</code></pre>

<p>You're storing your textures in column-major order.  Depending on how you access them, this can cause performance issues with caching.  For example, in the constructor, when you copy in the initial texture values you jump thru memory (one byte every <code>width</code> bytes) rather than reading it sequentially (where <code>x</code> would be the inner loop).</p>

<p>Then there's the inevitable question of why you're using manual memory management, rather than using <code>vector</code>.</p>

<p>If you don't need the <code>confirmExit</code> function anywhere else, you can just assign it to to <code>window.beforeunload</code>.</p>

<pre><code>window.onbeforeunload = function() {
    if (formmodified == 1) {
        return "Are you sure you want to leave this page? This will abandon any progress on changes to document preferences";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure your indentation is consistent, it's confusing to read when brackets don't match up.</p>

<p>Last but not least, it might be helpful (saves you the trouble of writing the same thing multiple times) and more performant to use a class for elements that should have a click handler to reset the "modified" state of the form:</p>

<pre><code>$("input.formreset").click(function() {
    formmodified = 0;
});
</code></pre>
    </div>

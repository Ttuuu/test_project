<p>Another method is to do something closer to this. Note that I have no idea if this code is ok, but it worked in Google Docs when I made it a standalone function.</p>

<pre><code>var yourself = {
fibonacci : function(n) {
    var n0 = 0;
    var n1 = 1;
    var n2;
    for (var l = 2; l &lt;= n; l++) {
        n2 = n0 + n1;
        n0 = n1;
        n1 = n2;
    }
    return n2;
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>This method has you work upwards from <code>0</code> to <code>n</code> (instead of downwards from <code>n</code> to <code>0</code>) and store the results in three variables as you go. It makes things faster since you don't have to find <code>fibbonacci(n-1)</code> twice, <code>fibbonacci(n-2)</code> three times, etc.</p>

<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p><span class="math-container">\$O(k + \log n)\$</span> seems highly suspect to me. For large values of <span class="math-container">\$n\$</span> this is equivalent to <span class="math-container">\$O(\log n)\$</span> while for small values it's equivalent to <span class="math-container">\$O(k)\$</span>. That they specified <span class="math-container">\$O(kn)\$</span> up-front processing leads me to consider the use of a hash table, but I don't see a structure that would provide the "closest-neighbor" capability required by the problem statement.</p>

<p>Obviously, this doesn't answer your "How can I do this?" question, but I question that it's even possible given their requirements, assuming you captured them accurately.</p>

<p>At this point, someone will likely provide a perfectly valid solution to blow my mind. :)</p>

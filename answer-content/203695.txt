<p>First of all I would define a function that takes two valid HTML color strings and returns a valid HTML color string that represents the average of the two.</p>

<p>With this approach you could avoid polluting your "color library code" with calls to host objects, which helps for better code reuse. DOM manipulation and input validation (e.g. by a regex) could then be done in seperate functions.</p>

<p>Your solution returns <code>#0080</code> as the average of <code>#0000ff</code> and <code>#000000</code>. This is because you do not format the RGB values separately with leading zeros.</p>

<p>To fulfill the ECMAScript 5 requirement I would suggest strict mode.</p>

<p>You could exploit Laravel collections to achieve what you need.</p>

<p>Most of your code is checking for the presence/absence of props on your arrays. Laravel internally exposes and uses the <code>Illuminate\Support\Arr</code> class that contains a lot of useful methods to work with arrays without the hassles of checking for key existance.<br>
It also allows you to use dot notation to get nested properties in a really simple way.</p>

<p>Laravel collection methods (<a href="https://laravel.com/docs/master/collections#available-methods%5D" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>)  use this class where needed. Therefore, the refactored code would become really intuitive and should look like this (it may need a little bit of tweaking based on your <code>userNotificationPreference</code> and <code>preferences</code> arrays and how you retrieve them from the model:</p>

<pre class="lang-php prettyprint-override"><code>$recipients-&gt;map-&gt;getUser()
    -&gt;where("userNotificationPreference.preferences.{$sendMethod}", true)
    -&gt;where("userNotificationPreference.preferences.specific-templates.0.{$notification-&gt;getTemplateCode()}.0.{$sendMethod}", true);
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I used <code>-&gt;map-&gt;getUser()</code> that would be equivalent to:</p>

<pre class="lang-php prettyprint-override"><code>$recipients-&gt;map(function ($recipient) {
    return $recipient-&gt;getUser();
})
</code></pre>

<p>However, if you really need to pluck the user instance through the user repository then you can do:</p>

<pre class="lang-php prettyprint-override"><code>$recipients-&gt;map(function ($recipient) use ($userRepository) {
    return $userRepository-&gt;findByParams([
        'email' =&gt; $recipient-&gt;getUser()-&gt;email
    ]);
})-&gt;where(...);
</code></pre>

<p>and chain the where calls after that.</p>

<p>If any part of my code is unclear or doesn't work, let me know in the comments and I'll explain/fix it.</p>

<p>First this is probably C++ rather than C, the C programming language does not support function overloading (blink as an example).</p>

<p><strong>Magic Numbers</strong>  </p>

<p>In programming a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Magic Number</a> is a numeric constant in code that doesn't identify what is is. Magic numbers make the code harder to understand, debug and maintain. When magic numbers are used as a basis for arrays it means that the code may need to be edited in multiple places rather than just in one location.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>int *colors[10];

for (c = 0; c &lt; 10; c++)
{
    do_something_with_color(colors[c]);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This would be easier to modify and maintain if a symbolic constant was defined.</p>

<pre><code>int const MAX_COLORS = 10;
int *colors[MAX_COLORS];

for (c = 0; c &lt; MAX_COLORS; c++)
{
    do_something_with_color(colors[c]);
}
</code></pre>

<p>There are a large number of numeric constants in the program, in very few cases they have been defined using <code>int const SYMBOLIC_NAME = value</code>. It might be better if all the numeric constants were defined in this manner. Some examples of these numeric constants are 700, 581, 500, 2000, 4000, etc.</p>

<p>Are 500, 2000 and 4000 milliseconds?</p>

<p><strong>Comments</strong><br>
The comments</p>

<pre><code>    //Really Dry!: 580-
    //Needs water: 700 - 581
    //Could be wetter: 740 - 701
</code></pre>

<p>aren't very meaningful in this context. If you want to create a block comment that describes what the LED is being used for and then base the symbolic name of the constants on this block comment it might be more helpful.</p>

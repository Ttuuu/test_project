<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>You can find the minimal amounts by segregating each key:value where the key is days and values are people:</p>

<pre><code>ls = [[2,4], [3, 9], [4,9], [9, 3]] # your data
print(ls)
ns = {days: people-days for days, people in ls if days &lt; people} 
print(ns)
</code></pre>

<p>This returns:</p>

<pre><code>[[2, 4], [3, 9], [4, 9], [9, 3]]
{2: 2, 3: 6, 4: 5} # value is now the difference between days and people
</code></pre>

<p>From here you can see the largest difference which will be your minimal and maximum.</p>

<p>Don't split up dates into year/month/day, instead use a <code>static DateTime</code>. Which means you need to rename your <code>Constants</code> class to something like <code>Setup</code> or <code>Configuration</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Your <code>Main</code> is a 200+ lines long method. You should split this up into smaller methods and maybe even move some of those to dedicated classes.</p>

<hr>

<p>Don't create your own (primitive) logging system, instead use an established platform like NLog or Serilog.</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm somewhat baffled by the meaning of <code>public const int Symbol = 1;</code>. Especially since there is also a variable named <code>symbol</code>. Names should convey a meaning, and that seems to be totally lacking here.</p>

<hr>

<p>Why do you loop through all the columns in a row when you only need the second one?</p>

<hr>

<p>This code is repeated four times with only minimal changes:</p>

<pre><code>float q1;
if (float.TryParse(earnings.Descendants("td").ElementAt(1).InnerText.Trim('%'), out q1))
{
    Console.WriteLine(q1);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Don't copy-paste code; instead move this to a dedicated method.</p>

<hr>

<p>Do not pointlessly abbreviate: <code>currDate</code> is harder to read than <code>currentdate</code> and doesn't gain you anything.</p>

<h2>Edit / Update:</h2>

<p>I noticed that you have a misplaced curly bracket (<code>}</code>) that makes it so that your last class is inside of your first class, <strong>meaning that this code shouldn't compile</strong>.  </p>

<hr>

<p>For some reason I don't like <code>Else if</code> at the end of an <code>if..then..else</code> block, that might just be personal style/opinion but I figured that I would throw that out there.  </p>

<p>I also noticed that there were a couple of <code>If...then...else</code> blocks that end with an <code>Else if</code> like this one</p>

<pre><code>if (current.F == value.F)
{
    return;
}
else if (value.F &lt; current.F)
{
    if (n.left == null)
    {
        current.left = n;
        break;
    }
    else
    {
        current = current.left;
    }
}
else if (value.F &gt; current.F)
{
    if (current.right == null)
    {
        current.right = n;
        break;
    }
    else
    {
        current = current.right;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I would probably rewrite it like</p>

<pre><code>if (current.F == value.F)
{
    return;
}
else if (value.F &lt; current.F)
{
    if (n.left == null)
    {
        current.left = n;
        break;
    }
    else
    {
        current = current.left;
    }
}
else 
{
    if (current.right == null)
    {
        current.right = n;
        break;
    }
    else
    {
        current = current.right;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that I changed <code>else if (value.F &gt; current.F)</code> to <code>else</code>, I didn't see how there could be another case after that, so showing that anything other then the first two cases would fall into this category.</p>

<p>your <code>if...then...else</code> blocks can really screw with an application, you can have all the right code in them but have them in totally the wrong order,  I would be specific in the way that you form them and have a set pattern that you use, so that when you look back at it you can tell what is priority one, because the first one it hits is the only one it hits and then it ducks out of the <code>if</code> statement.</p>

<p>As far as the <code>Delete()</code> Method, add it and see if it works the way you intend it to.</p>

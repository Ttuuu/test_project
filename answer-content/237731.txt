<p>A low-hanging fruit will be defining some interfaces of datastores such as <code>MyDB</code> so that some details can be hidden from the controller code. For instance:</p>

<pre><code> const storeData = new MyDB();
 storeData.employee_id = empId;
 storeData.work_id = workId;
 storeData.value = value;
 storeData.date_start = date_start;
 storeData.date_end = date_end;
 storeData.status = 3;
 storeData.group_name = groupName;
 await storeData.save();
</code></pre>

<p>can be refactored to something like:</p>

<pre><code> MyDBBuilder
     .with(getData)
     .withStatus(3)
     .withGroupName(groupName)
     .save();
</code></pre>

<p>The complexity comes from the fact that it takes 4 steps to complete this business transaction. Unless there is a way to redefine data schema, all we can do here is to encapsulate the complexity and not expose it in the controller code. 
In some cases, it might be appropriate to have all the db operations in some stored procedure, if you are not concerned with portability.  </p>

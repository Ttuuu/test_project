<h2>OOAD - Object Orientated Analyze and Design</h2>
<p>It's  always a good idea to start with a pen and a pencil <strong>before</strong> you do any coding. Here is a demonstration on how such an Design could look like (I strongly recommend UML since this kind of diagramms is understood by everybody among engineers)</p>

<p>Honestly I do not fully understand your requirements (your homework task), so this design maybe a flawed. Take it and adjust it to your needs.</p>
<h2>Pets</h2>
<p>Since bringing pets to your room is not depending on any room feature (the hotel management might allow as an exception to bring your pet to a <em>regular</em> room) this feature is only a pricing feature. Having a <strong>design</strong> in your hands now, you can easily decide, where to put such extra-chargings into: the <code>Booking</code>! this is also where your breakfast should be.</p>
<h2>Helpful hints</h2>
<ul>
<li>Avoid static members and methods, use your design and put them into the proper class</li>
<li>Stick with the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/codeconventions-namingconventions.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">java naming style guide</a> on naming</li>

<li>Look at the comments: <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/3023/gilbert-le-blanc">Gilbert Le Blanc</a> said:  Basically, every noun in the problem description is a potential class object</li>
<li>Additional: every verb is a method</li>

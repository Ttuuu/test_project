<blockquote>
  <p>Question 1: Can global parameters be accessed to build a view, or does it break the pattern?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand your question as:<br>
<em>Should  parameters controlling the view itself be part of the model layer?</em> </p>

<p>My answer to that would be: yes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Question 2: Are my exceptions sane, or I am doing something wrong?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The questions are: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>does the caller need to destinguish between different of your exceptions (for other reason then showing the right error message)? </p>

<p>If not you don't need custom exceptions at all.</p></li>
<li><p>does the caller need to destinguish between your exceptions and prefefines system Exceptions like i.e. <code>NullPointerException</code> (for other reason then showing the right error message)? </p>

<p>If you answered the previous question with "yes" and this with "no" a single custom exception may be enough.</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Question 3: is it reasonnable to unit-test the parameters to make sure that they are not set to a value that will break stuff?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unittest verify any <strong>behavior</strong> that is important for your <em>business logic</em>. This means, you don't test <em>data</em> like "parameters". </p>

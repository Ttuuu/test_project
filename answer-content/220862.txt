<p>The best solution here is a modified counting sort. If we store the first integer not yet found, we can move an element of value <code>i</code> to the ith spot of the array until we find a duplicate or something bigger than the array size, at which point we throw that away and go to the next index. At the end of this process, we will have an array where the first <code>i</code> elements of the array have the value <code>i</code>.</p>

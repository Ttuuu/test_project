<p>i would rewrite your equals method a bit (just for readability)</p>

<pre><code>public boolean equals(Object other) {
    if(this == other) {
        return true;
    }

    if(!(other instanceof Concept)) {
        return false;        
    }

    Concept otherConcept = (Concept) other;

    return id.equals(otherConcept.id);
  }
</code></pre>

<p>And concerning your parameterized constructor I don't see anything the speaks against this. It is part of the contract of you model and if you don't intend to use this class in any framework that requires a parameterless constructor to work i think we are fine</p>

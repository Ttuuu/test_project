<p>The brackets (<code>[]</code>) aren't purely decorative, they specify that you're creating a list.  The <code>TypeError</code> you got told you that you're supposed to pass in a single string, not a list of strings.</p>

<p>You probably also don't want the trailing <code>/</code> on that path, since it's (hopefully) not part of the actual directory name.  In general you shouldn't hard-code path separators since they aren't OS-portable (that's why <code>os.path.join</code> exists).</p>

<p>Give this a try:</p>

<pre><code>STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')
</code></pre>

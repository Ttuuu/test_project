<p>Evaluating Asymptotic Complexity e.g. with gmp library, shows that rcgldr's algorithm, implementing efficient matrix powers with O(log(n)) mutlipications, has best performance among presented algorithms.</p>

<p>Below compared for n in range 0 .... 647028207</p>

<ol>
<li>Straight Iteration, n steps, takes <em>O(n^1.60)</em> time.</li>
<li>"Golden Ratio", i.e. above called the "Binet's Formula" due to floating arithmetics takes <em>O(n^1.25)</em> time</li>
<li>rcgldr's algorithm with <em>O(n^1.029)</em> time.</li>
</ol>

<p>The diagram shows evaluation time for <em>Fn</em> in seconds over <em>n</em>, both axis logarithmic with base 10,

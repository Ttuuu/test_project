<p>For hash brute-forcing, the short answer is "don't do it in Python". You'll get massive performance gains in switching to C or C++.</p>

<p>Since this is for learning purposes, reviewing your Python:</p>

<ul>
<li>For legibility, add a newline between your imports and your code.</li>
<li>Consider putting your global-scope code into a <code>main()</code> function plus subdividing some of the code into other functions.</li>
<li>Does your code actually run? You have a loop on <code>ready</code>, but you don't modify its value, so I think it's going to hang there. I suspect that you've broken your loop's indentation, and that some statements below belong in the loop.</li>
<li>Instead of setting <code>ready</code> to later break out of the loop, you can simply <code>break</code>. You can get rid of your <code>else/continue</code>.</li>
</ul>

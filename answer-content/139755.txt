<p>Your code looks fine. Just some notes:</p>

<h1>Excel</h1>

<p>The main weakness of your design as I see it is its reliance on the Excel application. Since you say robustness is important, Excel would be the main weak point. Microsoft says <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/257757">don't use Office as a server</a>. From my own bitter experience, I think they are right to say that. </p>

<p>It's not so bad in your case because you are doing the same thing over and over, so there should be no surprises, but you never know. Excel can be flakey. It can pop up dialogs that will halt processing. It's especially flakey if you are processing multiple documents simultaneously because Excel was never designed to handle that case.</p>

<p>As an alternative, you could use a library to produce your Excel, such as <a href="https://epplus.codeplex.com/">EPPlus</a>. I've never used that, so I can't endorse it, but it looks good. There may be others out there too. Remember that it's easy to use .Net libraries from PowerShell.</p>

<h1>HTML</h1>

<p>Your HTML is very nearly XHTML. It looks like just the <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tags would need to be fixed. If you have control over the thing that produces the HTML, then you could change it to produce XHTML instead, and then you could consume that with <code>Import-XML</code>. I'm guessing that's not the case, but I thought it worth mentioning.</p>

<h1>Error Handling</h1>

<p>You don't have any error handling. If you want your code to be robust you will have to think about what it should do when things go wrong.</p>

<h1>Write-Host</h1>

<pre><code>Write-Host "Formating Excel file"
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to capture these messages in a log, then it would be better to use <code>Write-Output</code>.</p>

<h1>Line Continuation</h1>

<pre><code>$tableRange = $sheet.Range($sheet.Cells($startRow, 1), ` 
    $sheet.Cells($startRow + $numberOfRows - 1, $endColumn)) 
</code></pre>

<p>I don't believe you need to use the backtick character there.</p>

<h1>-Include</h1>

<pre><code>$htmlFiles = Get-ChildItem -path $Directory -Recurse -Include index.html
</code></pre>

<p>One oddity of PowerShell is that <code>-Filter</code> is much faster than <code>-Include</code>. If the number of folders and files you are searching is small, then it doesn't matter, but if you are searching through lots of them, it can make a huge difference. </p>

<p>(What is the difference in functionality between the two? None, except that <code>-Include</code> is more general and will work in non-filesystems, but that isn't relevant here.)</p>

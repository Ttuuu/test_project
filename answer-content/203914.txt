<p>Some quick remarks   </p>

<ul>
<li>Name you things properly. E.g <code>comboBox3</code> will make you wonder what it is, if you come in 2 months to fix a bug or add some functionality. Always name your things in a way that you see at first glance what they are about.  </li>
<li>Instead of using <code>DateTime.Parse()</code> inside a <code>try..catch</code> where you swallow every exception you either should use <code>DateTime.TryParse()</code> or catch the <code>FormatException</code> which the method would throw. But not only catching you should but for a gui you should also inform the user that something went wrong.  </li>
<li><p>Inside the <code>button1_Click()</code> method you could avoid the <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?ArrowAntiPattern" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Arrow Anti Pattern</a> which makes your code almost unreadable, by returning early like e.g  </p>

<pre><code>if (comboBox1.SelectedIndex != -1)
{
    MessageBox.Show("Select Program", "Error", MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Warning);
    return;
}
if (comboBox2.SelectedIndex != -1)
{
    MessageBox.Show("Select Workflow", "Error", MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Warning);
    return ;
}  

....  
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>commented out code is dead code which should be removed like e.g  </p>

<pre><code>//private void textBox_TextChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)
//{


//}  
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>In <code>calcuate_values()</code> you have used some <code>using</code>'s which is the way to go but unfortunately you have forgotten to enclose the using of <code>SqlDataReader</code> in a <code>using</code> as well.  </p></li>
<li>While we are at <code>calcuate_values()</code> I would like to mention that it is a good habit to stick to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229002.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">.NET Naming Guidelines</a> because other developers will do as well and it becomes easier for them to read your code.</li>
<li>The name of <code>ClearTextBoxes()</code> is misleading because it "resets" comboboxes as well.  </li>
<li>The formatting of your code (the indentation of the lines)  looks strange but maybe this is due to copy pasting it here.  </li>
<li>Blank lines are a good way to group related stuff but to many of them are reducing the readability.</li>
</ul>

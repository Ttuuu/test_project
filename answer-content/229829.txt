<p>You have a lot of places where you do something like</p>

<pre><code>if int(p1) &gt; int(p2):
    who_won.append(1)
else:
    who_won.append(2)
</code></pre>

<p>There's more duplication than necessary here. At the very least, you should move the call to <code>append</code> out so it's only called once. If you every change how <code>who_won</code> works, you don't want to have to change a ton of things all over. The less places you use it the easier it will be to refactor later. You can use a conditional expression here:</p>

<pre><code>who_won.append(1 if int(p1) &gt; int(p2) else 2)
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>You're comparing against <code>True</code> in a few places:</p>

<pre><code>elif p1.isdigit() == True and p2.isdigit() == True:
</code></pre>

<p>This is unnecessary. <code>if</code> already interprets what you give it as either "truthy" or "falsey". <code>== True</code> is redundant. Just reduce it to:</p>

<pre><code>elif p1.isdigit() and p2.isdigit():
</code></pre>

<p>That reads much more fluently anyways.</p>

<hr>

<p>At the top, you have a giant chunk consisting of calls to <code>print</code>:</p>

<pre><code>print(game_logic()),
print("\n"),
print(" __________________________________"),
print("|        WIN COUNTER DELUXE        |"),
. . .
</code></pre>

<p>Calling <code>print</code> excessively isn't a good idea, even though it won't really matter here. I would expect it to be more performant (and more readable) to use a single <code>print</code> with a <code>sep="\n"</code> argument passed:</p>

<pre><code>print(game_logic(),
      "\n",
      " __________________________________",
      "|        WIN COUNTER DELUXE        |",
      . . .
      sep="\n")  # sep="\n" tells it to insert a newline between arguments
</code></pre>

<hr>

<pre><code>card_shuffle = [random.choice(cards) for i in cards]
</code></pre>

<p>This doesn't seem like a "shuffle". This will, unless I'm overlooking something, not return a list with the original proportion of cards. It will randomly have more of different cards than others. Just use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/random.html#random.shuffle" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>random.shuffle</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>random.shuffle(cards)  # Shuffles inplace instead of returning a new list.
</code></pre>

<p>If you wanted to avoid mutating the original, just <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2612802/how-to-clone-or-copy-a-list">make a copy first</a>:</p>

<pre><code>random.shuffle(cards[:])
</code></pre>

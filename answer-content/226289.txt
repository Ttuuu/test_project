<p>The code looks straight-forward and really optimized for size and simplicity.</p>

<p>There's a small detail that I would change, though: replace <code>cmove</code> with <code>cmovz</code>, to make the code more expressive. It's not that "being equal" would be of any interest here, it's the zeroness of <code>%ecx</code> that is interesting.</p>

<p>I like the omitted second <code>jmp</code> in memmove. It's obvious after thinking a few seconds about it.</p>

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/26104615">According to this quote</a> it's ok to rely on the direction flag being always cleared.</p>

<p>I still suggest to write a few unit tests to be on the safe side.</p>

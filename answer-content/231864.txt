<h1><em>This answer pertains to using <code>while run</code> vs <code>while True</code>.</em></h1>

<p>Lets say you have this code:</p>

<pre><code>run = True
    count = 0
    while run:
        if count == 5:
            run = False
        count += 1
        print(count)
</code></pre>

<p>Simple enough code. When viewing it as this, a programmer might see that the code will stop when <code>count</code> reaches <code>5</code>. Lets look at the output:</p>

<pre><code>1
2
3
4
5
6
</code></pre>

<p>Woah, whats this? <code>6</code> was printed even though the program was supposed to stop at <code>5</code>. This happens because even though <code>run</code> is now <code>False</code>, it doesn't immediately exit the loop. This prevents the <em>next iteration</em> from running. So, any code in the rest of the loop will run regardless of what <code>run</code> is.</p>

<p>Now lets look at using <code>while True</code>:</p>

<pre><code>count = 0
while True:
    if count == 5:
        break
    count += 1
    print(count)
</code></pre>

<p>And the output</p>

<pre><code>1
2
3
4
5
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>break</code> <em>immediately</em> exits the loop, preventing <code>count</code> from being incremented a final time.</p>

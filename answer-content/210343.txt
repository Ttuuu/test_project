<p>Overall the code is okay but can definitely be improved.</p>

<p>Some things I would however change.</p>

<p>Instead of writing short variable names and then explaining them in comments, a better approach is to have "self-documenting code". What this means is to make your variables descriptive enough to convey to the reader what they represent.</p>

<p>An example is in your method</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * @param o an OctreeNode.
 * @param u an OctreeNode.
 * @return the distance between the two nodes.
 */
public static double distance(OctreeNode o, OctreeNode u) {
</code></pre>

<p>Here you can simply use firstNode and secondNode since we are returning the distance between them.</p>

<p>Here is another example:</p>

<pre><code>/**
* Compute the WSPD from an octree and a threshold s.
* @param T the Octree,
* @param s threshold.
* @return the pairs of WSPD.
*/
public OctreeNode[][] wspd (Octree T, double epsilon) {
</code></pre>

<p>Here the T would be better called a tree, or the threshold would be better called exactly that, the threshold. Also, I don't see the parameter you mentioned passed into the function (possibly a bug)?</p>

<pre><code>Pair(X xx, Y yy) {
         x = xx;
         y = yy;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Here I would change xx and yy, as they could be better represented with a different variable name.</p>

<p>Over here, what are these nodes?</p>

<pre><code>OctreeNode u, OctreeNode v
</code></pre>

<p>It would be preferred to describe them, so that it's easier to see what's going on when you use these variables throughout your code.</p>

<pre><code>@param p a Point_3.
</code></pre>

<p>Why is a <code>Point_3</code> here is the only object which has an underscore? You want to pick a naming style and consistently use it. Inconsistency in code leads to possible subtle bugs down the road - along with difficulty for an outside reader to follow it.</p>

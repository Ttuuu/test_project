<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>Let's first look at what you are printing:</p>

<pre><code>((10**i -1)//9)*((10**i -1)//9) 

#that is the math task, from which you are printing the result
</code></pre>

<p>You asked what <code>*</code> means.
This is the multiplication operator...</p>

<p>Let's look at the other things, so you get a better understanding of what is going on</p>

<pre><code>result = 10**i - 1
</code></pre>

<p>Here you are doing 10 to the power of i and then minus one.
The <code>**</code> operator means to the power of...</p>

<p>So <code>2**4</code> means 2^4 or two to the power of four.</p>

<p>Then you are dividing the result of that task with 9 <code>(result)//9</code> 
You are using <code>//</code> which is the floor division. This will cut of the decimal place.</p>

<p>The right side after the <code>*</code> is just the same as the first one.
You multiply them with the <code>*</code> operator.</p>

<pre><code>result = (10**i -1)//9
print( result * result ) #Multiplication
</code></pre>

<p>I hope that this helped you.</p>

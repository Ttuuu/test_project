<p>Your class is small and does what you said it should, that's good.<br>
However, there are a few things you could do better.</p>
<h3>1. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39004292/why-do-we-prefer-primitives-to-boxed-primitives-in-java">Use primitive types unless the boxed ones are specifically needed</a>:</h3>
<p>You are using the <code>Integer</code> type for counting the position and storing/returning data. If you actually used the fact, that it could be <code>null</code>, this would be acceptable use. However, any instance of <code>null</code> would break your code here. You are storing your integers in an <code>int[]</code>, a primitive integer array. This leads to unboxing and a <code>null</code> reference will break your code.<br>
A position of <code>null</code> (not zero <code>0</code>) also isn't making any sense in the context of your class.</p>
<p>Use <code>int</code> instead of <code>Integer</code> unless you actually need <code>null</code> references.</p>
<h3>2. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17393736/why-it-is-recommended-to-declare-instance-variables-as-private">Reduce the visibility of member fields</a></h3>
<p>Other classes inside the same package as your class typically don't need access to your internal array. Make that array <code>private</code>.</p>
<h3>3. Think about what you want to store in your stack.</h3>
<p>Currently your stack only allows storing primitive <code>int</code>s. Maybe think about storing any type of data using generics. Extending your current class wouldn't be difficult.</p>
<p>Other than that: Your code is concise, not too complicated and serves its purpose. Think about formatting the code using your IDE's formatter and add comments and documentation to your code.</p>

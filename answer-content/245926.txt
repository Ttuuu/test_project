<p>Imagine a variant on FizzBuzz with <span class="math-container">\$n\$</span> different say-this-syllable-if rules. Would you want to check <span class="math-container">\$2^n\$</span> cases? That will lead to either a lot of code (<span class="math-container">\$O(2^n)\$</span> lines) or deeply nested code (with <span class="math-container">\$O(n)\$</span> maximum indentation). Luckily, the problem statement does you a favour: on divisibility by 15, it asks you to print FizzBuzz, not Fizz Buzz with a space as you tried. So the clean-code approach (with <span class="math-container">\$O(n)\$</span> lines, and <span class="math-container">\$O(1)\$</span> maximum indentation) is more like this:</p>
<pre><code>public class FizzBuzz {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int number = 1; number &lt;= 100; number++) {
            String toPrint = "";
            if(number % 3 == 0) {
                toPrint += "Fizz";
            }
            if(number % 5 == 0) {
                toPrint += "Buzz";
            }
            if (toPrint.isEmpty()) {
                toPrint = Integer.toString(number);
            }
            System.out.println(toPrint);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Even in this case, where <span class="math-container">\$n=2\$</span>, this approach has definite advantages. You easily avoid what-if-both problems, <em>and it's obvious to a reader that you did</em>. No need to think through boolean logic. Tom Scott discusses the advantages further <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPZ0pIK_wsc" rel="noreferrer">here</a>, albeit for JavaScript, not Java.</p>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8020228/is-it-ok-if-i-omit-curly-braces-in-java">A separate issue</a> is whether we even need all those braces.</p>
<p>(By the way, I depluralized your dummy variable's name, so it doesn't look like a list of numbers.)</p>

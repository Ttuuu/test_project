<p>There are some things I would do differently.  I think <code>GetScheduleList</code> should be a public method in your <code>PlantConfiguration</code> class.</p>

<p>The primary method you are concerned about, <code>UpdateValues</code> is private.  You declare <code>schedulesToUpdate</code> as an enumerable collection, but initialize it as a list.  Given the method is private, I would make <code>schedulesToUpdate</code> a list and just use <code>Add</code> instead of <code>Concat</code>.</p>

<p>You do nothing with <code>ForceHour</code> in <code>GetUtcTopHourDate</code>.  Also, naming conventions would want it to be camel cased, so <code>forceHour</code> would be more appropriate.  Furthermore, it should be a <code>bool</code> rather than an <code>int</code> with a default magic number of -1.</p>

<p>The logic within <code>GetScheduleList</code> leaves me confused.  Again, there is a magic number with <code>Hour == 0</code>.  I see you wanting to get a schedule in effect for a certain time.  The <code>HourlySchedule</code> is returned always regardless of what time of day it is.  The <code>DailySchedule</code> is returned only if the time of time occurs locally from 12:00 AM inclusively until 1:00 AM exclusively.  I would think whatever time of day I ask for that I should get all schedules, hourly and daily, that are in effect for that specific time.</p>

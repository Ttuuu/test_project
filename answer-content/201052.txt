<p>What is the purpose of your code ? Without clear intentions it is harder to review it because many decisions may be taken regarding a context that we don't have.</p>

<p>From what I see, both <code>Ryan</code> and <code>Nate</code> can be two instances of the same <code>Human</code> class. The thing that vary are the <em>name</em> and <em>height</em>, so there is two variables required to create an <code>Human</code>. Since they are required, you should add them as constructor parameters so that once your instance is created, it is ready to be used. </p>

<p>If you want to control your instances, be sure that only <em>Ryan</em> and <em>Nate</em>  are created, you can use a <em>factory</em> of <em>factory method</em>.</p>

<p>Interfaces with different implementations are used when the behavior is different. In your case, there is no need to have those two implementations, they complexify your code were it is not needed (see K.I.S.S.) and they duplicate the "logic". Never try to use patterns or style when this is not necessary. </p>

<p>Do you know the meaning of <em>S.O.L.I.D.</em> ? Take a look at it and specially the Liskov part.  You can also search for _K.I.S.S. and Y.A.G.N.I. they are all useful.</p>

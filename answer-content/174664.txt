<p>Instead of using <code>else</code> followed by a line-break and then using the <code>if</code> statement, you can just use the <code>elsif</code> statement, which combines the two. It's a minor thing, but it's slightly more "elegant". Usually I only use the <code>else</code> statement if the value is purely boolean rather than conditional. Also, I added in a line code that factors in if the users just presses <kbd>enter</kbd> (meaning they don't have any input at all) by using:</p>

<pre><code>elsif user_input == ""
    puts "ARE YOU GOING TO TALK?!"
</code></pre>

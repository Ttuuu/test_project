<p>The provided code sample is incomplete, so I don't know the control flow at runtime.<br>
However, this is what I noticed:<br>
The variables are static and so is <code>getBlockLookingAt()</code> method.  However, the reflection code is done in the constructor of <code>GetTargetBlock113</code> class. a more suitable place would be the static constructor of the class. depending on how many times the ctor is called, it might improve performance as well.</p>

<p>This a great first time GUI setup.
Only saw a few things I would change to make it easier on yourself.
I don't see anything wrong with your Function.</p>

<p>Things that need work:</p>

<p>1.Line 9 to 14: These are unnecessary as you already started using grid. Yet this is good practice. Just not needed for this program.</p>

<p>2.Also try to organize your code better. It helps yourself and also others to quickly identify what the code is doing. I made a few tweaks to your code. Organized it a bit, and made a few minor changes. Placed everything using Grid and Tidied up the GUI a bit.</p>

<pre><code>"""Geometry and Title"""
root.title('Coinflipper')
root.geometry("300x100")
root.resizable(False,False)

"""Labels &amp; Text Box"""
choice = Label(text="How Many Flips: ")
T = Label(text="Tails: ")
H = Label(text="Heads: ")
ent = Entry(root)
out = Text(width=15, height=1)
out2 = Text(width=15, height=1)

"""Grid Positions"""
choice.grid(row=0, column=0, sticky=E)
T.grid(row=1,column=0,sticky=E)
H.grid(row=2,column=0,sticky=E)
ent.grid(row=0, column=1, columnspan=3)
out.grid(row=1, column=1, columnspan=3)
out2.grid(row=2, column=1, columnspan=3)

"""Button Text and Position"""
clickit = Button(text="FLIP THE COIN!!!")
clickit.grid(row=3,column=1)

<p>Overall great work!</p>

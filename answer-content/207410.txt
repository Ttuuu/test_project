<p>The code you've provided is fairly thin and so there's not to much to pick at here, however, I think your checks on <code>roles</code> and <code>cbs</code> can be simplified using <code>Array.isArray()</code>, because the for of iterator cannot iterate an empty array.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>if (roles &amp;&amp; roles.length) {
  for (let role of roles) {
    if (userRoles.indexOf(role) !== -1) return next();
  }
}
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>can be transformed to:</p>

<pre><code>if (Array.isArray(roles)) {
  for (let role of roles) {
    if (userRoles.indexOf(role) !== -1) return next();
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Although I think these checks would be better moved up and for you to return a 500 Server Error if <code>roles</code> or <code>cbs</code> aren't arrays.</p>

<p>In the same block of code you have <code>indexOf(role) !== -1</code>, which was simplified to <code>.includes(role)</code> in ES6.</p>

<p>The only other thing that comes to mind is the <code>userRoles.split(',')</code> call, because, if <code>userRoles</code> isn't a string, it'll raise an exception. However, that would depend on how malleable your database / validation is.</p>

<p>Additionally, your second suggested prototype has way more confusing usage than your implementation, I would stick with what you've created.</p>

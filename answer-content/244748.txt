<h2>You're not my library!</h2>
<p>I think it unwise to add additional symbols to <code>std</code>. It's great to use a namespace for the purpose of defining a library, but it's both surprising and confusing for a third-party user to need to use <code>std</code> to get your code which is not STL code. Just make your own name.</p>

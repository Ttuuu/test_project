<p>I don't have time to check all now but I found some things I want to share</p>

<p>If you are using C++17 consider using <code>std::variant</code> instead of the weak union inherited from c. It will probaly also solve youre isue with <code>std::string</code>. See: <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/variant" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/variant</a></p>

<p>Consider using <code>'\n'</code> instead of <code>std::endl</code>. Im pretty sure you only want a newline and not also a expensive flush of the buffer: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/213907/c-stdendl-vs-n">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/213907/c-stdendl-vs-n</a>.</p>

<p>Consider using the more safe <code>enum class</code> instead of plain c <code>enum</code>. It is available since C++11.</p>

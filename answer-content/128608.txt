<p>There is a simple solution that does not require a dictionary:</p>

<pre><code>int[] A = { 9, 3, 9, 3, 9, 7, 9};
int result = 0;
foreach (var i in A)
    result ^= i;
Console.WriteLine(result); // 7
</code></pre>

<p>The trick here is, that "a xor a" gives 0. So all number will be erased except the single one.</p>

<hr>

<p>Or in short:</p>

<pre><code>var result = new [] { 9, 3, 9, 3, 9, 7, 9}.Aggregate(0, (a, b) =&gt; a^b);
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>To you solution with the dictionary:</p>

<p>You don't need a dictionary. You could just use a Hashset. Add a new entry if the entry does not exists and remove the entry if it already exists. After processing all items, the hashset should have one item - the result.</p>

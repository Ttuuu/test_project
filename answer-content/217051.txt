<p>The numbers you insert must be monotonic increasing (either strictly larger than the last or equal to it).</p>

<p>So: sort the original list smallest to largest.</p>

<p>Create a second, empty queue.</p>

<p>Peek at four values: the head and next of the sorted list, and the head and next of the queue. Remove  the lowest two, and push their sum onto the queue.</p>

<p>Of course, you could also just sum the list in O(n) time, but exploiting the fact that the sums are monotonic increasing allows you to avoid a bunch of heapifys.
Repeat until both the list and queue are empty.</p>

<p>The most common method for getting rid of the black dots is to <strong>paint over each pixel of the entire destination image</strong> with pixels copied from computed positions in the source image, instead of painting the source image pixels into computed positions in the destination image.</p>

<pre><code>for i in range(660):
    for j in range(660):
        xb = int(...)
        yb = int(...)
        if xb in range(self.width) and yb in range(self.height):
            emptyF[i, j] = self.img[xb, yb]
</code></pre>

<p>Computing destination pixels positions from the source pixel positions may result in tiny areas unpainted in the destination due to numeric errors/limits.</p>

<p>Computing source pixels positions from the destination pixel position may result in a pixel value being copied to two adjacent locations, and other pixels never being copied from, but this is usually/often unnoticeable.</p>

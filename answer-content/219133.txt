<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>Good job using <code>const</code> in your code for values and functions that don't get re-assigned. I don't often see multi-line ternary operators (especially within arrow functions) and that one in your code is a bit on the complex side.</p>
<p>You are correct- your code does not have <span class="math-container">\$O(1)\$</span> space complexity.</p>

<h3>Alternate approach</h3>
<p>Originally I thought about suggesting <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/revisions/219133/4">an approach that used <code>.findIndex()</code></a> but you pointed out that would no longer be <span class="math-container">\$O(n)\$</span> complexity.</p>
<p>I also thought about suggesting you sort the array, then iterate over each element with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Array.find()</code></a>, looking for the first item that doesn't match the next item in the list. However, I forgot that sorting the array is not exactly linear time.</p>

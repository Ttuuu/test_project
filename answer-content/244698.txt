<p>Quite often with HackerRank puzzles, there will be a check that your algorithm scales to large sizes. Here we are explicitly told that n may be up to 199 999.</p>
<p>You have managed to come up with a homebrew sort that appears to be efficient given the data constraints. However, you are calling it in the outer loop, so your algorithm appears to be O(n^2) overall.</p>
<p>Try working through the sample input "9 5 / 2 3 4 2 3 6 8 4 5" with pencil and paper; I'll bet you find it didn't involve nearly as much sorting. Then think about what data structures would best model what you did.</p>

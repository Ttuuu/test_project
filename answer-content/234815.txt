<p>You could utilize <a href="https://www.regular-expressions.info/named.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Named Capturing Groups</a> that would clarify the meaning of capturing group in the regex, as well as the method calls in the <code>matcher</code>. furthermore, with Named Capturing Groups, you don't care about the order of the groups and don't need to "skip" captured groups that you do not want to read (like the time zone)</p>

<p>you could also break the regex into separate Strings for the capturing groups to further enhance readability: </p>

<pre><code>String timeZoneRegex = "(?&lt;timeZone&gt;[A-Z][a-z][a-z],\\s+)";
String dayOfMonthRegex = "(?&lt;dayOfMonth&gt;[0-2][0-9]|[3][0-1])";
...
Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(timeZoneRegex + "?" +  dayOfMonthRegex + ...
</code></pre>

<p>instead of <code>matcher.group(1)</code> --&gt; <code>matcher.group("dayOfMonth");</code></p>
    </div>

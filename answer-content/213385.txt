<p>Writing to a document property is a concern in its own right, and thus deserves its own scope. Write a procedure that's responsible only for this!</p>

<pre><code>Public Sub IncrementHeavyDutyCount(ByVal increment As Long)
    With ThisWorkbook.CustomDocumentProperties.Item("numHD")
        .Value = .Value + increment
    End With
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>And now you can increment your counter with a simple, self-explanatory procedure call:</p>

<pre><code>If cell = "Heavy Duty" Then IncrementHeavyDutyCount 4
</code></pre>
    </div>

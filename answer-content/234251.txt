<p>Object oriented doesn't really makes sense to me here. That <code>FormattedError</code> class doesn't even represent anything, just transforming error constructor parameter to another class. </p>

<p>Also you are calling constructor, that then returns instance of something else? I don't know javascript that much so maybe it's some unknown construct to me, but that looks like something terribly wrong.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>I see no relevance to code being UI code or not.</p>

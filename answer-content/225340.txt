<p>This code does not implement a rolling hash. For every iteration of the main loop, the hash is reset and then entirely re-calculated from nothing with an inner loop. A rolling hash would remove a character from the hash and then add a new character, doing only a constant amount of work per sub-string.</p>

<p>There are some edge-cases for you to work out, but main element of the technique is this:</p>

<pre><code>hash = hash - s1[kal - len2] + s1[kal]
</code></pre>

<p>No inner loop. Also no <code>- 96</code> because it is cancelled out.</p>

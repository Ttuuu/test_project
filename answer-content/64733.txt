<p>It does not seem useful since you will be stuck with <code>Object</code>s and you won't know what to do with them.  </p>

<p>You should either use some ORM framework, or else write yourself some specific class that corresponds to the type of the entries in the DB.  For example, if each entry has two integers and one string, define some class with those members.  You can then define a function that takes a DB row and transforms it to your class.  You won't have to look at the metadata since you know beforehand what is in the DB.</p>

<p>Since a <code>ResultSet</code> might not fit in memory (in a <code>Vector</code>), you should look at Scala's <code>Stream</code> which is a lazy collection.  You can somewhat think of a <code>Stream</code> as a "while/yield comprehension".</p>

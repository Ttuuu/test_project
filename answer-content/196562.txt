<p>As I see there is about 60 properties for each item in Wynncraft DB. I see two ways to improve your design:</p>

<ol>
<li>Distribute all properties across multiple schemas: basic item information (name, category, etc), defense information, bonus damage information and other. In this case those schemas will be related to each other. Maybe you don't even need to store all item's data (depends on goal of your application).</li>
<li>If you want to identically map properties of item to your storage, then I guess you can get list of all properties as JSON (by using Wynncraft's public API) and convert it to schema definition. JSON with list of properties could be cached for better performance.</li>
</ol>
    </div>

<p>Great start!  People have already given good advice in terms of improving the solution, but I'd like to comment on some things that could be improved on even though they aren't relevant in the "cleaned up" versions people have posted.</p>

<ul>
<li>you can iterate over a dictionary, so there's no need to turn it into a list first. Iterating over like this: <code>for i in dl:</code> will give you the keys, and like this: <code>for i in dl.values():</code>  will of course give you the values.  <code>dl.items()</code> gives both as a tuple (which can be unpacked if you'd like: <code>for (key, value) in dl.items():</code>.</li>
<li>With that in mind, the <code>any</code> check could be written as <code>if any( z == 0 for z in dl.values()</code>  This is fine, but we can invert the logic (something that takes a bit of experience to recognize).  <code>if any values equal 0</code> is the same as <code>if all values are not 0</code>.  Realizing that python treats <code>0</code> as <code>false</code> and all other integers as <code>true</code> gives the slightly cleaner final form: <code>if all(dl.values()): # the number is prime</code></li>
<li>All that being said, since you aren't using the 'divisor list' <code>dl</code> except for checking if it contains a <code>0</code>, you can instead just break the loop when you find a <code>0</code> without storing the result and checking it later.  Other answers cover that in better detail.  That will be much more memory efficient and also more efficient in terms of runtime, since you can stop as soon as you find a divisor.</li>
<li>Your first while condition is unnecessary.  Since you've set <code>x = pr - 1</code>, <code>x &lt; pr</code> will always be true (provided you don't increment or set <code>x</code> to a value higher than <code>pr</code>, which of course you aren't doing)</li>
</ul>

<p>Happy Coding!</p>

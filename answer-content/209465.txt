<p>Properly formatting and indenting code is always a good start.</p>

<p>Using <code>Option Explicit</code> at the top of every module is a must. You may already do this, just thought I would mention it.</p>

<p>You declare <code>thisDate</code> as a <code>Double</code> but you use it as a <code>Date</code>. Declare it as a <code>Date</code>.</p>

<p>Make your life a little easier and set a range to the start of your new row instead of calling a calculated range. Example below:</p>

<pre><code>Private Sub Workbook_Open()  
    Dim lastRow As Long     'last row with data  
    Dim thisDate As Date  'start timestamp  
    Dim entryRange as Range
    thisDate = Now()  
    With Sheets("Pressure Log")  
        lastRow = .Range("B" &amp; .Rows.Count).End(xlUp).Row 'populate next row with date/time  
        Set entryRange = .Range("B" &amp; lastRow+1) ` There are other ways of doing this too.   
    End With  
    entryRange.resize(1, 6).Borders.LineStyle = xlContinuous  ' Yes, could do this in a With block as well.
    entryRange.Value = Format(thisDate, "dddd")  
    entryRange.Offset(, 1).Value = Format(thisDate, "mm/dd/yyyy")  
    entryRange.Offset(, 2) = Format(thisDate, "hh:mm AM/PM")  
    entryRange.Offset(, 3).Select 'position for data  
End Sub

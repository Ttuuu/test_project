<p>I spent several weeks writing and tuning <a href="https://github.com/mossrich/PowershellRecipes/blob/master/ArchiveOldLogs.ps1" rel="nofollow noreferrer">a script</a> that moves old files to a timestamped Zip file. Here are a few guidelines I learned that may help:  </p>

<p>1) Move variables into script parameters so they can be changed at runtime without editing the file: </p>

<pre><code>Param($File_Path = "C:\Users\Administrator\Downloads\Testing\*", #File path of file to be cleaned    
  $Send_To = "C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\ARCHIVE2", #Location of ZIP file
  $Old_Files = "C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\OLD_FILES", #Location of old files before being zipped
  $Days = "-65"
)
</code></pre>

<p>2) Filter usually means 'criteria for filtering a list'.  Calling the list of files <code>$Filter</code> is misleading. <code>$FilesToZip</code> might be a better variable name. </p>

<p>3) There are lots of reasons a file can't be moved or zipped (in use, doesn't exist, no read/write permission, etc.) You should have a try-catch block around Compress-Archive to account for this, and fail or proceed gracefully. Using ZipFileExtensions, an error created an unusable file until it was finalized. Compress-Archive may be more robust, but there are still chances for failure (try pulling your network cable while creating a large archive of files on your LAN). </p>

<p>4) There's no need for an intermediate folder, and it creates more opportunities for failure. You can just compress the file into the zip and delete on success. </p>

<p>5) The message 'No old files found' is misleading. Reading it, I would think that there were no files found matching the age criteria, when it really means the intermediate folder doesn't exist. </p>

<p>6) Don't you need a .Zip file name for the -DestinationPath? </p>

<p>7) <code>Write-Output</code> is usually used for return values rather than messages. Write-verbose, or Write-Host are more appropriate for status messages. </p>

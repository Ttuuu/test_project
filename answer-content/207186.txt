<p>Avoid premature optimizations, they're really hurting this code. </p>

<p>In the comments you defend the use of <code>goto</code> using the argument that it avoids branch prediction. </p>

<p>Accepting the dubious premise that the compiler produces more optimized code from a series of sequential <code>if</code> statements than it would from a conventional <code>if-else</code> construct, lets look at the context of that optimization to see what it might get you.</p>

<p>As other answers have pointed out, the data structure is poorly chosen, as the cost of a node allocation is going to dwarf the cost of a missed branch prediction. </p>

<p>Assuming you swap that out, as pointed out in another answer, you'll also want to grab multiple bytes at a time from the RNG. That'll help, but even fully optimized that call will cost more than you could possibly save using a questionable branch prediction optimization.</p>

<p>That final bit converting the characters to a string? Yep, that's a traversal so you're looking at one conditional per node, plenty of chances for a bad branch prediction. </p>

<p>The bottom line is that, by focusing on something which makes you feel like you're "thinking for yourself" and "questioning authority" <em>but doesn't actually help</em>, you've given away readability for no measurable benefit.</p>

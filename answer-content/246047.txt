<p>Lol you believe LeetCode's timing is proper? You're so cute.</p>
<p>If you actually want to see speed differences between those solutions, with LeetCode's test cases and on LeetCode, I suggest running the solution 100 times on each input:</p>
<pre><code>class Solution:
    
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -&gt; bool:        
        for _ in range(100):
            result = self.real_isPalindrome(x)
        return result
    
    def real_isPalindrome(self, x: int) -&gt; bool:        
        # Your real solution here
</code></pre>
<p>And then you should still submit several times and take the average or so, as times for the exact same code can differ a lot depending on server load.</p>
<p>I did that with your three solutions and the times were about 1200 ms, 4300 ms, and 2600 ms. Since that did 100 times the normal work, the actual times of the solutions were about 12 ms, 43 ms, and 26 ms. The difference between that and the time shown for a regular submission of a solution is the judge overhead, which LeetCode brilliantly includes in the time.</p>
<p>I also submitted your first solution normally a few times, got 60 ms to 72 ms. So if 100 runs of your solution take 1200 ms and one run takes 66 ms, then you have:</p>
<pre><code>JudgeOverhead + 100 * Solution = 1200 ms
JudgeOverhead + Solution = 66 ms

Subtract the second equation from the first:
=&gt; 99 * Solution = 1134 ms

Divide by 99:
=&gt; Solution = 11.45 ms

And:
=&gt; JudgeOverhead = 66 ms - 11.45 ms = 54.55 ms
</code></pre>
<p>Oh and the ordinary</p>
<pre><code>    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -&gt; bool:
        s = str(x)
        return s == s[::-1]
</code></pre>
<p>solution got about 420 ms with the 100-times trick. Subtract 55 ms judge overhead and divide by 100 and you're at 3.65 ms for the solution. So in that case, the judge overhead absolutely dwarfs the actual solution time, and together with the time variance, the shown time for a normal single-run submission is absolutely meaningless.</p>

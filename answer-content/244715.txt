<p>For an interview, this is bad code. It is <span class="math-container">\$O(n \log n)\$</span>. But it can be done in <span class="math-container">\$O(n)\$</span> time. Your code does not show your skills in that direction. Also, many interviewers (justifiably) will be unhappy for using streams. Streams may look cute but at scale like Gmail, they cause performance problems.</p>

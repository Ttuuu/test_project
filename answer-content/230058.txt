<p>Some suggestions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Boolean arguments are a code smell. Especially in a case like this you'd want to have separate <code>encrypt</code> and <code>decrypt</code> functions, which both reuse a third function which does all the bookkeeping. In this case the third function could just take the <code>FERNET.encrypt</code> or <code>FERNET.decrypt</code> method as an argument, and apply it to the data.</li>
<li>For this to be generally usable you'll want to add some argument parsing, possibly with <code>argparse</code>, to be able to pass an arbitrary path to work with.</li>
<li>The key should not be in code - it's just data, and should be stored in the original key format. If it's just a /dev/urandom dump with no structure to it that would be a .bin format, but I'm not familiar with Fernet. The code would normally be told about the key by passing a path argument or by passing the contents on standard input.</li>
</ol>

<p>Generally I wouldn't worry about encryption and decryption taking a long time. If your key is too long (algorithm-specific) it could slow down the algorithm considerably, but many algorithms can be considered quite slow with common inputs. I don't know why you chose Fernet specifically, but there are many algorithms available, and you might want to evaluate them for strength and speed.</p>

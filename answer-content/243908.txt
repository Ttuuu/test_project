<p>I discovered what I think is a flaw - in Flush() I call simply Flush() on the underlying stream, however I think this needs to be Flush(true) to ensure that all the changes are written before the log file is reset. I made the same change in Log.cs.</p>
<p>This means changing the type of BaseStream to FileStream, as Flush(true) is specific to FileStream.</p>
<p>The primitive I want is some kind of "fence" to say "write operations (all FileStreams) must not be re-ordered over this fence (either way)." However this doesn't seem to be available unless I have missed something - or perhaps plain Flush() has this effect, but if so, it doesn't seem to be documented.</p>

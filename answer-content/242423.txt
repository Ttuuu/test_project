<p>One of my favorite topics for code review and rants is the <code>&lt;ctype.h&gt;</code> header. It defines functions like <code>isalpha</code> that <em>sound</em> as if they would operate on characters (<code>char</code>), but they don't. They operate on numbers (<code>int</code>) instead, which is obviously confusing, but that's the way it is in C and C++.</p>

<p>The short answer is to never call <code>isalpha</code> with a <code>char</code> as argument. Always use an <code>unsigned char</code>, for example like this:</p>

<pre><code>if (isalpha((unsigned char) str[i])) {
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm pretty sure the js convention is still to prefix "private" stuff with an underscore.</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>class QuickSort {
  sort(a) {...}
  _sort(a, lo, hi) {...}
  ...}
</code></pre>
<p>The only other thing that sticks out to me is your use of <code>++</code> and <code>--</code> in the <code>while</code> loops. While perfectly idiomatic, I think it would express the logic better to move both conditionals together in the <code>while(condition)</code>, and the increment action into the <code>while</code>'s body. Of course it's always nice if one can abstract away a loop altogether...</p>
<p>Other people can speak more specifically about javascript than I can.</p>

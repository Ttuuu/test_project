<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>I would clean it up a bit:</p>

<pre><code>public static function slugCompany($company){
    $replace = [
        '/[^\da-z\s]/i'                        =&gt; '', //remove punctuation I guess
        '/\b('.self::COMPANY_STOPWORDS.')\b/i' =&gt; '', //remove these companies
         '/^\s+|\s+$/'                         =&gt; '', //trim
         '/\s+/'                               =&gt; '-' //replace space with -
    ];

    return preg_replace(array_keys($replace), $replace, strtolower($company));
}
</code></pre>

<p>I cleaned up all these local variables, got rid of a few repetitive calls.  The <code>array_keys</code> and array structure are mainly for readability reasons and ease of use.  For example now you can easly add replacements if you need to because they use a common array for the replacements.    </p>

<p>Its more of a readability fix as it's hard to know all the input you may have so I have to trust that you covered all the edge cases.</p>

<p>Hope it helps.</p>

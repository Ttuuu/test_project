<p>I see some things that may help you improve your program.  </p>

<h2>Use the appropriate <code>#include</code>s</h2>

<p>In order to compile and link, this code requires at least <code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</code>.  For the program to be complete, all appropriate <code>#include</code>s should be listed, too.</p>

<h2>Check your assumptions</h2>

<p>For this code to work, the <code>int</code> on your platform must be at least 32 bits.  For that reason, this assumption should be checked at compile time:</p>

<pre><code>static_assert(sizeof(int) &gt;= 4), "int must be at least 32 bits");
</code></pre>

<h2>Format your code consistently</h2>

<p>It doesn't matter as much what style you use as it matters that you have a consistent style. In particular, there seems to be inconsistent indenting and inconsistent placement of braces.  Using a consistent style helps readers of the code understand it.</p>

<h2>Use better variable names</h2>

<p>Generally, single letter variable names other than <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> for loop variables, are best avoided in favor of longer, more descriptive names.  The variable <code>p</code> is not too terrible, but the variable <code>l</code> is definitely a poor choice, not least because it's easily mistaken for the digit <code>1</code> or the letter <code>i</code>.  I changed it to <code>len</code> in the rewrite I did.</p>

<h2>Fix the bug</h2>

<p>Right now, if we have the program calculate <code>solution(8)</code>, it returns 1 instead of -1.  That is not correct.  There are other values within the range that also return incorrect values.</p>

<h2>Write a test program</h2>

<p>Right now the <code>main</code> routine just tries three values.  It would be better to try other values, maybe even every value in the range, and test it for accuracy.  You can do that by creating a function <code>bool verify(int n, int p)</code> that returns <code>true</code> if the condition stated at the beginning of the problem is true.</p>

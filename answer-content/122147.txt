<p>(2nd attempt.)</p>

<p>The most efficient data structure for this problem is as follows:
(1) basically, you create an array based list with
(2) field <code>size</code> which caches the amount of elements in the list,
(3) field <code>head</code> which is the index into the "first" element in the list.</p>

<p>Now, with minor bookkeeping you can "rotate" simply by assigning an appropriate value to the <code>head</code> field: runs in constant time and space.</p>

<pre><code>memcache.delete(filename)
</code></pre>

<p>and:</p>

<pre><code>user = memcache.get(filename)
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>It's not clear how the lock is released. It doesn't happen in <code>process</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The test <code>else: if fileExists:</code> seems backwards.</p></li>

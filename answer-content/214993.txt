<p>One easy change...</p>

<p>If you have <code>N</code> inequalities, you add up to <code>3N</code> test numbers to your set.</p>

<p>You only need <code>2N+1</code> test numbers:  say, <code>numPiece</code> and <code>numPiece+0.5</code> ... and say <code>-inf</code> for the last point.</p>

<hr>

<p>With <code>N</code> inequalities and <code>3N</code> test values, your algorithm is <span class="math-container">\$O(N^2)\$</span>.  </p>

<p>If you sorted your inequalities by <code>C</code> values, you could move over the inequalities in order, and keep a running total of passing inequalities, and recording the maximum, for an overall <span class="math-container">\$O(N \log N)\$</span> time complexity</p>

<p>I don't know where to begin... this would be very very long answer. Why would Library class inherit from Book or even Student? Library is not a Student. You should use students inside a library as a member field, or something, not inherit from it. I suggest you to start all over, and read some C++ concepts. This is not about file reading and writing, this is about code hierarchy and basic understanding of C++ (OOP) code and practices. Read about classes, inheritance, encapsulations and other concepts. Try following some tutorial. I know that this is not the answer you would want to hear, but maybe somebody will give you a better answer. Best regards and keep learning.</p>

<p>IMO the answer highly depends on how you are planning to extend the functionality of your class.
If its only <strong>function</strong> is fetching the username, it's probably better to transform it into a <strong>function</strong>. Class is an overkill.</p>

<p>A few thoughts if you're going to expand it:</p>

<ol>
<li>You can take a look at the <a href="https://api.stackexchange.com">Stack Exchange API</a> and see if it matches your needs if you haven't already.</li>
<li>You can cache user data in the class fields.</li>
<li>If you don't care too much about making one extra request, you can make one when you call <code>get_profile</code>. For this, you'll probably need to store the session credentials.</li>
<li>You can try using <code>HEAD</code> method instead of <code>GET</code> when you don't need the body (dunno though if the site will handle it as intended).</li>
</ol>

<p>Also, in Python 3 there is no reason to extend <code>object</code> for new classes.</p>

<p>Your code does not handle negative numbers.  As it is, it will print nothing.  The code should be changed to either handle the negatives properly, or take <code>number</code> as an unsigned where it is not an issue.</p>

<p>Your use of <code>base</code> as the length of the array to store the converted number in is incorrect.  A 32-bit integer will potentially need 32 characters to display the entire number, assuming no zero byte terminator (see below).  <code>buffer</code> should be declared as a fixed size, large enough to hold the longest possible string.  You could then eliminate the <code>i &lt; base</code> check from your <code>while</code> loop.</p>

<p>The initial check of <code>if (!number)</code> can be eliminated by changing your <code>while</code> loop into a <code>do</code>/<code>while</code> look.</p>

<p>If you're looking for brevity in code lines, the body of the loop can be reduced to two statements, although it is more readable with three or four.</p>

<p>The assignment of a 0 byte to the end of buffer is unnecessary in this context since you never pass <code>buffer</code> to a function that requires it.</p>

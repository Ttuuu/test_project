<p>A factor 4 for 3x3 is in the same order, and okay.</p>

<p>One could write could to generate a <code>Matrix99x99</code> C++ file, and test that.
My guess it would be factor 4 too. If it could be 2 then, and as such it would be totally fine.</p>

<p><em>A remark</em> Normal matrix multiplication A.B with A having dimensions LxM and B dimensions MxN, requiring a sÂ´hared M, resulting in a dimension LxN. So a small C++ class as such would be nice._</p>

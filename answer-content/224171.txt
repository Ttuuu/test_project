<p>I'm in a rush so this is half baked :(</p>

<ul>
<li>It's best if you provide everything, currently your code isn't PEP 8 compliant due to you removing the docstrings. Some people may moan at you for this.</li>
<li>You should prefer guard statements over <code>if</code> <code>else</code> statements when possible. You can easily change <code>if os.path.getsize(source_txt)</code> to use a <code>not</code> which would reduce the amount of indentation and reduce the complexity to read.</li>
<li>You seem to have half baked error handling and I wouldn't be surprised if you're duplicating errors you can get from <code>open</code> and <code>pathlib</code>.</li>
<li>I don't think you need a <code>Folder</code> class. If you use <code>pathlib</code> then everything you need should be fairly simple. I'm probably missing a couple of features but I think what you want is as simple as the below code.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>from pathlib import Path


def main(source, src, dst, extensions):
    src = Path(src)
    dst = Path(dst)
    with open(source) as folders:
        for folder_name in folders:
            for i, file in enumerate(
                file
                for file in (src / folder_name).iterdir()
                if file.suffix in extensions
            ):
                shutil.move(file,  dst / f'{folder_name}_{i}{file.suffix}')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        main(
            "source.txt",
            "{0}\\{1}".format(os.getenv("USERPROFILE"), "Pictures"),
            None,
            (".jpg",),
        )
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
        raise SystemExit(1) from None

<p>With regard to initialising <code>list</code> statically, <em>ISO/IEC 9899 6.6.9</em> says that an <em>address constant</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The array-subscript [] and member-access .
  and -&gt; operators, the address &amp; and indirection * unary operators, and pointer casts may
  be used in the creation of an address constant, but the value of an object shall not be
  accessed by use of these operators.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn't think this would work, but it does because it doesn't access the value,</p>

<pre><code>static struct List list = { { 0, &amp;list.tail }, { &amp;list.head, 0 } };
</code></pre>

<p>This eliminates the need to call <code>ListClear</code>. It is much easier then having two cases, empty and a non-empty list.</p>

<p>Your code looks fine and is short enough to be understood.</p>

<p>If you don't want to work on the level of individual characters, you can use regular expressions. Here is the code:</p>

<pre><code>public static int sumNumbers(String str) {
    Matcher m = Pattern.compile("[0-9]+").matcher(str);
    int sum = 0;
    while (m.find()) {
        sum += Integer.parseInt(m.group());
    }
    return sum;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is not the fastest code, but I find it easy to read once you know that <code>[0-9]</code> means <em>a digit</em>, and the <code>+</code> means <em>1 or more times</em>.</p>

<p>In general the template looks like a good start. I noticed that the code appears to resemble the format advised in <a href="https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PHP-Fig's PSR-2</a>, namely "<em>The opening brace MUST go on its own line</em>"<sup><a href="https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/#43-methods" rel="nofollow noreferrer">1</a></sup> for functions and methods plus control structures like <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> blocks. Most of the Javascript style guides I have seen call for curly braces to exist on the same line of the block they are opening. Personally I don't even agree with this in PHP, let alone Javascript, however if that is your personal preference then keep it consistent.</p>

<hr>

<p>Inside the <code>init</code> method, there is an iterator:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>return this.each(function(index)
{
    if(!$(this).hasClass("plugin_class"))
    {
        $(this).addClass("plugin_class");

       var $this = $(this);
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The reference <code>var $this = $(this);</code> could be stored before the check of the class name and/or class name addition in order to reduce DOM queries.</p>

<p>Also, the name <code>$this</code> could be more descriptive - at least something like <code>$element</code> or <code>$elem</code> (as shown in the example under <a href="https://learn.jquery.com/plugins/advanced-plugin-concepts/#provide-public-access-to-secondary-functions-as-applicable" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><em>Provide Public Access to Secondary Functions as Applicable</em></a> from the <a href="https://learn.jquery.com/plugins/advanced-plugin-concepts/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Advanced Plugin Concepts</a>).</p>

<h2>Addressing Your Additional question</h2>

<p>You asked in a comment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>what about the <code>$.fn[plugin]</code> part? I'm not sure about the first if statement. could that function be refactored and improved?</em></p>

<p>It is possible that <a href="/questions/tagged/ecmascript-6" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'ecmascript-6'" rel="tag">ecmascript-6</a> features like the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax" rel="nofollow noreferrer">spread syntax</a> could potentially be used to simplify the call, though given that <a href="https://jquery.com/browser-support/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">current jQuery browser support</a> includes IE 9+ it may not be wise to utilize ES-6 features.</p>

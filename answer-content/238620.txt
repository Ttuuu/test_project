<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>"<code>been occurred</code>" is grammatically incorrect, and I don't think this line makes any sense:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>if (ini_get('display_errors') || php_sapi_name() === 'cli')
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p><code>php_sapi_name()</code> will always return either a 1 or a 0, depending on what method the server is using to access the php script[internally]. It has nothing to do with client side whether you are in development or production..</p>

<p><code>ini_get()</code> will return a boolean value or an empty string, 
as stated in the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.php-sapi-name.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>php_sapi_name</code> manual</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A boolean ini value of off will be returned as an empty string or "0"
  while a boolean ini value of on will be returned as "1".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So your <code>if</code> statement is basically saying "if 0, 1 or an empty string, run the code below," which is useless. That has no logical use to error reporting.</p>

<p>What is the purpose of checking what type of interface the server is using to access PHP in this scenario?</p>

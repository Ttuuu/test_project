<p>It seems you are a beginner / hobbyist / learner.  This was not intended as an offense since we were all beginners once.</p>

<p>The biggest advice I could pass on is that you should separate the UI from the logic.  Anything with displaying output or requesting input is part of that UI.  The <code>Cinema</code> class should not be issuing <code>Console.WriteLine</code>.  Rather it could instead return a string and leave it up to the UI on what to do with that string.</p>

<p>@Flater had good points all around, particularly about having the Random instance be defined at the class level.  As for randomizing seats, I would treat all the seats like a deck of card.  I would randomly shuffle a deck once, and then deal each card as requested.  I would not randomly shuffle, deal one card, and then randomly shuffle again for the next card.  I suggest you look into the <strong>Fisher Yates Shuffle</strong> (several examples are here on CR).</p>

<p>The <code>Seat</code> class could become an immutable struct instead.  You may consider overriding <code>ToString</code> to print an "E" or "T" for empty or taken, or perhaps "O" and "X" for open and taken.</p>

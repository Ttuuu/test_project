<p>Your code is organized in a good way. Another thing I liked is that you have followed proper naming convention (i.e. Camel Case) while defining the function. However, there are few things that can be improved.</p>

<p>First of all, the code will give Compilation Error as the last <code>}</code> is missing in the code. Another thing is that, some imports like <code>regex</code> can be removed from the code as the functionality of those imports are never used in the code.</p>

<p>Another thing I have observed in your code that you are comparing both <code>ascii</code> values <code>comp</code> and <code>comp2</code> and then returning the boolean after competing the <code>for</code> loop. Instead of that, you can return the <code>false</code> as soon as both <code>ascii</code> numbers are not same. This means we do not need to iterate through the whole string if a single difference doesn't match.</p>

<p>Apart from that, you have developed a function <code>reverese</code> to reverse the string and return the reversed string to the <code>isFunny</code> function. This thing (of passing a big string to the function, then doing some operation on each character and getting back into original one) can increase the time complexity as the maximum length of the string in this case can be 10000 (from description).</p>

<p>Actually, there is no need to reverse the String as the main goal is to compare <code>ascii</code> values of each character of two strings. We can directly get the <code>ascii</code> value of each character of reversed string without reversing the original String. So, my logic is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>static boolean isFunny(String s) 
{
    int[] a1 = new int[s.length()];
    int[] a2 = new int[s.length()];
    int slen= s.length() - 1;

    for(int i = 0; i &lt; a1.length; i++, slen--)
    {
        a1[i] = s.charAt(i);
        a2[slen] = s.charAt(i);
    }

    for(int i = 0; i &lt; a1.length - 1; i++)
    {
        int diff1 = Math.abs(a1[i] - a1[i + 1]);
        int diff2 = Math.abs(a2[i] - a2[i + 1]);

        if(diff1 != diff2)
        {
            return false;
        }
    }

    return true;
}

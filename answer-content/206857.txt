<p>Instead of looping over the <code>freq.keySet</code>, I recommend using <code>freq.forEach((k, v) -&gt; bucket[v].add(k))</code>. This avoids the map lookups. In your current code, for each key you do a search in the map, which takes time. By using <code>forEach</code>, this additional search is avoided.</p>

<p>Do you actually have any performance requirements? If not, I'd say the code is perfect. It is easy to read and understand, and well documented.</p>

<p>Your code might return more than the k elements that are requested, because of the <code>addAll</code>. This should be discussed with the interviewer whether it is ok.</p>

<p>Too bad that Java doesn't have a built-in Histogram class. Things would have been much simpler that way:</p>

<pre><code>new Histogram(nums).stream()
    .limit(k)
    .forEach(System.out::println);
</code></pre>

<p>On the assumption that <code>dict.txt</code> isn't changing, I don't see a reason to keep this in the loop. Disk caching means that it might not have <em>too</em> bad a performance hit nowadays, but it's still not a good idea to do an expensive operation multiple times if you can store the result.</p>

<pre><code>                .map { Pair(it, it.toCharArray().sorted()) }
                .filter { it.second == sortedWordChar }
                .forEach { print("${it.first} ") }
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Since you don't need <code>it.second</code> past the filter, it would be simpler to write</p>

<pre><code>                 .filter { it.toCharArray().sorted() == sortedWordChar }
                 .forEach { print("${it} ") }
</code></pre>

<p>On style, I'm not sure what's going on with the indentation. In particular,</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>        val sortedWordChar =
                word
                        .toCharArray()
                        .sorted()
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>looks weird to me. If it's necessary to split into multiple lines (which I'm not convinced of, given that essentially the same expression is on a single line in the <code>map</code>), wouldn't one tab be sufficient indentation rather than two?</p>

<p>right now I can only see one thing that I might do differently, but it only shortens the code block a bit.</p>

<p>I might return the second statement, it removes an assignment to the variable, I don't like adding extra steps I don't have to.</p>

<p>I would also remove those Comments because they are not useful to me.<sub>I realize that the urls are just for example</sub></p>

<p>the reason I say they are not useful to me is because you have written good code here, it describes what it is doing to the point that if I had never looked at the code before (or haven't looked at it in years) I would still know what it is doing without the comments.</p>

<hr>

<p>because it was in my head just now, and not because it is good coding practice, you could one-line this return statement and never actually assign to the input parameter.</p>

<pre><code>protected string formatCSVCell(string text)
{
   var doubleQuote = "\"";

   return $"{doubleQuote}{text.Replace($"{doubleQuote}", $"{doubleQuote}{doubleQuote}")}{doubleQuote}";
}
</code></pre>

<p>Actually, that doesn't look <em>as bad</em> as I thought it was going to.  Please keep in mind that I have not tested this One Liner.</p>

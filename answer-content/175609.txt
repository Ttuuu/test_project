  <p>However, I am not sure if this is good practice, or if it should be avoided.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I don't think it is <em>bad practice</em>, it could be simplified. One technique to simplify it is using <a href="https://davidwalsh.name/event-delegate" rel="nofollow noreferrer">event delegation</a>. </p>

<p>For example, the array of tab options could be added to a JavaScript array:</p>

<pre><code>$tab_options = array('home', 'profile', 'news', 'api');
echo 'var tab_options = '.json_encode($tab_options).';';
</code></pre>

<p>Then add a click handler to the document and check if the <em>id</em> attribute corresponds to one of those tab options. </p>

<pre><code>$(document).click(function(clickEvent) {
    var targetId = clickEvent.target.id;
    if (tab_options.indexOf(targetId) &gt; -1) {
</code></pre>

<p>In that code <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Array.indexOf()</a> is used but one could also use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/contains" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Array.contains()</a> though it isn't supported by as many (mostly older) browsers (e.g. IE).</p>

<p>Then to get the equivalent of <a href="http://php.net/ucwords" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ucwords()</a>, a solution like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/5122461/1575353">from this answer</a> can be used:</p>

<pre><code>var properCaseOption = targetId.replace(/\b[a-z]/g, function(letter) {
    return letter.toUpperCase();
});                    
window.top.document.title = properCaseOption;
</code></pre>

<p>With this approach, the JavaScript code is not duplicated once for each tab option. Perhaps it may not be a big issue because that code could easily be updated with the PHP code, it would yield a larger HTML/JS page size.</p>

<p>See a demonstration of this <a href="https://www.tehplayground.com/NFabrSuwHKFF61XI" rel="nofollow noreferrer">in this playground example</a> but note that the AJAX requests won't yield the pages as expected so the code to update the containers has been commented out. However I made a <a href="http://phpfiddle.org/main/code/sb4q-3wz6" rel="nofollow noreferrer">phpfiddle</a> that has the response from the AJAX request utilized.</p>

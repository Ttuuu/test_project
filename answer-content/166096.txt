<p>The third <code>for</code> loop can be replaced with a single <code>return True</code> statement (because it's the exact opposite of the second <code>for</code>). Also, the <code>else:</code> can be removed as if any previous conditions were satisfied, the function would have already returned. The <code>return True</code> block formerly in the <code>else:</code> block can be fused with the third <code>for</code> loop's <code>return</code>, producing this code:</p>

<pre><code>def is_prime(x):
    list_n = range(2,x)

    if x &lt;= 1:
        return False
    elif x-1 &gt; 2:
        for n in range(len(list_n)):
            list_n[n] = x % list_n[n]
        for n in list_n:
            if n == 0:
                return False
    return True
</code></pre>

<p>Another suggestion is to replace the first <code>for</code> with a list comprehension. This is left as an exercise to the reader.</p>

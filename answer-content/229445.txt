<h3>Document everything</h3>

<p>You will now be on the hook to maintain this code (which is fine).  So, document everything very well.  What does <code>scan1_location</code> mean and why is it equal to <code>6</code>, but <code>scan2_location = 3</code>.  Will you remember why a year from now when your friend asks you to update the code to handle a new kind of line, or when one of the line format changes?</p>

<p>Include a top level docstring explaining what the file does any why. Include a sample of every kind of line.</p>

<h3>proper command line program</h3>

<p>It looks like this is to be a command line program.  So make it a proper command line program.  Take a look at the 'click' library.  At a minimum, it should have a way to get help with proper usage of the program.  I would add a way to turn on logging, to help with tracking down the inevitable bug.</p>

<h3>separate output directory</h3>

<p>Presumably, the account numbers are being masked in the files, so the files can be seen or used by people that aren't allowed to see the account numbers.  Intermixing the masked and unmasked files in the same directory is asking for someone to accidentally send a wrong file.  </p>

<h3><code>open()</code> can be used as a context manager</h3>

<p>It looks like <code>output.close()</code> if misplaced.  A new output file is opened whenever a new input filed is opened, and they should probably be closed be together too.  The easiest way to ensure files are closed when you are done with them is to use a <code>with</code> statement:</p>

<pre><code>with open(...) as input_file, open(...) as output_file:

    ... process the files in this block of code ...

... the files automatically get closed here ...
</code></pre>

<h3>open files are iterable</h3>

<p>To iterate over the lines in a file use:</p>

<pre><code>for line in input_file:
    ... process the lines ...
</code></pre>

<h3>str.find(substring, start, end)</h3>

<p>start and end default to 0 and the length of the string, so it is not necessary to provide them.</p>

<p>That's all for now.</p>

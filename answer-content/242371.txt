<ol>
<li>In quicksort, when you are sorting from elements 20 to 40, and the split becomes 30, the recursive calls should be to sort 20 to 29 and 31 to 40.  You did 0 to 29 and 31 to max.  I suspect this made your code degenerate into an <span class="math-container">\$O(n^2)\$</span> sort (but still work).</li>
<li>In quicksort, you should not pass in a pivot.  The function should work that out itself.</li>
<li>Variable bos is a problem.  You only ever use bos[0], so you shouldn't even make an array, just a simple variable.</li>

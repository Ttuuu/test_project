<p>The <code>[..]</code> slicing operation isn't going to cost anything, but isn't very descriptive either. I'd want to call <code>s.style.as_str()</code> instead.</p>
<p>As for the return type, I'd agree that <code>&amp;str</code> is more appropriate, since it is the more general type. The functionality of a <code>String</code> is a superset of what you can do with a <code>str</code>, so it's irrelevant when that extra functionality isn't useful to the caller</p>

<p>This answer may come across as harsh, but it is not supposed to be.</p>
<p>Your code looks good, BUT it lacks any comments so it’s quite difficult for other people to understand what it’s purpose is.  I have no doubt that today you know what your code does, but if you are working in a professional capacity in three months time when you have written another several thousand lines you won’t remember.</p>
<p>You have used base classes, but we can’t see them, this means we have even less understanding of the code.</p>
<p>Your coding styles are nice and clean, but you need to decide which one to use for instance you’ve got camel case and underscores in variable names.</p>
<p>It’s possible that things are being done in the base classes that I can’t see, but you seem to be dereferencing pointers without verifying they are not null.  See *pData, which isn’t initialised.</p>
<p>And a really minor thing length could be a const variable.</p>
<p>You say you want to optimise the code.  What problems are there with it?  Have you benchmarked it’s current performance, where is most of the time spent?</p>

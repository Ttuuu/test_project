<p>I recommend against writing comments on your regular expressions like that, for several reasons.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Readability:</strong> Just the act of splitting up the string makes it harder to read.  Compactness is also a virtue.  Regular expressions are punctuation-heavy enough to begin with; the extra <code>"</code> and <code>+</code> symbols make things worse.</li>
<li><strong>Redundancy:</strong> You're stating the same thing twice on every line.  To anyone who understands regular expressions, you've just made the code more verbose.</li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of insight:</strong> Comments that describe <em>why</em> are more valuable than comments that describe <em>what</em>.  A comment like this would be more helpful:</p>

<pre><code>String regexStr =
    "\\b" +
    "\\d{3}" +   // 3-digit area code
    â€¦
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>What would be most beneficial, I think, is just one comment that describes the intention of the entire regular expression, and a self-documenting variable name.</p>

<pre><code>// A 10-digit phone number, optionally delimited into groups of 3, 3, 4 digits
// by hyphens or dots.  We also check for word boundaries before and after.
Pattern phonePattern = Pattern.compile("\\b\\d{3}[-.]?\\d{3}[-.]?\\d{4}\\b");
</code></pre>

<p>I think that this comment is at least as informative as your original, without suffering from the disadvantages I mentioned.  With that description, even a complete novice to regular expressions should be able to figure out what each part of the regex does.</p>

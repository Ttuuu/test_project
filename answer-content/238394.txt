<p>First off, I semantically disagree about <code>$medical &amp;&amp; $medical-&gt;getMedCon())</code>. Second I think that piece of code is worth wrapping up into a small method/function. To accomplish this, I'd go for:</p>

<pre><code>private function hasMedical(SomeEntity $v): bool {
    if ($v-&gt;getMedical() === null) {
        return false;
    }
    return $v-&gt;getMedical()-&gt;getMedCon()
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, there is some kind of smell over there that you need to check the null alongside with the bool value. 
Probably you could more cleanly implement it with annotations, mappings, etc.</p>

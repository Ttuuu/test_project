<p>The <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/232910/92478">other</a> <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/232913/92478">answers</a> have great hints that you should definitely follow.</p>

<p>However, since we are talking about passwords here, a little bit of extra security might not hurt. Especially if it's readily available in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>secrets</code></a> module in Python 3. <code>secrets</code> uses a cryptograhically strong random number generator (in contrast to the <em>pseudo</em> random number generator in the normal <code>random</code> module). There is a special warning in that regard in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs of random</a>. If you want to stick to <code>random</code>, at least use an instance of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.SystemRandom" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>random.SystemRandom()</code></a>, which is basically what <code>secrets</code> does. An example:</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>RNG = random.SystemRandom()

def password_generator(...):
    ...
    # The remaining values to fill
    type_ = list(types.keys())
    for rem in range(length - num_chars):
        char_list.append(RNG.choice(type_))
        # alternatively
        char_list.append(secrets.choice(type_))
    ...
</code></pre>

<p><code>random.choice</code> uses what is called a pseudo-random number generator, i.e. an algorithm that generates a deterministic "randomly looking" sequence of bytes starting from a given seed. <code>secrets.choice</code> uses a randomness source implemented in the OS, which likely takes electrical noise and other things into consideration to generate non-deterministic random data. random.org has a comprehensive article on the differences at <a href="https://www.random.org/randomness/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.random.org/randomness/</a>. And of course, there is also the obligatory Wikipedia page about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Randomness</a>.</p>

<p>I agree with @Matt-Cole here. This seems pretty complicated to solve a WYSIWYG output problem. I would make sure this is the right solution to the problem and the one that adds the least amount of complexity to your system.</p>

<p>I don't know which WYSIWYG editor/system is being used. But, if you have access to it you might want to look into solving it there. This posts has <a href="https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/53904/whats-the-best-way-to-present-variables-in-a-wysiwyg-editor"> variable representation suggestions for WYSIWYG editors</a>. Most common seems to be to using double brackets like <code>[[FIRST_NAME]]</code> or <code>{{FIRST_NAME}}</code>.</p>

<p>If you absolutely must solve the problem by modifying the string then use @Matt-Cole's code to write your solution. Though I don't feel comfortable to set max iteration to 500 not knowing the bounds of the string.</p>

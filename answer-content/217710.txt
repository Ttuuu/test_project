<p>Since <code>cisc/1</code> is unused by your current code, you should either delete the definitions or check in <code>prereq</code> that the given course numbers are indeed CISC courses.</p>

<p>I wonder how long your code takes to find the prerequisites in the following pathological case, and whether it reports any duplicates.</p>

<ul>
<li>There is a course graph with 20 levels.</li>
<li>At each level there is an A and a B course.</li>
<li>Each course on a level prerequires both the A and B courses of the previous levels.</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that there are <span class="math-container">\$2^\text{levels}\$</span> possible paths in the graph. Visiting them all would take a considerable amount of time.</p>

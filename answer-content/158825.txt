<h3>Bug</h3>

<p>What will be the value of <code>merge_step([array], [array], result)</code>? Nothing.
The solution will be incorrect for 0 and 1.</p>

<h3>Algorithm</h3>

<p>Converting an integer to binary string, and then converting that to a list of integers (zeros and ones), and then slicing dicing lists is very inefficient.</p>

<p>A much more simple and efficient approach is to count the sequences of unset bits:</p>

<pre><code>longest = 0
current_len = 0

while num &gt; 0:
    if num &amp; 1:
        if current_len &gt; longest:
            longest = current_len
        current_len = 0
    else:
        current_len += 1
    num &gt;&gt;= 1

return longest
</code></pre>

<p>The reason why the time complexity of this is \$O(\log n)\$ is that we're counting <em>bits</em>, which grows much slower than the value of \$n\$.</p>

<h3>Doctests</h3>

<p>As I pointed out in the <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/158819/12390">previous review</a>, I strongly recommend to use doctests to verify your implementation.</p>

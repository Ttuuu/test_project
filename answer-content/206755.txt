<p>Your code is missing the headers you need - at least <code>&lt;fstream&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;iostream&gt;</code>.  It also seems that there's a <code>using namespace std;</code> lurking somewhere; that's a bad practice that can subtly break your code, so I recommend that you explicitly qualify the names you use from it (<code>std</code> is intentionally a very short name, to save typing).</p>

<p>In C++, we can declare <code>int main()</code> - that's a prototype, unlike in C, where we need to write <code>int main(void)</code>.  The latter is certainly foreign-looking in C++.</p>

<p>It's probably clearer to return early if the file opening failed:</p>

<pre><code>if (!myFile) {
    std::cerr &lt;&lt; "Couldn't open input file";
    return 1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm a little uncomfortable with the compiled-in filename to read from - this makes the program quite inflexible.  Either provide the name as a command-line argument, or simply read from standard input so the program can read from any file or from a pipeline.</p>

<p>There's little point closing the input stream if we ignore the result - the stream's destructor will do that for us, so just let it go out of scope.</p>

<p>Be warned that <code>std::endl</code> includes a flush of the output stream - it's better to just write <code>'\n'</code> as line terminator (the stream will be flushed at program exit).</p>

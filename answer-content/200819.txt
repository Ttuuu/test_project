<p>String manipulation can be slow.  Inserting and deleting characters requires shifting characters in memory, if modifying in place, or allocating and freeing temporaries. </p>

<p>It could be faster to allocate one destination character buffer (<code>char[]</code> or <code>wchar_t[]</code>), and copy characters into it, performing the translations as required, and then converting into a <code>std::string</code> at the end.</p>

<p>The destination buffer would need space for <code>str.length() + std::count(str.begin(), str.end(), '$')</code> characters, since <code>$9</code> can become <code>$10</code>, etc. </p>

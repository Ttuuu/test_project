<h3>Bugs and problems:</h3>

<ul>
<li><code>input.Remove(start, 4)</code> will throw an exception if <code>start</code> is less than 0, which happens when <code>input.Length</code> is less than 4. You should check for that, or otherwise catch exceptions at that point. This output path logic also seems to be written with very specific inputs in mind - it looks fairly brittle.</li>
<li>Similarly, <code>args[1]</code> will fail if <code>args.Length</code> is less than 2, but you've only made sure that <code>args.Length</code> isn't 0, so this will throw if only one argument is provided. This too will cause a crash because you're not catching exceptions here.</li>
<li>Always check for <code>null</code> whenever you use <code>as</code>. You're not doing that with <code>btObject</code> and <code>btMessages</code>, so using them might result in <code>NullReferenceExceptions</code>.</li>
<li>The final <code>for</code> and <code>foreach</code> loop both seem to do the exact same thing, just in a slightly different way, so one of them can probably be removed. Since <code>ExportSuccess</code> is always true, the <code>for</code> loop is never executed anyway. Either way, both loops always get the same message (index or id 1), which is probably not correct.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Readability:</h3>

<ul>
<li>There are a lot of unnecessary comments. Things like 'delare a TypeName variable' aren't useful, and there are better ways to get an overview of what code is doing than using 'shouty' headers. Try using comments to explain <em>why</em> code does what it does - <em>what</em> it's doing should be obvious by looking at the code itself.</li>
<li>As Andy already mentioned, try splitting your Main method up into several methods, each with a specific purpose. <code>GetApplication</code>, <code>GetInputOutputPaths</code>, <code>ExportCodeTemplate</code> and <code>ShowErrorMessages</code> seems like a reasonable way to do it. This keeps <code>Main</code> short and simple, and quickly gives you a high-level overview of what the application is actually doing - without needing any comments.</li>
<li>Why are all variables declared up-front? I'd move them as close to where each variable is actually used. Preferably in as small a scope as possible, and immediately initialized whenever possible. That keeps related things together, which should make the code easier to understand.</li>
<li>There's a <code>catch</code> statement body with several statements, including a <code>return</code>, all on a single line. That sort of inconsistencies makes code more difficult to read. Put each of those statements on a separate line.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other notes:</h3>

<ul>
<li><code>btMessageText</code> is not used anywhere. In any case, successive concatenation of strings is more efficiently done by appending to a <code>StringBuilder</code>.</li>
<li>Things like <code>variable1 + "small string" + variable2</code> can be written more succinctly with interpolated strings: <code>$"{variable1}small string{variable2}"</code>.</li>
<li><code>variable == false</code>, where <code>variable</code> is a boolean instead of a nullable boolean, is normally written as <code>!variable</code>.</li>
<li>Try using more descriptive names. <code>input</code> and <code>output</code> are ok, but <code>inputFilePath</code> and <code>outputFilePath</code> are better. <code>obj</code> and <code>btObject</code> are poor names - <code>messages</code> (or even <code>exportErrorMessages</code>) and <code>application</code> are better. In most cases there is no need to abbreviate things (<code>printerCodeTemplate</code> instead of <code>PCT</code>), and the <code>bt</code> prefix doesn't add any real value and is easily confused with <code>button</code>, as Andy already pointed out.</li>
<li><code>btPCT</code> isn't necessary: you can call <code>btFormat.PrinterCodeTemplate.Export(...)</code> directly.</li>
<li>I'd use <code>using System.Runtime.InteropServices</code> instead of writing <code>Marshal</code>'s name out full.</li>
<li>Why is that password hardcoded instead of passed in as an argument or via user input?</li>
<li>Why is only one part of the code inside a try-catch statement?</li>
<li>Personally I would make a lot more use of C#'s type inference (<code>var</code>), especially because in most assignments the type is obvious from both the left and right-hand side.</li>
</ul>

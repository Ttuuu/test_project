<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>As i got -1 already and it still will hit my stats will post answer that worked for me:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT L1.category_id AS step1, L2.category_id AS step2, L3.category_id AS step3 , L1.title AS title1, L2.title AS title2, L3.title AS title3

FROM nordigen_category AS L1

LEFT JOIN nordigen_category AS L2
ON L2.category_id=L1.parent_id

LEFT JOIN nordigen_category AS L3
ON L2.parent_id=L3.category_id

WHERE L1.category_id='84'
</code></pre>

<p>Less code and does what i want on every LVL.</p>

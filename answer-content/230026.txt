<p>It's been touched on (e.g. fixed in Peter's example) but not explicitly stated by anyone - but to me, the most obvious issue is in the duplication of code.</p>

<p>You have the following <code>if</code> statement:</p>

<pre><code>if(has_special_characters)
{
  //codeblock 1
}
else
{
  //codeblock 2
}
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>codeblock 1</code> and <code>codeblock 2</code> are almost exactly identical.  In fact it seems that the only difference is that you have this line in <code>codeblock 1</code>:</p>

<pre><code>strcat(to_be_used, special_characters);
</code></pre>

<p>You can completely remove the duplication of code and wrap only that line in an <code>if</code> block.</p>

<p>Although, I'd also suggest using Peter's second point, and not using strcat at all.  You can put all the characters into one string from the start and use the <code>if</code> to determine the range which you will cover:</p>

<pre><code>//adjacent strings are concatenated by the compiler
const char* characters = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
                         "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
                         "0123456789"
                         "!\"#$%&amp;'()*+,-./:;&lt;=&gt;?@[\\]^_`{|}~";
const unsigned int alphanumerics_len = 62;
const unsigned int all_character_len = 96;

int char_range_max;
if (has_special_characters)
{
  char_range_max = all_character_len;
} 
else
{
  char_range_max = alphanumerics_len;
}

//...intermediate code

const int random_index = random() % char_range_max;

//...more code

</code></pre>

<p>We can then improve upon this further by having the compiler handle the string lengths for us with a little pre-processor use to prevent anything needing repeating:</p>

<pre><code>#define AN "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"\
           "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"\
           "0123456789"
#define SP "!\"#$%&amp;'()*+,-./:;&lt;=&gt;?@[\\]^_`{|}~"
const int alphanumerics_len = sizeof (AN);
const int all_character_len = sizeof (AN SP);
const char* characters = AN SP;
</code></pre>

<p>I'd personally also prefer to replace the verbose if-block with the more concise:</p>

<pre><code>const int char_range_max = has_special_characters ? all_character_len : alphanumerics_len;
</code></pre>

<p>which also has the advantage that it can be defined as const too.</p>

<p>Few things I would bring your attention to:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>naming</em>. It is recommended by the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP8 styleguide</a> and generally agreed to follow the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>lower_case_with_underscores</code> variable and function naming style</a>. You have violated it on multiple occasions - e.g. <code>mainFrame</code>, <code>curFilePath</code>, <code>curFileCont</code> etc.</li>
<li><em>comments are over-used</em>. <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/coding-without-comments/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Code without comments</a> might feel like an extreme and somewhat opinion-based, but it is generally a great way of thinking about self-documented code. Just to highlight a few spots - I don't see the usefulness of <code>#path of the current file</code> before the <code>self.curFilePath = ''</code> line - especially if you would name a variable <code>current_file_path</code>. And, you can and should convert some of the comments into proper <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Documentation Strings</a></li>
<li><em>code repetition</em>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Don't repeat yourself</a>. Think of <a href="https://refactoring.com/catalog/extractMethod.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">extracting a method</a> out of the <code>save_before_leave()</code> method - look how the bodies of the two <code>if</code> blocks are identical to each other</li>
</ul>

<p>On this line:</p>

<pre><code>return(siren_pos, nic_pos, variable_pos)
</code></pre>

<p>you do not need to surround the return values in parens. They will be returned as a tuple anyway.</p>

<p>It seems ill-advised to iterate through the entire file just to count the number of lines. I advise incrementing <code>size</code> as you go along, so that you only have to iterate once.</p>

<p>You have a bunch of common code that applies to both files. I recommend writing function that does the <code>open()</code>, the <code>csv.reader()</code>, and the <code>set_up_file()</code>.</p>

<p>A very short review, as I don't have the time for a more extensive one.</p>

<h1>Enumerate</h1>

<p>Some things I see right off the bat is <code>range(len())</code>. Instead of writing this, consider using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>enumerate</code></a>. This will allow you to work with any iterable, not just countable, indexable objects.</p>

<h1>Unnecessary <code>else</code></h1>

<p>I see this piece of code next:</p>

<pre><code>if needle_output == None:
    return needle_alignment_result = needle_output
else:
    ... code here ...
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>else</code> here is unnecessary, as you exit the function after returning in the <code>if</code>. Just move the code in the <code>else</code> right after the <code>if</code>, and remove the unnecessary <code>else</code>, like so:</p>

<pre><code>if needle_output == None:
    return needle_alignment_result = needle_output
... code here ...
</code></pre>

<h1><code>is None</code> vs <code>== None</code></h1>

<p>Below is from an amazing <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/3257957/8968906">StackOverflow answer</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A class is free to implement
  comparison any way it chooses, and it
  can choose to make comparison against
  None means something (which actually
  makes sense; if someone told you to
  implement the None object from
  scratch, how else would you get it to
  compare True against itself?).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Practically-speaking, there is not much difference since custom comparison operators are rare.  But you should use <code>is None</code> as a general rule.</p>

<h2>TestLetter should accept a char instead of a String</h2>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>void testLetter(String a) {
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>You really want to test if a single character is inside the search word, than a full blown string. Testing if a single character is inside a string can be done with <code>indexOf</code>, and then comparing if its larger or equals to 0</p>

<pre><code>void testLetter(char a) {
</code></pre>

<h2>Weird variable naming</h2>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>StringBuilder wordsGuessedCorrectly
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This should actually be called <code>charsGuessedCorrectly</code>, because it contains a list of characters the user already used. Even better would be changing the type to a <code>Set&lt;Character&gt;</code> so you can directly use its contains method without turning the whole object to a string.</p>

<h2>Don't call <code>setVisible</code> from the constructor</h2>

<p>Calling <code>setVisible</code> fro the constructor makes extending your class hard, because any exception thrown from within a sub classes constructor will mean the object is left in a inconsistent state. Better would be removing this line form the constructor and adding it to the main method.</p>

<li><p>First, pull the <em>Regex</em> out of the function. Another thing would be to change it to <code>/\W|\_/g</code> because in case you missed one of the characters in your long list of non-word characters.</p></li>
<li><p>You are wasting a lot of time. You loop through once to remove all non-word characters, then once to split, then another to reverse, then another to join, then two more for each lowercase, and then loop through to check to see if they are the same...</p></li>

<li><p>Throw an error because a full string is still evaluated as true in <em>JavaScript</em>. But, in my opinion do not slow down your code to account for incorrect use. That way the people who know what they are doing won't be slowed down to check if it is a string. That way if someone wraps your library they can make the check if they want to:)</p></li>
<li><p>If it's empty then it is palindrome in my opinion. Other than that, I don't see any big ones.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, this is usually called an assert. When doing small tests like you are doing it is fine to create a small one. I prefer modularity when building software. (As I said down in the comments) If all I want is a feather do not give me the whole bird. A lot of libraries out there for <em>JavaScript</em> are like that. Even the sacred <em>jQuery</em> does this, when all I want is to send an <em>AJAX</em> request I have to bring in this huge library. To me it's slow and bulky, so when I make software I make a small piece to handle one thing and optimize it to do that one thing. But, if you are looking for a common library used to handle unit testing at a industry level <em><a href="https://qunitjs.com/" rel="nofollow">QUnit</a></em> does a very good job but just brings the whole bird.</p></li>
<li><p>The code I provided should help...</p></li>

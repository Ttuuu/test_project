<p>This code reads like beginner code. Good beginner code, but there are a few habits you're getting into that are systemic among beginners and <strong>will</strong> screw you over later down the line.</p>

<p>First, your function names are somewhat confusing. I would rename <code>pickRando</code> to <code>computerChoice</code>, <code>combatCheck</code> to <code>game</code>, and <code>finish</code> to something like <code>printRecord</code>. Once you do that, you shouldn't need the comments describing them. Comments are good, but shouldn't be used in lieu of descriptive names.</p>

<p>Second, avoid global variables. It will cause confusing issues later down the line, so please get into the habit of not using them. In order to avoid the global variables <code>wins</code>, <code>losses</code>, and <code>ties</code>, you would need to restructure a lot of code and it may not be worth it for this small of a code base. Exercise to the reader, I guess. But the other globals can easily be removed. I would change <code>pickRando</code> to</p>

<pre><code>def computerChoice():
    return random.choice(options)
</code></pre>

<p>The concept behind the input check is good, but I would heavily modify the structure. Here's a better way to do that</p>

<pre><code>while True:
    [...]
    print("Rock, Paper, Scissors:")

    playerChoice = input('choose wisely')
    while  not playerChoice in options:
        print "invalid input"
        playerChoice == input('choose wisely')
    print("Okay, you picked " + playerChoice + ' and I picked ' + computerChoice + '!')
</code></pre>

<p>This restructuring should make what it's actually doing clearer.</p>

<p>Next: the <code>convertible</code> method is a very good solution if you don't know about the built-in method <code>index</code>. You can change the <code>combatCheck</code> method to something like this.</p>

<pre><code>a = options.index(a)
b = options.index(b)
return (a-b) % 3
</code></pre>

<p>I would also comment the last line with something more descriptive than <code>modmath</code>. I might say something like <code>uses modular arithmetic to calculate results</code>.</p>

<p>I like that you put <code>combatCheck</code> in its own function from the perspective of the teacher, because it shows that you use functions, but I think it's unnecessary here, because you only use that bit of code once and it's only a few lines.</p>

<p>You definitely have some really great foundations. Most of your mistakes are mistakes I made in my early days of Python, and I like to think I'm a pretty OK programmer. I think with practice and time, you'll turn into an amazing programmer.</p>

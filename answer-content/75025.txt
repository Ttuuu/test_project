<p>If I remember correctly, I answered a similar question yesterday
<a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/74981/finding-the-given-word-from-jumbled-letters/74983#74983">Finding the given word from jumbled letters</a></p>

<p>Basically, doing permutations is going to take too long: a double <code>for</code> loop results in a complexity of \$O(nÂ²)\$.</p>

<p>As suggested in the link, use sorting and scan linear if the output is correct or use the second approach described by thepace, which runs in \$O(n)\$</p>

<p>Perhaps you could run through the word file and try each word with one of the above approaches. (I believe this will run faster)     </p>

<p>Regarding to your python code, may I suggest to use a main() function (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4041238/why-use-def-main">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4041238/why-use-def-main</a>) and call it by using:</p>

<pre><code>if __name__ == "__main__":
   main()
</code></pre>

<p>This is a common convention and splits your main code and your other functions in a clear way. It also prevents the code being run while it's included as a module.</p>

<p>goodluck!</p>

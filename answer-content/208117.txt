<p>The problem is that you're running against the limitations of Razor here. Ideally you'd have a function that loops though the various options -- add, update, delete -- and for each generates a relevant <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> and its accompanying <code>&lt;td&gt;</code>s based on the claims <code>User</code> has the rights to. </p>

<p>I'm guessing that's possible in Razor, but I fear you'd end up with a significant amount of methods that all call each other -- e.g. a function to create a <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> block that calls a function to create a <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> line, etc. -- which wouldn't exactly make things clearer.</p>

<p>Would it be possible for you to go full ASP.NET Core MVC? That way you can have such code in classes, have extension methods for <code>User</code>, etc. I did so in a recent project and it works like a charm, while still being easy to maintain.</p>

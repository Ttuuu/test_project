<h2>Pi</h2>
<p>There are some dissenting opinions on this, but: most compilers offer an <code>M_PI</code> if they are configured to do so. I prefer to do that rather than defining my own.</p>
<h2>Implicit return types</h2>
<p>Leaving these return types implicit:</p>
<pre><code>load(); //Function Prototype
Exit_0(); //Function Prototype
main() {
</code></pre>
<p>is not great. <code>main</code> should be <code>int main</code>. <code>Exit_0</code> should be <code>void</code>. <code>load</code> seems to be missing and should be deleted.</p>
<h2>Monster functions</h2>
<p>You need to expend a significant amount of effort into dividing the bulk of your code up into subroutines. As it stands, it's difficult to read and maintain.</p>
<p>While doing this refactoring, keep in mind that your <code>goto</code> will likely be able to be replaced with a <code>return</code> once this is done. <code>goto</code> should be avoided.</p>
<h2>Predeclaration of variables</h2>
<p>You should use (at least) C99, which obviates the need for these:</p>
<pre><code>char Opt, oper, H;
int i = 1, Oof, Check, N, K, Numbering, F, Choice, a, b, c, d;
float Num1, Num2, ans, CheckF, A, B, C, A1, A2, Z;
double x, xy, y;
</code></pre>
<p>to be declared at the beginning of the function. Declare them where they're used. Also, make an attempt to avoid single-letter variable names unless it's crystal clear what they do (it isn't here).</p>
<h2>Why sleep?</h2>
<pre><code>    Sleep(75);
</code></pre>
<p>There is no advantage to doing this; it just slows down the program and may frustrate the user.</p>

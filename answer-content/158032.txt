<p>Well, this is slightly embarrassing as it seems that I hadn't collected all relevant information first - but it might benefit others to know (which is partly why I'm posting this as an answer). </p>

<p>In my example above, when using <code>rAF</code> I'm adding a class to the element and handling the "animation" through css <code>transition</code>. However, what I didn't know is that apparently requestAnimationFrame doesn't do anything beneficial for css animations - at least according to this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13076540/requestanimationframe-for-begining-a-css-transition">question/answer from stackexchange</a>. </p>

<p>Therefore it seems that the 2nd code above is rendered rather redundant, and seemingly only results in extra code being called/used without any real benefit. Judging by this I'm going to use the <code>setInterval</code> (using <code>setTimeout</code> now, see edit below) approach for now, unless any further information becomes available which contradicts this conclusion. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> In addition to this I also stumbled upon the following approach, using <code>setTimeout</code> instead of <code>setInterval</code>. Using this means that there won't be made a check every 0,1 second as in the <code>setInterval</code> method. </p>

<pre><code>timeout = false;

window.onscroll = function () {
    if (!timeout) {
        timeout = setTimeout(function () {            
            clearTimeout(timeout);
            timeout = false;

                // functions

        }, 100);
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>You can replace your loop with <code>AddRange()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>public T CloneCollection&lt;T&gt;(IEmployees employees) where T : IEmployees, new()
{
    T collection = new T();
    collection.AddRange(employees);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Additional thought:</p>

<p>Note that your solution and this solution are simply cloning the list and not the items in the list.  If you update an <code>Employee</code>, the employee will be modified in both lists.  If this is NOT the desired behavior, you will need to clone each employee as well.</p>

<p>Your code is horrible:</p>

<ul>
<li>You don't check for end-of-file, which will lead to endless loops</li>
<li>You don't check for failure of <code>malloc</code> or <code>realloc</code></li>
<li>You call <code>realloc</code> way too often, which makes the code slow for large lines of input</li>
<li>You cast the result of <code>malloc</code></li>
<li>You use the outdated style of function definition from the 1980s</li>
<li>The variable <code>string</code> is not a string but points to an array of pointers to strings, which is confusing</li>
<li>The <code>#include</code> for <code>size_t</code> is missing</li>
<li>Using <code>[0]</code> instead of <code>*</code> is extremely confusing</li>
<li>There is no need to initialize <code>keystroke</code> to a space character</li>
<li>The parameter <code>size</code> is useless since the only possible value that makes sense for it is 0</li>
<li>The return type of the function is implicitly <code>int</code>, which is obsolete</li>
<li>The returned value is of type <code>size_t</code>, which doesn't fit into an <code>int</code> and additionally differs in signedness</li>
</ul>

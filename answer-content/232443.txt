<p>@Casey provided a general answer to a clean implementation. Though, decent compilers at optimization steps shouldn't be dependent on that, lest you wrote something really weird in the constructor.</p>

<p>For me the number 30 seems arbitrary. Could it be the case that you frequently use only a portion of the data? Or use a portion depending on situation? Or at times use more? Consider using an image/matrix like allocation method (check out opencv) with columns being the number of Particles and rows being the number of size of data in doubles that each particle allocates. In general if the struct uses 62 doubles then its move/copy operations are somewhat slow. Consider methods of usage that avoids this problem.</p>

<p>First of all, nice code, very readable and good comments.</p>

<p>There are several improvements you can do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Reindex your dataframe with <code>t</code>. You are writing a lot of times <code>.t</code>, if you will use <code>index</code> some of <code>pandas</code> index optimization will kick in and your code will be faster.</li>
<li>Do not do <code>concat</code> on only 2 items. Concatenate function will work much faster if you will just do all of the concatenation of all 5 elements at once.</li>
<li>Why do you need <code>h2</code>? Try to avoid unnecessary coping of the data frame. You can work on the original <code>h1</code> or even <code>idat</code> since your function does not change anything implicitly.</li>
<li>Use type annotations. Using type annotations can make the code run faster since the interpreter does not need to figure out what is the variable type. Also, probably even more important, it helps readability.</li>
</ol>

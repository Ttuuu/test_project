<p>First off, I see no reason to define p1 and p2, then put them into the playerlist, it would be more concise to simply define them inside plist's definition. </p>

<p>eg.</p>

<pre><code>plist = [Player(1,'X'), Player(2, 'O')]
</code></pre>

<p>As for the repetition of the if statements, you could set a global variable "gameOver" that gets set true upon a game ending event.</p>

<p>eg.</p>

<pre><code>#Before loops
gameOver = False

...

    #In for loop
        if not win and i&lt;9:
            pass
        elif not win and i==9:
            gameOver = True
            print('The match is a tie.')
            break
        else:
            gameOver = True
            break
    #In first while loop
    if gameOver:
        break
    else:
        pass
</code></pre>

<p>This last part is just personal opinion, but I feel like asking the user for row and column would be more intuitive than cell number.</p>

<p>Edit: I just realized you could just do <code>while not gameOver</code>, no need for the if else.</p>

<p>I agree with Vogel612 - Singleton is an anti-pattern because of nomerous reasons. Just don't.</p>

<p>However I want to mention the pattern "ServiceLocator" because it is very similar to your question. Maybe you want to read about it. But - just like the Singleton - the ServiceLocator is widely known as an anti-pattern.</p>

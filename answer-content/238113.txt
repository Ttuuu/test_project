<p>A few minor remarks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>All pointers to string literals should be <code>const</code> qualified to prevent accidental bugs. That is <code>const char*</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>if(line) free(line);</code> is pointless, just call <code>free(line)</code>. It is well-defined to call <code>free</code> with a null pointer as parameter, in which case it will do nothing. This is handy when you know that all your pointers that may point at stuff that needs to be freed were originally initialized to point at <code>NULL</code>.</p>
<p>(And similarly, it is good practice to assign the pointer to <code>NULL</code> after calling <code>free()</code>, if you plan to re-use that same pointer again.)</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>exit(0);</code> at the end of main is pointless and potentially confusing. You are using C99 so you actually don't need to write anything at all there. Not writing anything in C99 is identical to writing <code>return 0;</code>, which in turn is the same thing as calling <code>exit(0);</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

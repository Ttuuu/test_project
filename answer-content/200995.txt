<p>If your example means that, say, comment #1 is by user 8 about post 2,
and comment #2 is by user 9 about post 7 then you're doing it right.  This is a classic method to organize a table that relates the contents of other tables; you can use it to get all the comments on a particular post, or all the comments by a particular user, and so on.  Since the answers to those questions are "some, one, or more" the repeated values are not a problem.  If you saw the same exact combination in all three columns that might indicate a poor design -- but in this case it looks pretty appropriate.</p>

<p>The table as shown does not have a column for the actual comment data; you could add that here or foreign key to another table that contained the actual comment text. </p>

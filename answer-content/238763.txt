<p>It's a good idea to abstract this away. Otherwise you would end up with a lot of different callbacks. But I think your approach might be improved.</p>

<p>First: why do you use different actions instead of simply handling the different events and input names inside a reducer? Now you have conditionals inside the hook and probably inside the reducer for the different actions as well, right? Moving everything to the reducer might simplify things.</p>

<p>Having form state in the global redux state is btw not so great. It means that all your connected components might re-render on every input change. There are great solutions for handling forms in React like formik or react-form-hook. Latter gets a lot of traction currently</p>

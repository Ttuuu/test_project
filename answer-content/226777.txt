<h3>Things to improve</h3>

<ul>
<li>You are looping over the input twice; (1) when splitting the raw input string <code>Console.ReadLine().Trim().Split(' ')</code> (2) when going over the splitted items <code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; arrSize - 1; i++)</code>. Try finding a way to go over the raw input in a single pass.</li>
<li>You are parsing most items twice, once as <code>arr[i+1]</code> and once as <code>arr[i]</code> in the next cycle. Try avoiding redundant parsing.</li>
<li>Writing to the console is time expensive. <code>Console.Write("-1" + " ");</code> Try to find a way to build the string and write the result to the console once.</li>
</ul>

<p><sup>I just tested a solution taking into account the above and I got Execution Time: <code>1.21</code>. So it's definately possible to go &lt; <code>3.496</code></sup> </p>

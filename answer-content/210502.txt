<p>You can use the Java <code>WatchService</code> as described <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/notification.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>. You said that <code>WatchService</code> is too slow for you. There are other people who have had that problem and resolved it <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9588737/is-java-7-watchservice-slow-for-anyone-else">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9588737/is-java-7-watchservice-slow-for-anyone-else</a><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9588737/is-java-7-watchservice-slow-for-anyone-else">in this thread</a>.</p>

<p>On a side note, consider using <code>ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor</code> rather than <code>Thread.sleep</code>. The former will recreate threads if they are killed by an exception, has the potential to reuse threads in a pool, and has other potential advantages.</p>

<p>If you're exclusively interested in <code>for_each</code>, the Morwenn/Martin York response is pretty neat. Otherwise, a meaningful generalisation is the use of <code>std::tuple</code> with STL algorithms. To that end, your good bet is Jonathan MÃ¼ller's <a href="https://foonathan.net/blog/2017/03/01/tuple-iterator.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>tuple_iterator</code></a>. That would give you iterator access to <code>std::tuple</code>, which you would also be able to use for <code>std::for_each</code>, in particular.</p>

<p>I’d agree with all of l0b0’s answer – including the suggestion of using <code>grep</code> to process <code>/proc/cpuinfo</code>. An alternate way to count all CPU cores using an AWK one-liner would be:</p>

<pre><code>cpu_cores=$(awk '/cpu cores/ { num_cores += $4} END { print num_cores}' /proc/cpuinfo)
</code></pre>

<p>This would also remove the usage of Bash arrays, resulting in the script being POSIX-compatible – if that’s something you’re interested in. (<code>dash</code> performs better than <code>bash</code> for running scripts but any performance gain would be negated  by the time it takes to run <code>awk</code>).</p>

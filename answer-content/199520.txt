<p>For #3:</p>

<p>Specifically for this point, to make sure all the tasks in the pool have been closed and then proceed in executing next lines of the code, after the <code>shutdown()</code> command, just use <a href="http://https:%20//%20docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ExecutorService.html#isTerminated%20()" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> <code>service.isTerminated()</code> Java function. It returns true when all the tasks in the pool have been closed, then the loop will block execution through a busy wait until everything is closed.</p>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<pre><code>service.shutdown();
while (!service.isTerminated());
System.out.println("Finished all threads");
</code></pre>

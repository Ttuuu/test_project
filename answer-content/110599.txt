<p>First: this is a pretty tidy implementation and there is not much to say from the code review perspective.</p>

<p>Now about the question of necessity: Microsoft did include <code>SwitchTo</code> extension methods in the async CTP but <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/642ffef6-d3ce-4010-978d-bc5d8b65c00f/where-are-the-switchto-extensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">decided to remove them because they were open to misuse</a>. This doesn't mean something like this isn't useful but Microsoft has to consider a much wider audience and an innocuous <code>SwitchTo</code> call in the wrong place could easily lead to weird behaviors and random, hard to track down bugs causing potentially a fair amount of support work so they decided to not ship it (and also because it's reasonable easy to create yourself if you need it).</p>

<p>So essentially if you are careful to avoid using it within your own projects in potentially harmful places (like inside <code>catch</code> and <code>finally</code> blocks) this might be a nice tool in your library to have.</p>

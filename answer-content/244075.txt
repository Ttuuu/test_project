<pre><code>    # Code that creates a list of 100 'heads' or 'tails' values.
    results.append(random.choice(('H', 'T')))
</code></pre>
<p>This comment is severely misleading: the code does not create a list of 100 values, it create an infinitely growing list that extends up to <code>sampleSize</code> values by the time the program terminates.</p>
<hr>
<p>Independently of the misleading comment, this is a bad idea, and can be avoided by limiting the size of the <code>results</code> list in some say (<code>del results[:-6]</code>, or <code>results = results[-6:]</code>, I'm not sure which is better). This would also obsolete the <code>temp</code> variable, because the <code>results</code> array would no longer contain extra flips.</p>
<hr>
<pre><code>    try:
        temp = results[i-5:]
        if temp == head_streak or temp == tail_streak:
            numberOfStreaks += 1
    except:
        pass
</code></pre>
<p>Bare <code>except</code> statements are a bad idea. Bare <code>except:pass</code> statements even more so. Among other problems, it means that if you press Ctrl-C while your code is executing that section, the code won't exit.</p>
<p>It's not clear what exception you are trying to catch (<code>results[i-5:]</code> doesn't throw an error if <code>results</code> is less than five items long; it just truncates the list), so I can't suggest a direct replacement, but I would recommend either catching a specific exception, or removing the try-catch entirely.</p>
<hr>
<p>Python lists natively support negative indexing, so you can simplify <code>results[i-5:]</code> to <code>results[-6:]</code> and remove the <code>i</code> variable entirely. As suggested by the question asker in the comments, this makes the <code>enumerate</code> call unnecessary.</p>
<hr>
<p>The <code>i</code> variable will then be unused. It's clearer to name variables you don't use as <code>_</code>, so it's easy to tell that they aren't used.</p>
<hr>
<p>Full code:</p>
<pre><code>import random
numberOfStreaks = 0
results = []
head_streak = ['H'] * 6
tail_streak = ['T'] * 6
sample_size = 1000000
for _ in range(sample_size):
    # Code that generates another 'heads' or 'tails' value
    results.append(random.choice(('H', 'T')))

    # Code that checks if there is a streak of 5 heads or tails in a row.
    results = results[-6:]
    if results == head_streak or results == tail_streak:
        numberOfStreaks += 1

print('Chance of streak: %s%%' % (numberOfStreaks / sample_size))

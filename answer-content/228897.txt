<p>The solution makes sense, but like @dfhwze said, there are too many variables.</p>

<p>As a future maintainer, I skim your solution and wonder what <code>subtractLengths</code> is, because it's ambiguous unless you move your eyes up to read more code to get the context. It doesn't read very smoothly.</p>

<p>I would re-arrange it a bit to read more like this:</p>

<pre><code>str.lastIndexOf(target) + target.length === str.length
</code></pre>

<p>because that's easily parsable in English - the last mention of what you're looking for, plus how long it is, should be the end of the string. Only make variables (or in this case <code>const</code>s) if they are going to be re-used or if they help clarify the purpose of an expression.</p>

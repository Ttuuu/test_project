<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>unique_ptr&lt;Node&gt;&amp; right = node-&gt;right;
node = move(node-&gt;left); // it will destroy the previous node and right nodes
if (right) // right will be nullptr as the right nodes would have been destructed in the previous line
{...}
</code></pre>

<p>In your Delete() function, this logic seems to be flawed. When you move your node-&gt;left into node, then all the existing right nodes will be destroyed because you just created a reference of unique_ptr which doesn't stop the following move operation from deleting these nodes.</p>

<pre><code>if (right) {...}
</code></pre>

<p>So, in effect the above condition will never be true and also, you will lose the right nodes. </p>

<p>The correct way to do this will be to move the right nodes into a local variable something like this : </p>

<pre><code>auto right = std::move(node-&gt;right);
node = move(node-&gt;left);
if (right)  // Now, right will contain all the right nodes
{...}
</code></pre>

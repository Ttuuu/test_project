<p>Your story is basically a directed graph. From each question you can take multiple routes. So I would represent each question as such, with different types of nodes for when the user chooses, the choice is random or the game is over (either winning or loosing).</p>

<p>With this the actual calling code becomes very easy:</p>

<pre><code>if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~")
    print("Soviet Union, 1988")
    current = nodes["start"]
    while current.choices is not None:
        if current.message is not None:
            print("~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~")
            print(current)
        current = nodes[current.choose()]
    print(current)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I used a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/419163/what-does-if-name-main-do"><code>if __name__ == "__main__":</code> guard</a> to allow importing from this script from another script and made your "You win" and "Game over" strings raw strings (by prepending an <code>r</code>) so that the backslashes don't potentially escape the character after them.</p>

<p>This structure has the advantage that it is very easy to visualize the story as well. Add the following code:</p>

<pre><code>import sys

...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) &gt; 1 and sys.argv[1] == "--graph":
        print("digraph G {")
        for name, node in nodes.items():
            if node.choices is not None:
                for label, choice in node.choices.items():
                    print(f"{name} -&gt; {choice} [ label={label} ];")
        print("}")
    else:
        ...
</code></pre>

<p>And just run this with <code>python3 story_graph.py --graph | dot | display</code> to get this output:</p>

<p>@Jeroen already addressed the main itchy spot, so I'll just add a few <s>meaningless</s> <em>minor</em> points:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Indentation is off, the opening brace should line up with the method signature:</p>

<pre><code>public List&lt;string&gt; Conversion(int x)
{
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Parameter <code>x</code> would probably have a better, more meaningful name if it were called <code>value</code>.</p></li>
<li>You're returning a <code>List&lt;string&gt;</code>.... and I don't get it. That's violating the <em>Principle of Least Surprise</em>, your user would probably be expecting a <code>string</code> instead.</li>
</ul>
    </div>

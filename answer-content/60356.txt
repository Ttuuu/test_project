<p>You could make this a bit more robust. You might have control over what is generated, but it won't hurt to make sure of a few things:</p>

<p>Filter out any non-files:</p>

<pre><code> all_files = (x for x in os.listdir() if os.path.isfile(x))
</code></pre>

<p>You can iterate over a <code>set</code> just fine, no need to convert it back to a list. Further, <code>os</code> already has a <code>splitext</code> method that'll separate a filename into <code>(name, ext)</code>, and will give the <code>ext</code> as <code>''</code> if it doesn't exist (currently, your code will crash if there is no extension):</p>

<pre><code>filetypes = set((os.path.splitext(f)[1] for f in all_files]))
</code></pre>

<p>There is also a <code>move</code> command in <code>shutil</code> that you could use instead of a call to <code>os.system()</code>, which is likely to be a lot faster (and safer). To generate the file names, you can use <code>glob</code>:</p>

<pre><code>for ftype in filetypes[1:]:
    os.mkdir(ftype)
    for fname in glob.iglob('*.{0}'.format(ftype)):
        shutil.move(fname, ftype) 
</code></pre>

<p>If these files are somewhat important, you might want to consider copying and then delete them instead of moving them directly.</p>

  <p>Any help on how to optimize it?</p>

<p>Optimise <em>readability</em>, starting with following the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#comments" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Style Guide for Python Code</a>.<br>
(And yes, this is a useful step in <em>optimising efficiency</em>, too)  </p>

<p>(The below reads an ill-tempered diatribe more than a code review, the sole exculpation being the explicit question in the title. (I should look for a well-receives SE resource bound to exist.))  </p>

<p><em>How to write efficient source code for …?</em><br>
Given a specification that looks ready for implementation,<br>
- write tests shedding a light on correctness.<br>
- fix(!) a limit for the effort to improve <em>efficiency</em><br>
- <em>define</em> a measure for <em>efficient</em><br>
(-if applicable, define <em>relevant input data</em>)<br>
- automate measuring <em>efficiency</em> - memory usage is harder to assess than time used<br>
 (use available tools - <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">timeit</a>, for starters)<br>
 (It saves a lot of trouble to include (basic) functional tests here)<br>
 (Don't believe sub-second measurements.<br>
  Measure work completed in a fixed amount of time, not time used for a fixed amount of work.)<br>
- use your first working version to establish a <em>base line</em><br>
- fix(!) what performance is <em>good enough</em><br>
- pick alternative implementations, jot down your guesses re. <em>efficiency</em>, measure<br>
- time allowing (see <em>limit</em> above), experiment with improvements</p>

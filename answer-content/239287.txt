<p>I'd look at python decorators as something, that accepts function and returns function, which is usually original function wrapped in another function and some added behaviour.</p>

<p>Change signature of your "decorator" functions to match that and you got something like decorators. Don't have much time at the moment to write examples, but you get the idea :-)</p>

<p>Edit:
I took a closer look at your code, but it seems very specific to your framework and I can't make complete sense of it to dare refactoring (doesn't mean it's bad code). At least here are some examples of wrapper functions to help you started:

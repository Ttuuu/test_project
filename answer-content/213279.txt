<h1>Program does not work correctly</h1>

<p>Your function says the maximum byte is 0 for the simple test case <code>byte input[] = { 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,3,4 }</code>. The issue is this line: <code>while (*data++)</code>. You have it correct for the Min case.</p>

<h1>Keep it simple</h1>

<p>A simple for loop is sufficient to iterate through the array, it is much easier to understand. You don't have to deal with pointer arithmetic like <code>*(src + srcIndex++)</code>, just use indexing. </p>

<pre><code>for (index = 0; index &lt; size; ++index)
{
    if (src[index] &gt; largest)
    {
        largest = src[index];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is still using pointers.</p>

<h1>Check for NULL.</h1>

<p>You have not checked if <code>src</code> or <code>val</code> is NULL. This results in program crash due to dereferencing NULL pointer.</p>

<h1><code>uint* data = src</code>;</h1>

<p>This is dangerous because you are trying to access a <code>char</code> using pointer to <code>int</code>. The result is not what you expect it to be. It should be <code>byte * data = src;</code>. 
<code>uint largest</code> and <code>uint smallest</code> should be <code>byte largest</code> and <code>byte smallest</code>.</p>

<h1>Swap the order of switch condition and loop</h1>

<p>You can simplify your function by swapping the order of iterating over the array and checking if you want maximum or minimum. This way reduces the chance of making copy and paste error like the bug with maximum case.</p>

<p>Your last question is missing some context, you should see if the above solves your problem. If not then post a new question.</p>

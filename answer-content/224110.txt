<p>A function should Do One Thing Well.</p>

<p>Yes, this function <em>does</em> have a single stated goal.
But accomplishing that breaks down quite naturally into the goals of:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>SmallNumToWords(n)</code>, for input 0 &lt;= <code>n</code> &lt;= 999.</li>
<li><code>NumToWords(n)</code> for non-negative <code>n</code>, which repeatedly breaks out small <code>n</code> and calls the helper function.</li>
</ol>

<p>Adding several unit tests would be a boon to the casual reader.</p>

<p>Numbers a little bigger than ten are slightly annoying, granted.
But since they "escaped" from the one's place,
perhaps <code>Small</code> would be a more accurate identifier?</p>

<p>Pat Sajack would be happy to let you use <code>Scale</code>,
you don't even have to buy a vowel.</p>

<p>nit: <code>Tens</code> would be more consistent with how you spelled the other identifiers.</p>

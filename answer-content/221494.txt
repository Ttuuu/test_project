<p>Let's consider the results of numbers around 10 as an example : </p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>7 % 10 = 7
8 % 10 = 8
9 % 10 = 9
10 % 10 = 0
11 % 10 = 1
12 % 10 = 2
13 % 10 = 3
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>We know that 8 to 12 should be included.</p>

<p>For 10 to 12 it's easy, we just need to check if their modulo is smaller than 2.</p>

<pre><code>public boolean nearTen(int num) {
    int modulo = num % 10;
    return modulo &lt;= 2;
}
</code></pre>

<p>For 8 and 9, if we look at the above results, we can see that the difference between their modulo and the original number will give us a number under 2. So we'll add that to the algorithm:</p>

<pre><code>public boolean nearTen(int num) {
    int modulo = num % 10;
    return modulo &lt;= 2 || num - modulo &lt;= 2;
}
</code></pre>

<p>With that, we covered all cases. When facing a problem like this one, don't be afraid to write down the results and try to find a match.</p>

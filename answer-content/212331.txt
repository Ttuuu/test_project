<p>Your algorithm does not reset the counters when necessary.</p>

<p>Assume an input with a large number of <code>0</code>s followed by <code>10</code> followed by a large number of <code>1</code>s: <code>000...00010111...111</code>.</p>

<p>The result should be 3 since there are three substrings <code>01</code>, <code>10</code>, and <code>01</code> that satisfy the requirement. However, since <code>count0</code> is not reset, it stays large and lets <code>total</code> be incremented for each trailing <code>1</code>.</p>

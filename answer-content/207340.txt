<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>The heavy memory usage was because of the <code>calculate_fitness()</code> function.</p>

<p>I declared a new fitness function from CEC2005 every time I wanted to calculate the fitness, rather than pass in the already declared function.</p>

<p>There are no memory issues anymore. Apologies to any that may have tried to figure it out.</p>

<p>biggest thing thats going to make a difference to your programming style / quality from the looks of it  :-  functions</p>

<p>break the code up into a lot more little useful functions.   A lot of the awkwardness of the code is because you haven't done this.</p>

<p>look for the repeated code / code with the same structure but slight variations, look at how you could wrap it up in a little function.</p>

<p>in programming terms there's a concept called levels of perspective.   there are 3 levels, conceptual / specification / implementation  ( I wrote something about it here <a href="http://designingcode.blogspot.com/2006/12/its-matter-of-perspective.html" rel="nofollow">http://designingcode.blogspot.com/2006/12/its-matter-of-perspective.html</a>)   </p>

<p>basically you are mixing specification with implementation and it makes the code a bit messy.   </p>

<p>so </p>

<p>yhe code should look something like this (perhaps) at the specification perhaps:-</p>

<pre><code>if( pitch == pitches.BALL)    // or more probably as part of a switch/case
{
   if( this.reachedBallLimit() )
   {
       this.walk();
   }

}
</code></pre>

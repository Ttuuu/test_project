<p>Your code:</p>

<pre><code>if(RS_1 &gt; RS_2) {
   if(RS_2 == 0) {
      // do A
   } else {
      ODINO_0:
      // do B
   }
} if(RS_1 &lt; RS_2) {
   if(RS_1 == 0) {
      goto ODINO_0;
   }
   // do C
}
</code></pre>

<p>can be rewritten as:</p>

<pre><code>if(RS_2 == 0) {
   // do A
} else if(RS_1 &gt; RS_2 || RS_1 == 0) {
   // do B
} else if(RS_1 &lt; RS_2) {
   // do C
}
</code></pre>

<p>under the assumption that these two values are never negative. If they can be negative there are some additional tests necessary.</p>

<p>I have nothing against <code>goto</code>, sometimes it's clean and clear. In this case, however, it is confusing, it takes a while to figure out where it jumps to.</p>

<p>Regarding naming: please use longer variable and function names. 3-letter all-caps names look like Fortran 66 code. It is hard to read your code because variable names are meaningless, and there is no comments explaining their use. Good variable names make code easy to read (and there is no need for comments if they are good enough). Plus, modern IDEs do name completion, you don't even have to type the full names any more. :D</p>

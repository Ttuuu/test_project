<p>I am in the same boat (or you can call me a dinosaur too). The foreach loop is almost as readadable as natural English, whereas lambda makes you always to stumble. So I would stick to foreach. </p>

<p>As of the code review, I would initialize the resulting array first and also use the O(1) search instead of O(n) as array keys can be found real fast without looping over all values.</p>

<pre><code>$selectedPeopleKeyed = array_flip($selectedPeople);
$attendeeNames = [];
foreach ($allPeople as $person) {
    $id = $person['id'];
    $name = $person['name'];
    if (array_key_exists($id, $selectedPeopleKeyed)) {
        $attendeeNames[] = $name;
    }
}

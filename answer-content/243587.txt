<p>Since you are concerned about execution speed, you should write this program in some other programming languages as well and compare their performance. I'd take Java, C++, Go, Perl, Python and Rust. Traditionally, AWK gets the job done but is not optimized for processing huge amounts of data.</p>

<p>Instead of setting <code>FS</code> on the command line, it should be in a <code>BEGIN</code> clause since it is an essential part of the program:</p>

<pre><code>BEGIN {
    FS = /[[:digit:]]+/;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Asking for code that is not yet implemented is off-topic on this site, so I won't comment much on that. The code will become much larger by that requirement though and will require more thought. Be prepared to have a collection of small sample files to test the edge cases automatically.</p>

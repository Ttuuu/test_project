<p>Just small addition to great answers.</p>

<h1>Commenting obvious stuff</h1>

<p>I would delete all comments, really. You can safely assume that people who read you code will know what constructor etc is.
Such commenting is really distracting.</p>

<pre><code>// Constructors
    SingleLinkedList() = default;                                           // empty constructor 
    SingleLinkedList(SingleLinkedList const &amp;source);                       // copy constructor
</code></pre>

<h1>Small inconsistency</h1>

<p>In one case you are using <code>auto</code> (correct)</p>

<pre><code>for (auto current = head.get(); current != nullptr; current = current-&gt;next.get()) {
    size++;
}
</code></pre>

<p>In other case you don't.</p>

<pre><code>for (Node* loop = head.get(); loop != nullptr; loop = loop-&gt;next.get()) {
    str &lt;&lt; loop-&gt;data &lt;&lt; "\t";
}
</code></pre>

<p>It is really important (especially in big projects with millions LOC) to keep things as much consistent as you can.</p>

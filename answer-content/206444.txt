<pre><code>def avg_cagr(percents: List[int]) -&gt; float:
    '''Given (successive) % annual growth rates, returns average Compound Annual Growth Rate'''
    amount = reduce(mul, [1+p/100 for p in percents])
    return (amount**(1/len(percents)) - 1)*100
</code></pre>

<p>In a production environment you might want to accept a larger variety of input types for percents. E.g. many people use NumPym would this code also work if <code>percents</code> were passed as an array instead of list?
You might also want to adopt a Numpy style or Google style code commenting (it is good practice to get used to a standard form of commenting on every class/function your write). To be clearer one thing is that highlighting to the user that percentages are percentage points (3) not decimal (0.03).</p>

<pre><code>def dirichlet(n: int = 5, amount: float = 100) -&gt; List[float]:
    '''Returns n random numbers which sum to "amount"'''
    random_returns = np.random.dirichlet(alpha=np.ones(n), size=1)[0]*amount
    return random_returns
</code></pre>

<p>What is the rationale for using the Dirichlet distribiution? Are you aware that if you use <code>alpha=1</code> you are effectively using a uniform distribution, so are making your code overly complicated and less efficient?</p>

<p>I understand this is a simulation, possibly just a code exercise, but are you aware you can prove these things with simply mathematics, in which case the purpose seems somewhat moot?</p>

<p>Are you trying to solve this problem:</p>

<p><span class="math-container">$$ \max_x \quad f(x) = (1+x_1)(1+x_2)..(1+x_n) $$</span>
<span class="math-container">$$ subject \; to \quad \sum_i x_i = K $$</span>
Using Lagrange multipliers:
<span class="math-container">$$ L(x) = f(x) - \lambda(K-\sum_i x_i) $$</span>
<span class="math-container">$$ \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_i} = 0 = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} + \lambda \quad \forall \; i \quad \implies x_i = \frac{1}{K}$$</span>
You further examine whether this is indeed the global maximum by showing f(x) is a concave function (or that its logarithm is). And it will hold for any choice of x_i regardless of what distribution you sample from.</p>

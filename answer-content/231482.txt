<p>Readability of this code is good because indentation is consistent and it has a good amount of comments to provide context on the variables and functions. </p>

<p>I see this block:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>//support functions
//generate random int a&lt;=x&lt;=b
function randint(a, b) {
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * (b - a + 1) + a);
  }
  //generate random float
function randRange(a, b) {
    return Math.random() * (b - a) + a;
  }
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The comment above <code>randRange</code> explains that it creates a random float - which makes me wonder why the name isn't something like <code>randFloat</code>? And why are the closing brackets indented two characters? Maybe that was an issue with copying and pasting followed by formatting as code...</p>

<p>A common convention of c-based languages, as well as many JS style guides is to name constants in ALL_CAPS so things like <code>maxOpacity</code> would be converted to <code>MAX_OPACTIY</code>. This helps anyone reading the code distinguish constants from variables. One could also use <code>const</code> for any value that doesn't get re-assigned if <a href="/questions/tagged/ecmascript-6" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'ecmascript-6'" rel="tag">ecmascript-6</a> features are supported by target browsers.</p>

<p>There doesn't appear to be any difference between <code>colors</code> and <code>bgColors</code> but maybe you intend for users to customize one or both of those...</p>

<p>I agree that this is a little complicated.</p>

<p>I'd recommend you write a set of tests, and let those guide the complexity of the code. The tests would be simple, like,</p>

<pre><code>assertEq convertPriceIntoFloat("1298,90"), 1298.9
assertEq convertPriceIntoFloat("1.298,90"), 1298.9
assertEq convertPriceIntoFloat("1.298,90 â‚¬"), 1298.9
...
</code></pre>

<p>Then, start out with a simple <code>float</code> conversion in your code, and see if that works, then add test cases and only add code as you need it. If things do seem to be getting overly complicated, refactor... you'll have tests that let you do that easily.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>

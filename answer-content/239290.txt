<p>Overall, your code looks great. It's nicely structured, and having a well-defined <code>answer</code> type makes immediately clear what the question is about.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the code, <code>i=0</code> is missing some spaces.</p>

<p>You can improve the speed of the bubble sort by 50% by not counting <code>j</code> from 0 to size but only from 0 to <code>size - 1 - i</code>, since the last few elements are already bubbled up and therefore don't change anymore.</p>

<p>For testing, you should add another counter for the number of comparisons.</p>

<p>To test that your code is indeed correct, you should add an automatic test that takes a large array, fills it with 0 to size and shuffles the array. After sorting it should be the same as before.</p>

<p>I'm not sure whether the C++ compiler is smart enough to know that the vector's size doesn't change during the bubble sort. To get a simple performance boost, compute <code>v.size()</code> once and store it in a local variable. Measure the performance difference using a large array that is already sorted.</p>

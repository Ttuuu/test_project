<p>As much as I agree with @TorbenPutkonen regarding the current state of the code, I would <em>not</em> go so far as to remove the constants.</p>

<p>They have one big advantage over having the strings in the methods, which is <em>being all in one place</em>.</p>

<p>If your config grows longer and more complex with an ongoing project, as eventually more complex methods creep into your config class (e.g. falling back to a calculated value or to a default value), your code will grow so that you don't see all the constants in a single glance anymore. <em>That</em> is the time, when you will be thankful for an overview of all keys at the top of the class.</p>

<p>For now, it's just YAGNI ;-)</p>

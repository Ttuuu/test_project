<p>Personally I wouldn't do this.<br></p>

<p>The reason why is when your field change name, your test fails because the field is hardcoded there and with refactoring this isn't persisted to the test.</p>

<p>What should I do?</p>

<p>Normally your <code>AuthorizationBeanTest</code> is in the same package as your <code>AuthorizationBean</code>.<br>
When this is correct you could use a protected method.</p>

<p>Example :</p>

<pre><code>protected boolean isUserNull () {
    return user==null;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is completely safe in your pojo, nobody could even acces the <code>User</code> object.<br>
And outside the package no one will ever see this method.<br></p>

<p>The advantage is when you refactor <code>user</code> or the method name, your test is automatically updated. </p>

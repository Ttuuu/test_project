<p>Looks fine for me. As a note - instead of using <code>Write-Output</code> for display purposes use <code>Write-Host</code> cmdlet. </p>

<p>In a nutshell, <code>Write-Host</code> writes to the console itself. Think of it as a <code>MsgBox</code> in <code>VBScript</code>. <code>Write-Output</code>, on the other hand, writes to the pipeline, so the next command can accept it as its input. You are not required to use <code>Write-Output</code> in order to write objects, as <code>Write-Output</code> is implicitly called for you.</p>

<p>The method has definitely too many arguments and the reason for that is because it does too much. When you look at its name you could think it removes a XML node but under the cover it does three things:</p>

<ul>
<li>it loads a document</li>
<li>it then does its job of removing a node</li>
<li>it then saves the document under new name</li>
</ul>

<p>If you properly separated these three concerns your APIs would have much simpler signatures.</p>

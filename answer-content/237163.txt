<p>In general the code is simple and concise.</p>

<p>Depending on the target usage, apart from what other answers suggest, I would add:</p>

<ul>
<li>support for files ending on ". jpeg" not only .jpg;</li>
<li>likewise I would make filename filter also find uppercase or mixed case JPEG files;</li>
<li>if I had to deal with unreliable sources I would add also Image.verify() and/or imghdr checks to see if I get a valid jpeg file, and to give meaningful error messages otherwise.</li>
</ul>
    </div>

<p>There's a subtle issue with this line in the <code>get_random_card</code> function:</p>

<pre><code>srand(time(NULL));
</code></pre>

<p>You're seeding the random number generator with the current time, each time <code>get_random_card</code> is called, which means multiple calls within the same second will have the same sequence of random numbers. In this specific case, it doesn't affect anything (other than a small performance penalty) because of the <code>do ... while (deck[random_index]-&gt;dealt == true);</code>, which will loop until it gets to the next number in the sequence anyway. If you change the implementation though, or use random numbers somewhere else in the program, you could run into subtle bugs where the numbers aren't as random as you think they are.</p>

<p>You should be calling <code>srand(time(NULL))</code> once at the beginning of the program, then leave the seed alone in <code>get_random_card</code>.</p>

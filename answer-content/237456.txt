<p>You can improve this code by removing unnecessary repetition. If you put a trailing slash after each declaration, then you do not need to repeat the same code over and over again. I would also suggest wrapping all the similar statements inside of <code>IfModule</code> checks: it only takes the server a fraction of a second, maybe less, to check if a module is installed; if it is not, it will skip straight past that section of the code. </p>

<p>There honestly wouldn't be a noticeable difference between GZip &amp; DEFLATE: the only difference is that GZip uses a checksum, header &amp; footer which are also included. Hence a tiny bit slower, but more reliable and secure. </p>

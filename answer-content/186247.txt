<p>I can suggest you use common table expression (Oracle calls it <a href="https://oracle-base.com/articles/misc/with-clause" rel="nofollow noreferrer">"Subquery Factoring"</a>) at the very least you will be doing the filtering by date and name one time only</p>

<pre><code>WITH filter_by_date_name AS ( 
  SELECT CODE_A, CODE_B, CODE_C FROM table_one WHERE date=myDate AND name=myName
)
SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM filter_by_date_name) AS total,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM filter_by_date_name WHERE CODE_A BETWEEN 100 AND 199) AS code_a_low_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM filter_by_date_name WHERE CODE_A BETWEEN 200 AND 299) AS code_a_high_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM filter_by_date_name WHERE CODE_B BETWEEN 100 AND 199) AS code_b_low_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM filter_by_date_name WHERE CODE_B BETWEEN 200 AND 299) AS code_b_high_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM filter_by_date_name WHERE CODE_C BETWEEN 100 AND 199) AS code_c_count
FROM filter_by_date_name
WHERE ROWNUM=1
</code></pre>

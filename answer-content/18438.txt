<p>I'm no Java guru but some things to consider might be:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Separate the UI display from the find algorithm i.e. don't have <code>System.out.println</code> in the method.</p></li>
<li><p>Supply the array list as a parameter to a method.  So I would probably think the top level method to do this match might be something like</p>

<pre><code>public Integer getMissingValue(ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; source) {
    // code
}
</code></pre>

<p>This way you could re-use the code in different contexts and even write some unit tests for it with varying values.</p></li>
<li><p>You code assumes the array list is sequential 1 - 100 does it not?  I don't see that stated in the question. If the supplied list was in a random order I don't think your answer would work.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you read the question properly.  It states integers 1 - 100.  You have accounted for integers 0 - 99.</p></li>
<li><p>In an interview question like this I would always consider writing it using TDD.  Interviewers like to see unit tests even if they don't ask for it.  It shows you care about testing your code and also potentially shows good thought processes into the way you might take a problem.</p></li>
</ol>

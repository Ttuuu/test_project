<p>Why don't you split both conditions into 2 diffrent validations? I think it's cleaner and easier to read (ie more maintenable).</p>

<pre><code>validates :inn, presence: true, uniqueness: true, if: :user_is_client #no idea about that `inn` option on your example
validates :inn, absence: true, if: :user_is_department

def user_is_client
  user.is_a?(Client)
end

def user_is_department
  user-is_a?(Department)
end
</code></pre>

<p>Personally, I prefer to be more verbose some times. Also, I think this way conditions are checked only once each, the other way each condition is checked for each validation since rails has to evaluate all blocks.</p>

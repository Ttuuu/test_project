<p>What I'm seeing is that you touch the data twice. This isn't necessary for retrieving a simple fact about the data.</p>

<p>Consider, saving the length of each word and comparing lengths as you go along. Even with a perfectly linear sort function (That is, O(n-1)) this will still cut down on algorithm complexity, simply because you aren't calling a sort function at all.</p>

<p>EDIT: I had a variable saving the word as well as the length, but after reading over your question again, I found that that isn't what you were looking for.
EDIT2: I removed my code because you said you wanted HINTs. sorry...</p>

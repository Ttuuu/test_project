<p>You're doing a lot of work for no gain. If you really can guarantee that there will never be more than 100 items in the list, why not go ahead and create 100 strings, store them, and assigned them the the items during your ordering phase. </p>

<p>You can just reuse the same set of strings each time, never do any work formatting, and get some efficiency because the ordering step would just be running through a loop assigning values from one array (in order) to the objects in the other array (in order):</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; myItems.Count; i++)
{
    myItems[i].Key = listOf100Strings[i];
}
</code></pre>
    </div>

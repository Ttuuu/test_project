<h1>Thinking about naming...</h1>
<ul>
<li>When I see a single capital letter, it makes me think of generic type.  I find your usage misleading.</li>
<li>Single letter variable names can be OK when it's obvious what they are, such as indexers in loops, I would suggest avoiding them for anything with larger scope, particularly at the field level.</li>
<li><code>int V;  // Number of vertices</code>, why not just call it <code>numberOfVertices</code>?  You don't need the comment and the rest of the code is that little bit easier to interpret?</li>
<li><code>edges()</code>: Typically in Java I'd expect this type of method to be called <code>getEdges</code>, it's really just returning the field.  In fact, when I first saw it, I thought it would be returning some collection of edges, but it doesn't it just returns a count.  Consider renaming it to match what it returns.</li>
<li><code>LinkedList&lt;Integer&gt; llOne = new LinkedList&lt;&gt;();</code>.  Generally, avoid embedding the type information (ll) in the variable name.  Think about what the list is representing and call it that, rather than 'one' and 'two'.</li>
</ul>

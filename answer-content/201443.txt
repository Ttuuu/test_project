<li><p>The code is unnecessarily large. All you basically need to calculate pitch is: subtract 'A' from note, add octave multiplied by 12 (and check if note is more than 'B' so the octave should be one-less), change that number by one semitone if note is sharp or flat. Two additions, one branch, that's all.</p></li>
<li><p>You have some strange logic with sharps and flats. Why do you ignore the second character in <code>"Fb3"</code>? Flats and sharps are merely modifications to pitch, they are not bound rigidly to black keys.</p></li>
<li><p>The whole MIDI range consists of 128 notes and it greatly exceeds any live instrument range (and it is slightly less than what human's ear can perceive in principle); and note that it is even more than what you can encode using three-character strings, you only have 122 notes from Cb0 to B#9. You don't need to calculate <code>pow</code> each time, a small array of 122 carefully pre-calculated doubles would be much faster and more precise.</p></li>

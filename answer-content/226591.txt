<p>Without knowing more about the <code>kubernetes</code> API that's hard to say, maybe you'd be more lucky on StackOverflow instead.</p>

<p>That said, if there's no explicit function to check, probably not.</p>

<p>Especially the status code 404 sounds like it would probably mean "not present", so this doesn't seem overly bad actually.</p>

<p>Is it intentional that all other <code>ApiException</code>s also return <code>false</code>?  If so, than there's no point to check for the 404.  If not, they should be thrown again.</p>

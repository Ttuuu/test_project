<p>It is a good thing you completely seperated your testing code from the code you're testing.</p>

<p>All your tests have the same basic structure, so why not create an array containing: </p>

<pre><code>[1 =&gt; "I",
 2 =&gt; "II",
 3 =&gt; "III",
 4 =&gt; "IV",
 5 =&gt; "V",
 ............];
</code></pre>

<p>And use that array to run your tests. You could even use the same array to test a function that does the inverse.</p>

<p>Moreso, having the inverse function is almost a must. It would further simplify the testing, since you can convert decimals to Roman numerals and back again. That way you don't need an array at all to do many tests.</p>

<p>Please pay attention to the names you choose. To me <code>RMC</code> doesn't mean much. If you encounter this class name two years from now, will you immediately know what it means? I don't think so. Why not give it a proper name like: <code>RomanNumerals</code>? This class could have two methods: <code>toRoman()</code> and <code>toDecimal()</code>. The <code>intVal()</code> method name is confusing because there is already an <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.intval.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">intval()</a> function which does something else.</p>

<h1>Your questions</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is this a good work flow for TDD? If not, what could I improve?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You understand the basic principle, however I think it would have been possible to write all the tests before writing the real code. This is also often done in real life: The tests are known before the code is written. <em>The writing of the code is driven by the tests.</em> Or, to put it in another way: If you don't know what you're going to test, then how on earth could you write any code?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Did I run enough tests? Do I need to write more?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I illustrated before, by writing the inverse function as well, you can do thousands of tests, without having to be very selective about it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it okay that, during intVal() re-writes, previous tests broke? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, that's fine. That's the whole idea behind test-driver-development: The tests tell you what's wrong.</p>

<p>Remember that there are frameworks for writing tests. It is clearly possible to work without them, but why reinvent the wheel again? See, for instance: <a href="https://phpunit.de" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PHPUnit</a></p>

<p>You mentioned you're hitting the narvar API?</p>

<p>Without having looked to deeply at your code, try to identify if it's a 'bulk' issue, you mentioned the number 200k (does this mean you hit the API 200k times a day?, see if it's rate limited by the narvar API). If this is the case, look for 'bulk import' / 'bulk actions' in the API, maybe it's throttled for your payment plan, etc... </p>

<p>Whenever I hear 'smallish' numbers (like 200k per day), I think network problems. I wouldn't suspect it's due to the performance of your code.</p>

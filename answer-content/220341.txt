<p>As noted in another answer for this question and previously in an answer to your earlier question:</p>

<p>It might be better to use a ranged for loop using iterators rather than an index for loop:</p>

<pre><code>    for (auto i : allProducts) {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; i-&gt;getProductName() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This may improve performance as well. It is equivalent to <code>for each</code> in other languages.</p>

<p>Unlike some other languages such as PHP, the <code>this</code> keyword is not generally required in C++ and is generally not used. There may be certain special cases where it is required.</p>

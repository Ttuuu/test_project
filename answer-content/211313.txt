<li><p>The code needs a lot more comments to say <em>why</em>. Why is each <code>question_x</code> written as it is written? Why is there a loop over 10000? My best guess is that the questions hard-code a strategy and you test it with 10000 random configurations, but (a) that should be made explicit (and so should the strategy itself); and (b) you should explain why you test 10000 random configurations when there are only 12 possible configurations.</p></li>
<li><p>The use of globals is very confusing. I strongly suggest passing around an explicit state.</p></li>

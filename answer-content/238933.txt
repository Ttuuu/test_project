<p>I would create more classes:</p>

<p>An interface Operation with the functions:</p>

<ul>
<li>getQuestionString</li>
<li>checkAnswer<br>
at the moment, you don't need this.<br>
Add this when you want to add questions with multiple possible answers eg. 3/4 and 6/8</li>
<li>getAnswer</li>
<li>next</li>
</ul>

<p>checkAnswer takes a String: the one the user answered and return if it is the correct answer.</p>

<p>You then can create different subclasses: SumOperation, ProductOperation, SubtractOperation</p>

<p>You add a constructor asking for the <code>maximumNumber1</code> and <code>maximumNumber2</code>.<br>
You could call those constructor straight from your program, but it would be even better if you created subclasses (eg. SimpleSumOperation, HardProductOperation) where you define these values.<br>
This is necessary if you would have operations that takes more and/or other arguments.</p>

<p>When you add these operations to an array based upon the user choosen level, you can select a random value of this array call <code>next</code> on the question and you have your next question.</p>

<h1>factory</h1>

<p>You could add even more classes...<br>
If you remove next from you question and if the questions don't longer ask for a maxRand but for the specific values instead, you can do the exact same quiz twice.<br>
This means you do need to create those operations.<br>
You can do this yourself, by calling the constructors with the specific values, but you could also create a factory for each operation (eg. ProductOperationFactory).</p>

<p>This factory could take the difficulty and 
know about the random values for each difficulty, but you could also create a subclass for each factory (eg. SimpleSubtractFactory).<br>
You can add these factories to an array, random select a factory and then create the question which you then ask.</p>

<p>This are all suggestions which you all can ignore if you want.
Using all of my suggestions would mean that instead of a class you get a big fat program which could be way to much for what you want.</p>

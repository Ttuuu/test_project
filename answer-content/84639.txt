<p>For one thing you might want to be a bit more forgiving with non-digits.
The original atoi just returns 0 if there are non-digits, terminating the program due to a non-digit is a bit harsh.</p>

<hr>

<p>underscores in front of your function name is not recommended, my_atoi would do.</p>

<hr>

<p>check the parameter if it is null before dereferencing it to avoid error, just return 0 - optionally print a message to stderr.</p>

<hr>

<p>other than that i find it was quite clever way of calculating atoi, it took me a moment to understand it -- sometimes it is better to let the compiler optimize the code for you than try to write too clever code.</p>

<p><strong>Making the code easier to read with variables</strong></p>

<p>Having all the accesses to <code>row[something]</code> everywhere makes the code hard to read and to update.
A good idea could be to introduce variables with meaningful names. You'd get for instance <code>x = row[3]</code>.</p>

<p>Also Python offers a concise way to do this: iterable unpacking.</p>

<p>In your case, you could write something like:</p>

<pre><code>        timestamp, vehicle_id, event, x, y, user_id = row
</code></pre>

<p>And by using these variables instead of accessing <code>row</code>, your code is already much prettier (and may be slighly faster as well).</p>

<p>We could go further and also define:</p>

<pre><code>        coord = Point(float(x), float(y))
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Use <code>if/else</code> for mutually exclusive conditions</strong></p>

<p>You check <code>if event == 'DROP'</code> then <code>if event == 'START_RIDE'</code>. Of course, at most one of these can be true. I can be a good habit to use <code>elif</code> in this case. Also, you can take this chance to add a case to handle unknown events.</p>

<pre><code>def main():
    myDict = defaultdict(dict)
    aDict = {}
    totalDrops = 0
    maxCar = None
    with open('events.txt') as f:
        reader = csv.reader(f)
        for row in reader:
            timestamp, vehicle_id, event, x, y, user_id = row
            coord = Point(float(x), float(y))
            if event == 'DROP':
                totalDrops += 1 
                myDict[vehicle_id]['drop'] = coord 
            elif event == 'START_RIDE':
                myDict[vehicle_id]['start_ride'] = coord
            elif event == 'END_RIDE':
                singleTripDistance = myDict[vehicle_id]['drop'].distance(coord)
                distanceTraveled = myDict[vehicle_id]['start_ride'].distance(coord)
                aDict[vehicle_id] = singleTripDistance
                if not maxCar:
                    maxCar = vehicle_id
                if 'allDistances' not in myDict[vehicle_id]:
                    myDict[vehicle_id]['allDistances'] = distanceTraveled
                else:
                    myDict[vehicle_id]['allDistances'] += distanceTraveled
                if  myDict[vehicle_id]['allDistances'] &gt; myDict[maxCar]['allDistances']:

<p><strong>Non-required dependency</strong></p>

<p>You've used an external dependency to handle the logic computing the distance.</p>

<p>It is good to avoid the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Not Invented Here syndrom</a> and avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinventing_the_wheel" rel="nofollow noreferrer">re-inventing the wheel</a>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, dependencies on external packages are sometimes undesirable because of the amount of code you are using/integrating with no or little knowledge about.</p>

<p>I do not know what was the point of view of the staff reviewing your code but <strong>maybe</strong> they'd have appreciated if you had defined a simple class like:</p>

<pre><code>class Point():
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    def distance(self, other):
        dx = self.x - other.x
        dy = self.y - other.y
        return math.sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy)
</code></pre>

<p>Add a bit of doc and/or tests and it makes for a first good impression.</p>

<p><strong>Variable names</strong></p>

<p><code>myDict</code> is not a great variable names as it does not convey much meanings. Maybe <code>vehicles</code> would be better or <code>vehicles_dict</code>...</p>

<p>Also, there is a style guide in Python called <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP 8</a>. It is a highly recommended read. Among other things, it advices to use <code>snake_case</code> for variable names (instead of <code>camelCase</code>).</p>

<p><strong>More variables</strong></p>

<p>It may be worth defining yet another variable to make the code more concise:</p>

<pre><code>        vehicle = vehicles[vehicle_id]
</code></pre>

<p>Then, we'd have something like:</p>

<pre><code>def main():
    vehicles = defaultdict(dict)
    aDict = {}
    total_drops = 0
    max_car = None
    with open('events.txt') as f:
        reader = csv.reader(f)
        for row in reader:
            timestamp, vehicle_id, event, x, y, user_id = row
            coord = Point(float(x), float(y))
            vehicle = vehicles[vehicle_id]
            if event == 'DROP':
                total_drops += 1 
                vehicle['drop'] = coord 
            elif event == 'START_RIDE':
                vehicle['start_ride'] = coord
            elif event == 'END_RIDE':
                singleTripDistance = vehicle['drop'].distance(coord)
                distanceTraveled = vehicle['start_ride'].distance(coord)
                aDict[vehicle_id] = singleTripDistance
                if not max_car:
                    max_car = vehicle_id
                if 'allDistances' not in vehicle:
                    vehicle['allDistances'] = distanceTraveled
                else:
                    vehicle['allDistances'] += distanceTraveled
                if  vehicle['allDistances'] &gt; vehicles[max_car]['allDistances']:
                    max_car = vehicle_id
            else:
                print("Unexpected event ", e)
        maxSingleTrip = max(zip(aDict.values(), aDict.keys()))
        print('There are ' + '' + str(total_drops) + ' ' + 'total Drops.' + '\n' + 'The Car that ends up furthest away from its drop is:' + ' ' + str(maxSingleTrip[1]) + ' ' + 'and the distance is:' + ' ' + str(maxSingleTrip[0]) + '\n' + 'The Car with the highest total distance traveled is:' + ' ' + max_car + ', ' + 'and the total distance is:' + ' ' +  str(vehicles[max_car]['allDistances']))
main()

<p><strong>Data structure</strong></p>

<p>From the way the problem is stated, it looks like the staff was interested in seeing which data structure you'd use and how.</p>

<p>Defining a dictionnary mapping vehicles identifiers to other data is definitly good into the right directions.</p>

<p><em>I may stop this review at any time. Don't be surprised if it looks unfinished, I may try to get back to this later.</em></p>

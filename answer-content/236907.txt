<p>Unfortunately for your interview hopes, the code you wrote doesn't solve the problem. Try this input:</p>

<pre><code>findWinner([2,0,2], 0)
</code></pre>

<p>The way I would solve this problem is indeed to use a "graph algorithm" â€” something like flood-fill. Start with an array of bools, of the same size as your input array. Color the starting cell <code>True</code>. Then look at the neighbors of that cell. For each neighbor which is currently <code>False</code>, color it <code>True</code> and recurse on it. Eventually you'll run out of <code>False</code> neighbors and the recursion will end. Then check (or during the coloring, check) to see if any of the <code>True</code> (reachable) cells in your array have value <code>0</code>.</p>

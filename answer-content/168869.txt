<p>Go here: <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://validator.w3.org/</a> to check your markup. You can input it directly and it will show all your errors, just go down the list until you deal with them all (luckily, you only have a few). </p>

<p>As for making the code cleaner, I suggest you use ES6 where things like JavaScript template literals can help. Additionally, you can run cleaner looking loops on arrays with:</p>

<pre><code>for (let product of products) {
  if (product.product_id === product_id) {

  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>By the way, note my use of 'strict equality' with the "===" in the 'if' statement? I suggest you go with that unless you have a solid reason not to.</p>

<p>Not that it applies here but there can be issues with onclick; alternatively, you can use event listeners. </p>

<p>You don't specify what kind of browser support you're concerned with but you may want to check out template tags (you can use a script tag for older browsers). This provides a good example:</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template</a></p>

<p>You say your code is "already 100% functional" but you aren't checking any inputs fields. This means anyone can enter any kind of data they want, not good, especially for a shopping cart (try regex). </p>

<p>I would enclose the code in an IIFE:</p>

<pre><code>let myCart = (function() {
   // your code goes here
})()
</code></pre>

<p>Doing so ensures that your code will not be in the global space, thus preventing unforeseen and unwanted collisions.</p>

<p>Edit: I just tried out your example and I suggest that you put the "Add to Cart" button outside of the "Add New Product" display area. In other words, only add to the cart once, in bulk, as opposed to doing it on individual items. As of now, you can end up with a condition where I just removed an item from the upper display, yet...</p>

<p>Fun question;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>you should write a function that takes a parameter instead of just writing the code</p></li>
<li><p>A chessboard has lots of repetition, take a minute to ponder how <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/repeat" rel="nofollow noreferrer">String.repeat</a> could make this code much simpler.</p></li>
<li><p>Your indentation is not perfect, consider using a site like <a href="http://jsbeautifier.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://jsbeautifier.org/</a></p></li>
<li><p>I am not a big fan of <code>var</code> within the loop, I would declare <code>var</code> up front.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This is a possible solution that provides the right size of the board:</p>

<pre><code>function createChessboardString(size){

  const line = ' #'.repeat( size ),
        even = line.substring(0,size),
        odd = line.substring(1,size+1);
  let   out = '';

  while(size--){
    out = out + ((size % 2) ? odd: even ) + '\n';
  }

 return out;
}

console.log(createChessboardString(8));
</code></pre>

<p>You could consider for very large boards that the board in essence repeats 
<code>odd + '\n' + even</code>, so you could <code>repeat</code> that as well. The problem for me is that there are too many corner cases to consider. So personally I would go for the above for any board size &lt; 1000.</p>

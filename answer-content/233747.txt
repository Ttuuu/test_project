<p>There is a bug in this line:</p>

<pre><code>password[i] = symbols[rand() % 26];
</code></pre>

<p><code>symbols</code> is only 21 characters long, so this line triggers undefined behavior when <code>rand() % 26</code> is greater than 21 (and when <code>rand() % 26</code> is exactly 21, it puts a null byte in the password). You meant for this 26 to go with <code>letter</code> instead, and for the 21 to go with <code>symbols</code>.</p>

<p>This would be less likely to happen if you avoid using "magic" numbers. The error is harder to make (or at least, easier to spot) if you write this instead:</p>

<pre><code>password[i] = symbols[rand() % (sizeof symbols - 1)]
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, you can also <code>#define</code> a macro (as Edward's answer also suggests), but I would still define it using <code>sizeof</code>:</p>

<pre><code>#define NUM_SYMBOLS (sizeof symbols - 1)
</code></pre>

<p>Using <code>sizeof</code> to calculate the size, rather than using a literal value like <code>26</code>, ensures that you will not forget to update the count if the size of the array changes.</p>

<p>You're treating comparison of addresses as <em>signed</em> values, instead of <em>unsigned</em>.  For example, after you execute <code>cmp bufferOffset, bufferTail</code>, you use the <code>jge</code> condition, which is <em>jump greater or equal</em>.  This is intended for signed values.  You should use <code>jae</code> <em>jump above or equal</em> instruction instead.  This condition needs to be changed in several places.</p>

<p>Rather than <code>add bufferOffset, 1h</code>, just use <code>inc bufferOffset</code>.</p>

<p>From a readability perspective, having all those leading zeros on you constants makes the actual value a little harder to read, and implies that they could potentially have some value that would be that large.  Since most of those values are character codes, two digits should suffice.</p>

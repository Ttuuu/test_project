<p>Your code formatting deviates from the default Java code formatting, just saying.</p>
<hr>
<pre><code>import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
import javax.swing.*;
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/147454/why-is-using-a-wild-card-with-a-java-import-statement-bad">Wildcard imports are kinda bad</a>. If you can avoid them, please do so.</p>
<hr>
<pre><code>public class Panel extends JPanel
</code></pre>
<p>I'm sure you can find a more descriptive name for this class, like <code>PaintablePanel</code> or <code>MousePaintablePanel</code>.</p>
<hr>
<pre><code>// PROPERTIES
</code></pre>
<p>Personally, I don't like such "structuring" comments, they do nothing and only clutter up the code and need to be manually moved when refactoring automatically.</p>
<hr>
<pre><code>private final int DEFAULT_WIDTH  = 800;
private final int DEFAULT_HEIGHT = 800;
private final Color BACK_COLOR   = Color.WHITE;
</code></pre>
<p>Personally I also don't like this column based alignment, it puts my brain into some sort of "column reading mode" which makes it hard for me to associate the value with the variable.</p>
<hr>
<pre><code>private int x1, y1, x2, y2;
</code></pre>
<p>You should not declare multiple variables on the same line, it makes it easy to miss the declaration of variables.</p>
<hr>
<pre><code>private MyMouseHandler handler;
</code></pre>
<p><code>MyMouseHandler</code> is not a very good name.</p>
<hr>
<pre><code>public void paintComponent(Graphics g)
{
  super.paintComponent(g);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This method seems to override a super method, yet misses the <code>@Override</code> annotation. Also, if it does not do anything, why override it?</p>
<hr>
<pre><code>public void mousePressed( MouseEvent e )
{
...
     SetUpDrawingGraphics();
</code></pre>
<p>Why are you doing this on every mouse press?</p>
<hr>
<pre><code>public class RunPanel
</code></pre>
<p>This is another bad name. What does it run? And it is not a panel.</p>
<hr>
<pre><code>frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(3);
</code></pre>
<p>Any reason why you're not using the constants defined in <code>JFrame</code>?</p>
<hr>

<p>The program works fine, I can draw normal curves at low mouse speed. But again, as I increase the mouse speed the lines/curves start the get jaggy and ugly.</p>

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32172993/how-do-i-fire-mousemotionlistener-events-in-real-time">That is how it is</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have gathered the two classes into one class file and the program stoped the lag. What is causing this?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I see this behavior in both programs. Combining them in the same file has for sure nothing to do with it.</p>

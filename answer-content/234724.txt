<h1>Errors</h1>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Modify variable inside lambda expression:</strong><br>
You sure this code passes compilation? you have a lambda expression (<code>forEach()</code>) that modifies a variable. all variables that are used inside lambda expression are considered <code>final</code>.
by the way, the whole calculation of <code>totalAge</code> can be converted to stream() processing using <code>map()</code> and <code>sum()</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>The <code>switch</code> statement:</strong><br>
there is no <code>break;</code> between the <code>case</code>s, so every female will also be counted as male. </p></li>
</ol>

<h1>Standards</h1>

<ol>
<li><strong>gender:</strong><br>
Any reason why this property has no getter method?</li>
</ol>

<h1>Best Practices</h1>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>equals():</strong><br>
does not protect from <code>NullPointerException</code> or <code>ClassCastException</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use enum :</strong><br>
whenever you have a finite closed set of valid <code>String</code> values. (like gender in your case). the advantages are that the literal value is specified only once, typos are getting detected by the compiler, and you can add properties and behaviors (=methods) to the enum values. in this case, perhaps the display message <code>"Total number of...</code> can be added as property?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Converting array<code>[]</code> to <code>List</code>:</strong><br>
no need to iterate over the array. Use <code>Arrays.asList()</code> .</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Single responsibility principle:</strong><br>
The constructor of <code>CodeReviewTest</code> is doing all the calculations and printing the results. this breaks the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Single responsibility principle</a>. meaning, there are multiple factors that require modifying the code in that one method: adding a new value to gender (yes, it's possible in today PC culture), sending the results in to another destination (for example, storing in DB), there are more.</p></li>
</ol>

<h1>Readability</h1>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Using <code>personsList</code> to hold all females:</strong><br>
This is confusing. imagine you are part of a dev team. your team member might need to modify the code you've written. they will assume that <code>personsList</code> holds all person objects.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Using constructor to perform logic:</strong><br>
constructor has a fixed name that does not say what the method does. it is intended to initialize the object (= populate properties). even if your class has only one method, it is better to have a non constructor method with clear descriptive name. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Comments:</strong><br>
there are none. nough said.</p></li>

<p>Some general stuff:</p>

<p>Your database code is scattered around a bit. You shouldn't be passing back <code>ResultSets</code>. You should execute the query, read the data into a Data Object and return the object (or a list of objects).</p>

<p>You should also use <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18114905/close-connection-and-statement-finally"><code>try</code>-<code>catch</code>-<code>finally</code></a>  OR <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/tryResourceClose.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>try</code>-with-resources</a> to make sure database connections are cleaned up properly.</p>

<p>You shouldn't store the errors in a session. Use a <code>List&lt;String&gt;</code> or <code>String[]</code> to hold error messages and then pass them from the Servlet to the View.</p>

<p>Keep your <code>Database</code> code contained. All your SQL statements in one class. All database operations in one class.  You could have a separate class for each table you are interacting with that all use the utilities of the <code>Database</code> class.</p>

<p>You could also move you logic to 'Service Classes' and call that from the Servlet.</p>

<pre><code>LoginService ls = new LoginService();

ls.validate(username, password, repeatPassword, email);
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>validate</code> method could return a list of errors (empty list means no errors).</p>

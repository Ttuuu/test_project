<p>Your first question "can the board be made more aesthetically pleasing" is subjective, but I would prefer, for only ASCII characters, something like:</p>
<pre><code> X | O | 2 
---+---+---
 3 | X | 5  
---+---+---
 6 | 7 | O 
</code></pre>
<p>But you could make it even more fancier by using <em>Unicode Box-drawing characters</em>, you can copy and paste these from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box-drawing_character" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Wikipedia page 'Box-drawing character'</a>:</p>
<pre><code> X │ O │ 2 
───┼───┼───
 3 │ X │ 5  
───┼───┼───
 6 │ 7 │ O 
</code></pre>
<p>Some other remarks:</p>
<ul>
<li>The function <code>ask_user</code> could be just as good in the main file and renaming it in the import statement to <code>As</code> does not make its use clearer.</li>
<li>You could use a <em>main guard clause</em> to indicate, amongst others, where the main part of the code begins, see for example this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19578308/what-is-the-benefit-of-using-main-method-in-python">StackOverflow Question</a> and links therein.</li>
<li>Think of more descriptive function names, for instance <code>t_Board</code> would be better called <code>print_board</code>.</li>
</ul>

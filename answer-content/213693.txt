<p>Having to manually create the Builder instance with new goes against readability as it clutters the caller's code with knowledge of the Builder class. Explicit new operation binds the code to a certain class. I prefer</p>

<pre><code>Traversal.withSuccessor(...)
    .withPredecessor(currentVertex)
    .withDistance(distance.increment())
    .build();
</code></pre>

<p>...where withSuccessor implicitely creates the Builder instance that corresponds to the meaning of withSuccessor(...). It allows a more readable way for instantiating objects when you have more than one way of instantiation. The Builder is still a public and visible to the caller, but they don't have to import it.</p>

<p>Here are a few suggestions..</p>

<ul>
<li>The Easter day calculation should <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns" rel="nofollow noreferrer">be in its own function</a>.</li>
<li>I would probably put this as a single one liner arrow function (and move it up a few lines) <code>const getSpecificDay = (h, s) =&gt; s.setDate(s.getDate() + (h - s.getDay() % 7));</code>. That just looks cleaner IMO.</li>
<li>You should combine <code>closedDates()</code> and <code>calculateClosedDates()</code> since they're basically both doing the same thing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead of checking the hour every 30 seconds, you're better off calculating the number of milliseconds until the next hour and start checking at that time every hour.</p>

<pre><code>var d = new Date()
d.setHours(d.getHours()+1, 0, 0, 0)
var nextHour = d.getTime() - new Date().getTime();

setTimeout(()=&gt;{
    checkTime();
    setInterval(checkTime, 60*60*1000);
}, nextHour);
</code></pre>

<p>Aside from a few formatting things it looks pretty good man.</p>

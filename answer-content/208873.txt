<p>Hi and welcome to CodeReview.</p>

<p>You are right, your code does not modify state (has not side effects) and the output of the methods depends only from the input... Therefore I would guess that the functions are "pure functions".</p>

<p>However, I would prefere an IEnumerable of int instead of List of int as parameter type because with an IEnumerable the API shows that the method does not change the passed list.</p>

<p>If you value immutability, there are also some immutable collection in .net (e.g.: The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/library/dn467185(v=vs.111).aspx" rel="noreferrer">ImmutableList</a>).</p>

<p>If you like functional programming, F# is really worth a look! <a href="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com" rel="noreferrer">FSharpForFunAndProfit</a> is a good point to start :D</p>

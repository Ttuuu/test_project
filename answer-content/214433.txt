<p>You are handling the exceptions correctly from the look of it. You are just missing the code telling it to throw an exception if the token is cancelled (times out in this case).</p>

<p>Try this. I think it should throw as you expect.</p>

<pre><code>using (var writeCts = new System.Threading.CancellationTokenSource(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10)))
{
    writeCts.Token.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();
    await stream.WriteAsync(messageBytes, 0, messageBytes.Length, writeCts.Token);
    await stream.FlushAsync();  // 2. Do I even need this? I think so. This ensures it has finished writing to the actual hardware.
}
</code></pre>

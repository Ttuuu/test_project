<p>As others have stated, <code>is_prime_number</code> is a bit inefficient, as well as being called <em>a lot</em>.  You might consider caching its result, since it doesn't change.  Try something like:</p>

<pre><code>import functools

@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def is_prime_number(number):
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>And you should see a massive time improvement.</p>

<p>If that's not enough, you're going to have to look into an algorithmic change somewhere.  The immediate construct that jumps out at me is that the loop in <code>is_prime_number</code> is very similar to the loop in <code>sum_prime_factors</code>.  Figuring out how to combine them is likely to be worth your while.</p>

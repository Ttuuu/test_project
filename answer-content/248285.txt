<p>Some of your comments are superfluous, try to express intent in code. Some of your comments also lie.</p>
<p>"checks if the float given is an integer"
What if I didn't pass in a float, should you guard for it?</p>
<p>"False - float is not an integer"
Read that again, that is just nonsense</p>
<p>"finds the greatest common divisor of values"
maybe just call the function greatest_common_divisor and remove the comment</p>
<p>"
return True - yes
return False - no
"
Oh really?</p>
<p>"simplifies a fraction, to a simpler form"
What simple form?</p>
<p>You call one function is_integer with snake case, but another isclose, why not is_close?</p>
<p>"turns a tuple from simplify_sqrt to an actual string representation."
This comment leads be to believe that these functions has to be called in very specific order, in that case, should they instead be put in a class and private and only used by the internal algorithm? What is the public interface of your solver?</p>
<p>"if (not x1 and not x2) or not (is_integer(x1_numer) and is_integer(x2_numer)) or not is_integer(denom)"
Could this be extracted into a function with a better, e.g. if should_factor_by_completing_square(...)</p>
<p>Could completing_the_square not be global and be returned in the response from factor_quadratic_equation ?</p>
<p>Could factor_quadratic_equation be split up into multiple functions, e.g. if should_factor_by_completing_square: factor_by_square(...) else normal_factoring(...)</p>
<p>return "{}({}x{}{})({}x{}{})".format(float_to_int(gcf) if gcf != 1 else "", fraction(x1_denom) if x1_denom != 1 else "", sign1, fraction(x1_numer), fraction(x2_denom) if x2_denom != 1 else "", sign2, fraction(x2_numer))</p>
<p>Way too long a line, split this up, what is happening?</p>

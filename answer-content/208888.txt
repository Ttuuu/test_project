<p>Overall the existence of this code does not seem justified. It seems like boiler paste that doesn't offer a whole lot of new functionality, and people are better off calling requests directly.</p>

<p>It also doesn't make sense as a class. There's enough static content that it should be a module, not a class. It's good that you're thinking about factoring the fallback feature into a common module, but you need to take a different approach.</p>

<p>One thing you can do is make a subclass of <code>requests.Session</code>, but even that doesn't really seem necessary. Things to avoid:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't add logging for stuff that's already logged by requests.</li>
<li>Pass <code>args</code> and <code>kwargs</code> implicitly instead of explicitly copying stuff.</li>
<li>Explicitly pass <code>is_fallback</code> instead of passing it implicitly in <code>kwargs</code>.</li>
<li>Just return the response. Don't convert it to JSON. It's like seven more characters at the calling side, and simplifies everything.</li>
<li>Don't rename <code>request</code> to <code>invoke</code>. Just call it <code>request</code>.</li>
<li>Don't rename <code>url</code> to <code>endpoint</code>. Just call it <code>url</code>.</li>
<li>Don't rename <code>json</code> to <code>json_data</code>. Don't even pass it explicitly. It's quite simple to pass it as <code>json</code> in the <code>kwargs</code>.</li>
<li>Don't set the content type as you are. When requests sees the <code>json</code> kwarg it will do this for you.</li>
</ul>

<p>In my opinion, at the <em>absolute most</em>, you should condense this to one utility method:</p>

<pre><code>import logging
import requests


def request(method, url, is_fallback=False, **kwargs):
    response = requests.request(method, url, **kwargs)
    if is_fallback and response.status_code == 405:
        logging.debug('%s action failed, applying fallback strategy', method)
        return requests.request(method, url, **kwargs)
    return response
</code></pre>

<p>Anything else is unnecessary boilerplate.</p>

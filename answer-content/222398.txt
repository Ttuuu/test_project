<p>I see two major issues when you want to use this code for a MMORPG game.</p>

<h3>Exception Handling</h3>

<p>Make your code robust against connection hick-ups (when connection goes down for a fraction). It's up to be the client to reconnect asap on connection loss (out of scope of your code). The server should dispose client connections on error in order to clean up resources. </p>

<h3>Resource Management</h3>

<p>The server does not care about the number of clients connected, nor does it own the life time scope of these connections.</p>

<p>I would expect the code below to close the connections.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>public void Stop()
{
    _listener.Stop();
    // _connectedClients.ForEach(Disconnect); // cleanup resources
}
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

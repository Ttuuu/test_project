<p>Okay, I don't think you need 8 root level stats collections. Instead one stats collection and create those 8 as sub collections. Keep in mind that you can't query across the sub collections. (Anyway you can't query across the root level collections too. So, you are not losing anything)</p>

<p>Write a cloud function with create trigger. Every time a new game added, update these stats sub collection. Firestore is not great in aggregating. You have to take care of that. </p>

<p>I don't see why you need a graph database for this. If you need to find relationship between players and games, then it could be useful.</p>

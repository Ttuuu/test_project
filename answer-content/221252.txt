<p>Add hysteresis to the unload. That way the unload doesn't happen immediately when the player move out of range where if he dances along the boundary line he could a lot of loading and unloading otherwise.</p>

<pre><code>if (xDistance + zDistance &gt; unloadDistance)
{
    tiles[i].DestroyBundleObject(true);
}
if (xDistance + zDistance &lt; startLoadDistance)
{
    tiles[i].StartDownloadingAB();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also ensure that <code>StartDownloadingAB()</code> can early out and do nothing when the tile is already loaded. </p>

<p>If memory becomes tight you can add the player velocity to the distance logic to prioritize the tiles ahead over the tiles to the side.</p>

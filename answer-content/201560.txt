<ol>
<li><p>in general, I believe it would be better if you included this in some sort of chain. What I mean here:</p>

<ul>
<li>don't return void, rather an <code>Observable</code></li>
<li>don't show the progress dialog in the function, rather delegate it to the part responsible for UI. Same with <code>displayData()</code></li>
<li>where's the whole function called? What calls it? Where is it located, in an Activity?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><code>doOnNext()</code> can be gotten rid of - there's no action in here</p></li>
<li><p>Are you getting just one result at a time? I mean, is the function called perpetually on and on and on, and you just evaluate the result each time? Perhaps you could use <code>Single</code> or <code>Maybe</code>, which is better suited for single results.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Good luck and hope we'll both learn something along the way.</p>

<p>There are two main problems:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Enumerating all combinations, even those that are obviously unbalanced</p></li>
<li><p>The use of floating point calculus in a combinatorics problem</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Re-read the task carefully, especially examples 2 and 3, which hint a better algorithm:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Factorize <code>N</code>. The factors of <code>N=12</code> are <code>[2,3]</code>, which tells us that all tubes are members of either a balanced pair or triplet.</p></li>
<li><p>Find all combinations of factors that sum to <code>K</code>. For <code>N=12, K=10</code>, there are two solutions: <code>2+2+2+2+2=10</code> and <code>2+2+3+3=10</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Find out if the solutions are valid. For <code>N=10, K=7</code> the only solution is <code>2+5=7</code>, which is not valid (see example 3).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>For large values of <code>K</code>, balance holes instead of tubes. So <code>N=12, K=10</code> is the same as <code>N=12, K=2</code>.</p>

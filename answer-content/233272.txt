<p>Start by writing down the use-cases in plain text. What is it that you are designing and how should it work. "It is a noun so it must be a class" is a common mistake. You don't seem to be designing "citizens" but rather mail lists. </p>

<p>So the class here should perhaps be <code>MailList</code>, which can contain a list of registered citizens. One instance of the mail list per contender, contender probably doesn't need to be a class, meaning you'll have a <code>MailList</code> array the size of the number of contenders. There's no direct relation between citizen and contender that motivates inheritance or polymorphism.</p>

<p>You can have a citizen class still, but it would be a pretty "dumb" one only containing name and e-mail address. Or possibly just the e-mail address, in which case a class isn't needed and it can be a string.</p>

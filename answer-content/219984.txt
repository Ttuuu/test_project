<p>You can get the value for <code>ASCII_POS_OF_0</code> easily by using <code>'0'</code>. </p>

<p>Your code doesn't deal with malformed strings well.</p>

<p>If the string is only <code>"123"</code> it will attempt to read beyond the contents of the string. You can fix this by checking for <code>'\0'</code> at the correct places.</p>

<p>It also doesn't handle any type of whitespace in the string at all.</p>

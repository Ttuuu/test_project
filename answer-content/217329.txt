<p><a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/217297/153986">@AJNeufeld's Answer</a> covers all of the logical review quite effectively, but I would like to add a note on your naming schemes.</p>

<p>As it stands calling your current code would look something like:</p>

<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>ArrayLeftRotation.LeftRotation(source, /*some number*/a)
</code></pre>

<p>It would be significanly more succinct to rename the Class from ArrayLeftRotation to RotateArray or even Rotate, and the simply rename your LeftRotation method left() (using lowercase method names as mentioned in above answer)</p>

<p>Your new call looks much cleaner as:</p>

<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>Rotate.left(source, /*some number*/ a)
</code></pre>

<p>This also offers a built in symmetry should you extend the code to rotate the opposite direction, as such a call would be similar: <code>Rotate.right()</code></p>

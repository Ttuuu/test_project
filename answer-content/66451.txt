<p><code>neg_or_pos</code> is a terrible function name.</p>

<p>A function name should generally be a verb or a verbal phrase. And, even if you made it a predicate as <code>is_neg_or_pos</code> it should always return <code>True</code>, as the fraction surely is negative or positive.</p>

<p>By making it <code>is_negative</code> or <code>is_positive</code>, you make your code a lot clearer. I would not know what a <code>True</code> result from <code>is_neg_or_pos</code> meant without reading the source, and predicate methods are generally really straightforward.</p>

<p>Your class has a memory leak: both the form object and the associated event handler object will never get cleared by the garbage collector (well, I'm not 100% sure on where the reference to <code>EventHandlerManager</code> gets stored, but I'm sure it doesn't get cleared and thus the form object doesn't get cleared).</p>

<p>I outlined <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/53011097/7296893">here</a> on Stack Overflow how you can get reference loops on forms in Microsoft Access because the form object doesn't get deallocated when the form closes if there are open references to it.</p>

<p>Your reference loop works in the following way: the form has a reference to the class <code>EventHandlerManager</code>, <code>EventHandlerManager</code> has a reference to <code>EH_TextBox</code> and <code>EH_ComboBox</code>, <code>EH_ComboBox</code> and <code>EH_Textbox</code> have a reference to the form.</p>

<p>There are several ways to deal with this. One is to listen to form events in your <code>EH_Textbox</code> and <code>EH_ComboBox</code> classes, and remove the reference to the form on the <code>Form_Unload</code> event. However, I'd break the loop in the <code>EventHandlerManager</code> class to avoid redundant code.</p>

<p><strong>EventHandlerManager.cls</strong></p>

<pre><code>Private WithEvents m_frm As Access.Form

Public Sub initFormHandlers(p_form As Form)
    Set m_frm = p_form
    m_frm.OnUnload = "[Event Procedure]"
    'Your existing code
End Sub

Private Sub Form_Unload(Cancel As Integer)
    'Release event handler collections
    Set m_TextBoxes = Nothing
    Set m_ComboBoxes = Nothing
End Sub
</code></pre>

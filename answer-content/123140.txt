<p>Follow <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229043" rel="nofollow">standard naming conventions</a>: <code>private void LoadWords(string fileLocation)</code> - same for the rest of your methods.</p>

<p>In <code>private void guessLetter(char letter)</code> there is the following code:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>if (amountOfLettersRevealed == word.Length)
{
    wordRevealed = true;
    gameWon();
}
if (wrongGuesses == MAX_WRONG_GUESSES)
{
    gameOver();
}
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Presumably if <code>amountOfLettersRevealed == word.Length</code> then <code>wrongGuesses != MAX_WRONG_GUESSES</code>? In that case it seems to make more sense to use <code>else if</code>, rather than evaluating the second expression even if the first is true. (Why would you call <code>gameWon()</code> and then check if you lost too?)</p>

<p>Also I think that code should not be in that method at all. The method is called <code>guessLetter</code>. It should handle the logic of guessing the letter. Checking whether the player has won or lost is not "guessing the letter".</p>

<p>Also it seems strange to have the <code>letter_Click</code> call a <code>buttonClicked</code> method. Initially I thought that was the button's click event handler due to the similarity between this method's name and the default name for a click event handler for a nameless button. I would maybe call that method <code>UpdateButtonBackground</code> or whatever that describes what that method actually does, since it's not an event handler.</p>

<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>May I suggest a 50% reduction in runtime/effort?  </p>

<pre><code>Dim row As Integer
For row = 1 To 10 'let's say there is 10 rows
    If StrComp("Admin",Cells(row, 1).Value,vbTextCompare) Then
        Cells(row, 2).Value = "Exploitation"
    End If
Next row
</code></pre>

<p>Did nobody notice that the OP talks about "checking ONE column, writing to the NEXT adjacent", really? Why loop columns then? The second pass would only check either an empty cell or one with "Exploitation" in it.</p>
    </div>

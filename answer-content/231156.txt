<p>A few things I see:</p>

<p>The subtraction(<code>-</code>) operator would make more sense to return a <code>Date</code> object instead of an <code>int</code>.  This would also fit in with standard practice.  If such a function is needed, I would suggest naming a specific function for that,<code>DiffDays</code> perhaps.  This has the advantage being more intuitive for the user.</p>

<p>Instead of requiring each instance of the <code>Date</code> object to require the user calling <code>Set</code>, it would be more intuitive to overload the constructor.</p>

<p>It seems to me that returning a <code>string</code> instead of a <code>char*</code> would be more in fitting with a c++ program.</p>

<p>In general, your program is very C-like. I would raise at least the following points:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When writing C++, you might prefer <code>std::cout</code> to <code>printf</code>. Some points regarding this are raised for instance in <a href="//stackoverflow.com/q/2017489">this SO question</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>In contrast to C, when writing C++, you should strive to declare variables as late as possible. This increases readability and advocates efficiency (e.g., if you exit early, was it really worth initializing all those gazillion variables?). For example, don't define <code>keyFile</code> and <code>outFile</code> at the beginning of Encrypt; it's not their place of use. As a C++ programmer, if I see something like <code>keyFile</code> being used, I instinctively look for its type somewhere nearby, perhaps only to discover I have to scroll up considerably before finding it making it harder to understand the code. </p></li>
<li><p>Luckily, C++ offers classes which do dynamic memory management for you. Instead of using an array of characters (like <code>char key[100]</code>), consider using <code>std::string</code>. With a character array, you have to take care in not overflowing (is 100 characters really sufficient? What happens if not?).</p></li>
<li><p>Consider avoiding manual memory management via <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code>. Mistakes are easy to make and notoriously hard to catch in larger &amp; more complex systems. Tools like <code>std::shared_ptr</code> and <code>std::vector</code> are specifically designed to help you in these cases.</p></li>
</ul>

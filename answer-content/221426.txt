<blockquote>
<pre><code>//creating cimsession to remote host
CimSession session = await Task.Run(() =&gt;
{
     return CimSession.Create(computerHostName);
});
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p><code>Task.Run</code> is a red flag. This should be</p>

<pre><code>CimSession session = await CimSession.CreateAsync(computerHostName);
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly for every method you call on <code>session</code> which has a <code>...Async</code> version, you should use the <code>...Async</code> version.</p>

<hr>

<p>It seems that you're calling this from a GUI thread. That means you need to be careful about where your continuations are executed. I would suggest pulling the async calls out into a method and using <code>.ConfigureAwait(false)</code> on all of them, and then calling that method from the GUI thread with <code>ContinueWith(...)</code> to update the GUI, but since you refuse to provide more context I can't be more specific.</p>

<p>I can't say for sure what the interviewer thought, but here are some things that could be improved:</p>

<p><strong>1) Use appropriate data types</strong></p>

<p>CountryList is acceptable, but Container should be a class, not a tuple that requires referring to the (hopefully correct) comment to see what data get&lt;1&gt; is referring to.  </p>

<p>And what is ContainerList even indexing by?  Based on the code, it appears to be the price, but I can only tell that from how it's being constructed in main.  And it's not clear why this is a multimap by price rather than a vector.  </p>

<p>Edit: On further inspection, I see that's being used for the sorting to give the high-cost items priority.  Since this is a concern of the algorithm rather than the caller, it shouldn't be the format that's provided as a parameter - rather SelectContainers should take a vector or iterator range and then sort it internally.</p>

<p>Several of these typedefs are just used internally within SelectContainers, so they shouldn't be defined globally.</p>

<p><strong>2) Interface design</strong></p>

<p>SelectContainers should return a list of results that another method can print (or use in other ways), not do the printing itself.</p>

<p>Having flexibility via SearchCriteria doesn't help if you don't have a way for the user of the function to change it.  Make a SearchCriteria a parameter.</p>

<p>SearchCriteria should take the filters as a constructor parameter; the current usage where it fails everything by default until filters are added is unintuitive.</p>

<p><strong>3) Spelling and formatting</strong></p>

<p>There are a number of misspellings and inconsistent formatting.  Understandable if this was done in a short time frame, but people do judge on that.  </p>

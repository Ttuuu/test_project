<p>In an interview setting it is quite hard to come with an efficient solution (unless you happen to be very good in mental multiplication; however a <span class="math-container">\$99 * 91\$</span> example is a strong hint). The key to an efficient solution is an observation that</p>

<p><span class="math-container">\$999999 * 999001 = 999000000999\$</span></p>

<p>is a quite large palindromic product. It means that you don't have to test the entire 6-digit ranges of multiplicands. It is enough to test multiplicands only in <span class="math-container">\$[999001.. 999999]\$</span> range. Just <span class="math-container">\$10^6\$</span> candidate pairs rather than <span class="math-container">\$10^{12}\$</span>.</p>

<p>BTW, a similar identity holds for products of longer numbers as well.</p>

<p>Next, you may notice that there are just one thousand palindromic numbers larger than <span class="math-container">\$999000000999\$</span> (they are in form of <code>999abccba999</code>), and to qualify as a solution is must have a 6-digit factor larger than <span class="math-container">\$999001\$</span>. This implies the following algorithm (in pseudocode):</p>

<pre><code>base = 999000000999
abc = 999
while abc &gt;= 0
    cba = reverse_digits(abc)
    number = base + abc * 1000000 + cba * 1000
    for factor in 999001 to sqrt(number)
        if number % factor == 0:
           return number
    abc -= 1
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>reverse_digits</code> of a 3-digit number could be done extremely fast (a lookup table, for example). Still a <span class="math-container">\$10^6\$</span> or so rounds, but no expensive tests for palindromicity.</p>

<p>All that said, since the problem stems from <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=4" rel="noreferrer">Project Euler #4</a> it is possible that it admits a more elegant number-theoretical solution.</p>

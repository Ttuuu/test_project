<p>Your Insert is wrong, you have to do it the same way as the Remove with shifting Elements. ArrayIndex is not increased to decreased on Remove/Insert. </p>

<p>Better don't call any parameter a parameter or add the DataType to it. Name as you speak. You insert an 'item' or an 'element' to your list. Not a parameter.</p>

<p>Always Doubling the array on overflow can lead to very huge arrays. Imagine you have a 1 Gigabyte Array and you want to add 1 element,you allocate 1 new gigabyte for that.
It's better to increase by a fixed amount of items, like 16 or may 1024.</p>

<p>Why do you have to have two Array.Copy on reallocation ?
Usual approach is to create a new array and copy existing elements.</p>

<pre><code>var tmp = new T[newarraylength];
Array.Copy(arrayList, tmp, oldarraylength);
arrayList = tmp;
</code></pre>

<p>I don't get why you copy something twice.</p>

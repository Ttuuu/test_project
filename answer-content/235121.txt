<p>I did not bother to read your test code in detail, as that code looks totally unexpected to me.</p>

<p>In the test for a sudoku solver there must be at least one full example sudoku that is solved and validated.</p>

<p>The test must not depend on external files and it must not run external programs since a sudoku solver gets an incomplete sudoku board as input and returns a complete sudoku board as output. That's all.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://github.com/rillig/Phantom-Go-Android/blob/327ddd514779606fe13a742150bb1da0d26aae45/app/src/test/java/de/roland_illig/phantomgo/BoardTest.kt#L7" rel="nofollow noreferrer">completely unrelated project</a> I have some code that demonstrates how simple a unit test can be, and how the code can almost disappear behind the actually interesting test data.</p>

<p>Regarding your main code: it is bad style to have several <code>static</code> methods that all operate on a two-imensional <code>int</code> array. It's much better to define a data type called <code>Sudoku</code> that encapsulates and hides the array. That way your code can concentrate on solving sudokus instead of dealing with the low-level array terminology.</p>

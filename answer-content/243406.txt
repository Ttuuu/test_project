<p>Some Basic things i would like to mention here</p>

<p><strong>1. Why did you use Wrapper class Integer</strong>
when you had to create array of integer you have option of int[] or Integer[],
for using wrapper classes you should have reasons to use it, please read the use cases of wrapper class</p>

<p><strong>2. Variable names</strong>
Always give your variable meaningful name, because it is not just about writing the code but also the maintainability and readability of code.</p>

<p><strong>3. Your calculateAvg() method</strong>
Why are you accessing main class here, you have array to get the size(which is equal to the number of subject)</p>

<p><strong>4. While taking input subject marks</strong>
Directly use int[] not list, that way you need not do the conversation from list to array.</p>

<p><strong>5. enum for the grade</strong>
you can use enum for the grade that way you will not have constants in your code base.</p>

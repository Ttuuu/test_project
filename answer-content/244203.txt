<li>I don't think exposing the Node class is useful. It should probably be mostly an internal class within your class (or at least package/namespace)</li>
<li><code>Node</code> could be using generics, so <code>Node&lt;T&gt;</code> instead of always having an <code>int</code></li>
<li>At least some of your <code>AddNode</code>-methods could simply be called <code>Add</code> instead. Because they're actually adding a number, a list of numbers, or something else that is not exactly a <code>Node</code>.</li>
<li>Think about the current time complexity of <code>AddNodes(IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; value)</code> and think about if it's possible to improve it somehow. <em>(Hint: Yes, it is. A single <code>AddNode</code> operation gets more and more costly the more you add, but adding a bunch of them at the same time could be almost as cheap as simply adding just one)</em></li>
<li><code>OnlyOneNodeNull</code> can be simplified by using the XOR operator: <code>lhs.Next == null ^ rhs.Next == null</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, good job :)</p>

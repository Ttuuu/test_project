<p>I find neither of your solutions very pythonic. </p>

<p>Using sum to concatenate lists seems like a hack.</p>

<p>Using reduce looks better but still has the problem of making the selection too verbose to read it fast.</p>

<p>The last one is far too much. Understanding what it does takes way too long.</p>

<p>Actually the problem you are solving is two subproblems:</p>

<ol>
<li>taking a list of samples from the choices collection </li>
<li>flattening the resulting list</li>
</ol>

<p>So the code should be more like</p>

<pre><code>flatten(samples(choices, sequence))
</code></pre>

<p>I am no regular user of python so I can't tell you much about library implementations of <code>flatten</code> and <code>samples</code> but I am quite sure that there are many implementations around on the net (not necessarily under these names though).</p>

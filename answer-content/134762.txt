<h2>Variable capitalization</h2>

<p>IT IZ PRETTY GUD LOLCODE<br>
HOWEVEZ ME THINKS THAT TEH LOLCODEZ R EZYR 2 READ IF TEH VARZ R lowercase<br>
ZIS BECUZ ALL CAPS IS HARD TOO READ<br>
<sub>(all spelling "mistakes" made by my cat, who assisted me in that part of this review)</sub></p>

<p>More seriously, it is an issue that there are no good LOLCODE syntax highlighters. To be "stylish" and keep everything uppercase is a choice you can make, but personally I prefer to use lowercase or camelCase variable names whilst keeping the language constructs all caps. Similar to SQL, this allows you to see what parts of the code are variables, and what parts are language constructs.</p>

<h2>Variable naming</h2>

<p>Regarding <code>NUMAH</code>, have you considered using <code>NUMBAH</code>? Similar meaning, but uses a more common mispronunciation.</p>

<h2>Working around the spec</h2>

<pre><code>IM IN YR LOOPZ NERFIN YR COWNTR TIL BOTH SAEM COWNTR AN DIFF OF 1 AN NUMAH
  NAUW R SUM OF NUMAH AN COWNTR
</code></pre>

<p>This construct is non-obvious. You had to work around the spec to do something that you wanted to do, and I think it warrants explanation. Add a comment via <code>BTW</code>:</p>

<pre><code>IM IN YR LOOPZ NERFIN YR COWNTR TIL BOTH SAEM COWNTR AN DIFF OF 1 AN NUMAH
  NAUW R SUM OF NUMAH AN COWNTR BTW workaround loop counters starting at 0
</code></pre>

<h2>Correctness in corner cases</h2>

<p>Your function doesn't check if the value passed in is greater than 0. This means that it falsely forces a KITTEH to break their paw when it wasn't necessary.</p>

<p>Add a guard clause at the top of the function; you can do an early return via <code>GTFO</code>.</p>

<pre><code>DIFFRINT numbah AN BIGGR OF numbah AN 0
O RLY? YA RLY
    GTFO
OIC
</code></pre>

<h2>Program definition</h2>

<pre><code>OBTW
    PRINT TEH LOLCODE VERSHUN OV N BOTTLEZ OV BER ON TEH WALL.
TLDR

HAI 1.3
</code></pre>

<p>Aside from the weird phrasing (does this code print the lolcode version of/and bottles of beer on the wall?), there's something else wrong here: Your comment is before the <code>HAI 1.3</code>. So any interpreter loading your file might not know what version you are using. Put your version number at the top. </p>

<h2>Possible alternative dialects</h2>

<pre><code>VISIBLE "NO MOAR LITTERs OV KITTEHS ON TEH NETZ"
</code></pre>

<p>Did you make a typo here, is this an alternative kitty dialect that uses lower case 's' for certain plurals? I'm not sure.</p>

<hr>

<p>Lastly, I think this version of 99 LITTERS OV KITTEHS ON TEH NETZ is not authentic, as anyone knows that when KITTEHS fall, they'll be alright. This version is sad, as all the KITTEHS just break their paws. Proper LOLCODE uses cats, it doesn't <em>abuse</em> them.</p>

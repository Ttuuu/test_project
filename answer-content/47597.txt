<p>Few notes.</p>

<ul>
<li>All algorithms on ranges are much simpler if the range is considered semi-open (that is, <code>right</code> is just beyond the last interesting element.</li>
<li>The <code>While l &lt; r</code> loop does a very important job; important enough to factor it into a separate function, <code>Public Sub Partition</code></li>
<li>One more thing you want to do is to eliminate a last tail-recursive call to quicksort. It is very well possible that the compiler will do it for you; still it is better to be explicit.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Performance</h3>

<p>Time complexity for your algorithm is <span class="math-container">\$O(N²+N²/2)\$</span>. If you find a way to combine <code>Transpose</code> <span class="math-container">\$O(N²)\$</span> and <code>ReverseCols</code> <span class="math-container">\$O(N²/2)\$</span> in a single run, you could get <span class="math-container">\$O(N²)\$</span> in worst case.</p>

<p>Edit: given Henrik's good eye, you have already come up with a solution before that adheres to the optimized complexity. So, apply it here.</p>

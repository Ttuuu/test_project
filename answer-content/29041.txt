<p>You could initialize the capacity of the lists (via the constructor) you are generating. The closer you can get to the size the list will be after all points are added the better. </p>

<p>The reason you would do this is that the list implementation is just a wrapper around an array starting at some size. Every time you add an item to the list it first checks to see if the array has enough space and, if not, it will create a new larger array, copy the contents from the array that is full, and add your new item. It is pretty standard for the size of the array to double each time it is resized. The resizing is expensive, so setting the capacity to something close to the total number of items that it will contain can improve performance.</p>

<p>Also, be sure not to set the capacity too high, you can end up wasting a good bit of memory that way (if that is a concern.)</p>

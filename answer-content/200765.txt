<p>Good job!</p>

<p>I would personally prefer to use f-strings, which are more readable.</p>

<pre><code># from
print('Price: $%s'%(prices[fruit]))
# to
print(f'Price: ${prices[fruit]}')
</code></pre>

<p>Using newlines ('\n') would save you from using that many prints and make your code more readable. </p>

<p>Four spaces (instead of two) for indentation would also show your awareness of the PEP8 style conventions</p>

<p>Try/Except structure (catching errors of a particular type)  is more preferable and is considered as Pythonic way (refer to <a href="https://docs.python-guide.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python-guide.org/</a>).</p>

<p>Use dict.get(). refer to: <a href="https://docs.quantifiedcode.com/python-anti-patterns/correctness/not_using_get_to_return_a_default_value_from_a_dictionary.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.quantifiedcode.com/python-anti-patterns/correctness/not_using_get_to_return_a_default_value_from_a_dictionary.html</a></p>

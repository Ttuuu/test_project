<p>Never swallow exceptions silently like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>} catch (ClientProtocolException e) {
    } catch (IOException e) {
}
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>You'll have a nasty time debugging hidden problems because of that.  At the very least, print some diagnostic message to <code>System.err</code>.  Furthermore, you couldn't responsibly continue trying to parse an incomplete result, so you should abort the processing instead.</p>

<p>Basically, if you don't know what to do with an exception, you should probably propagate it.  In fact, you already declared that <code>getLocationInfo()</code> can throw an <code>IOException</code>, so why bother catching <code>IOException</code> at all?</p>

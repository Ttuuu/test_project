<p>Two things to add:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I'd print that response code here to the log:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>log.severe(entries + " **unknown response code**.");
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>It would help debugging.</p></li>
<li><p>Retry seems a good idea first but one of the recent Java Posse episode (<a href="http://javaposse.com/java-posse-442" rel="nofollow">#442 Roundup â€˜13 - Big Data Bloopers</a>) has an interesting thought: This might not be that you really want. If there's a problem on the other side it might just makes the thing worse and it probably performs a DoS attack.</p></li>

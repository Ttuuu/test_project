<p>Agreed, sorting is easiest to simplify the code.
To guarantee exactly three, you would call something like <code>int numArr = new int[]{8,6,7}; consecutive(3, numArr);</code> using this method:</p>

<pre><code>public static boolean consecutive(int count, int... numbers) {
    if (numbers.length != count) {//make sure the correct number of numbers was sent in
        return false;
    }
    Arrays.sort(numbers);//guarantee order to simplify logic

    for (int i = 1; i &lt; numbers.length; i++) {
        //compare this num to the previous num, make sure its exactly 1 greater
        if (numbers[i] != numbers[i - 1] + 1) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
</code></pre>
    </div>

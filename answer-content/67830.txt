<p>Given that the objective of the program is to waste time, I'm not sure that time efficiency is the thing to optimize for :P</p>

<p>As far as anything else goes though there's room for improvement. I think that a <code>for</code> loop makes more sense in this particular case.</p>

<pre><code>for(int k = 0; k &lt; 10; k++)
{
    cout &lt;&lt; "\nEnter any number other than 5: ";
    cin &gt;&gt; UserNumber;

    if (UserNumber == 5)
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; "\n\n\nHey! You weren't supposed to enter 5!\n\n\n";
        exit(0);
    }
}

cout &lt;&lt; "Wow, you're more patient then I am, you win.\n\n\n";
exit(0);
</code></pre>
    </div>

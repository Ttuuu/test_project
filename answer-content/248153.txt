<p>First, don't write to disk anything you don't need to. It's not entirely clear what your goal is here, but I fail to see why you would have such a need in the first place.</p>
<p>That said, if you take your send function in a vacuum, what it does right now is:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Read your whole (as you say) large file in memory</p>
</li>
<li><p>For each chunk, you allocate a whole new array, copy the chunk over, put a <code>MemoryStream</code> on top of it and then send it over.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That is not how streaming is done.</p>
<p>Instead, you should open a file stream without reading anything, then loop over it for as many chunks as you need and read each chunk individually in one pre-allocated buffer (don't keep allocating new byte arrays), get the base64 representation if you really need it, and send the chunk, then keep looping. Your garbage collector will thank you.</p>

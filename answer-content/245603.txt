<p><code>DownloadTGZFile</code> does two things, which is one thing too many.</p>
<ul>
<li>It does what it name says it does (download a .TGZ file),</li>
<li>but it also unpacks the TGZ file, and that is not in the method's name.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unpacking the file should be a different method. You should then have a new method that calls both methods.</p>
<hr>
<p>Also, please follow <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/capitalization-conventions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the Microsoft guidelines</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The PascalCasing convention, used for all identifiers except parameter
names, <strong>capitalizes the first character of each word (including
acronyms over two letters in length)</strong>, as shown in the following
examples:</p>
<p><code>PropertyDescriptor HtmlTag</code></p>
<p>A special case is made for two-letter acronyms in which both letters
are capitalized, as shown in the following identifier:</p>
<p><code>IOStream</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus the method name should be <code>DownloadTgzFile</code>.</p>

<p>Your function <code>is_prime</code> is extremely inefficient perfomance wise called every time you want to check for prime numbers (especially for larger ranges).<br>
You're going to loop over all the values and check every time it's called.</p>

<p>You should rather consider to implement a memoizing algorithm like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Sieve of Erasthotenes</a> to check for prime numbers in 1st place to improve the overall performance.</p>

<p>From the code snippet shown, I would say if the amount of data (ads) in total is not very large. The service code should simply : get all data. In another word, make HTTP request. </p>

<p>The filtering logic should be in another typescript/Javascript. One function should take the column/field it tries to filter as a parameter and return data set.</p>

<p>The advantage of Angular or AngularJS is that the UI can react very fast to user input. Maybe you want to have 1 dropdown for selecting cities, 1 dropdown for selecting categories. And then a input field for search. And these logic wouldn't be in the service code. It will be in a component. </p>

<p>In the scenario where data set is very large, the filtering for cities or categories can happen in the middle tier. </p>

<p>The logic you have currently, you are repeating a lot. For example, multiple if statement has <code>this.routeParameters.search === 'search'</code></p>

<p>Instead of checking:  <code>if(ABC), if(A!BC), if(AB!C), if(A!B!C)</code>, try <code>if(A){ check for b and c here }</code></p>

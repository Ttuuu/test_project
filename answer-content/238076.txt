<p>The name <code>is_divisible</code> could be better.<br>
As is, the leading <code>is_</code> makes it look like something that you would use as a test.<br>
e.g. <code>if is_divisible(â€¦):</code></p>

<p>Why is <code>output</code> a list?  Wouldn't a string be easier?</p>

<p>The multiple <code>num +1</code> looks awkward.</p>

<p>Normally I'd suggest assigning the result to another variable, but in this case the problem is with the <code>range(100)</code>.  Instead, say <code>range(1,101)</code>, and then use just <code>num</code>.</p>

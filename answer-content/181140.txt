<p>Here is my suggestion to make it more object-oriented:</p>

<p><code>log_init()</code> should return a handle, which is passed in subsequent calls to <code>logd()</code>, <code>loge()</code>, etc. In other words, there should be no global, static data in the .c file:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Bundle all types of static variables into a struct (i.e. "class" in OOP parlance)</p></li>
<li><p><code>log_init()</code> dynamically creates and initializes a struct and returns a pointer to it (i.e. the handle mentioned above, "constructor" in OOP parlance)</p></li>
<li><p>All other logging functions must take a pointer to that struct type as first argument (i.e. "instance" or "object" in OOP parlance, e.g. "this"-pointer in C++)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This design decouples code and data and makes it possible to create multiple logging instances which are independent of each other.</p>

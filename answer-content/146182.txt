<p>The time for the approach you gave is in <span class="math-container">\$O(n ^ 2)\$</span>.</p>

<p><strong>Details about a possible solution</strong></p>

<p>This is Klee's measure problem for <span class="math-container">\$d = 2\$</span>.</p>

<p>Apparently, an optimal algorithm for this case exists and is called Bentley's algorithm. Its running time is <span class="math-container">\$O(n \cdot \log(n))\$</span>. However, it seems that the 1977 paper that describes it is unavailable. It uses sweep-line approach and a dynamic 1-d segment tree.</p>

<p>We have <span class="math-container">\$n\$</span> axis-aligned rectangles. Our sweep-line moves across <span class="math-container">\$x\$</span>. We have events along <span class="math-container">\$x\$</span> that correspond to start of rectangle and end of rectangle. The intersection of the sweep-line with a collection of rectangles is essentially a 1-d measure problem. We have <span class="math-container">\$2 \cdot n\$</span> events with at most <span class="math-container">\$2 \cdot n\$</span> distinct x values. We use a 1-d segment tree that we maintain via inserts and deletes to give 1-d measure that we "pull" with delta-<span class="math-container">\$x\$</span>'s to give incremental contributions to 2-d measure. The costly operations are sort and insert/delete.</p>

<p>Higher dimensions are more difficult to handle. We might then be better served by using higher-dimensional segment tree with intersection queries or an R-tree variant with intersection queries. This would depend on which is larger -- <span class="math-container">\$d\ \cdot \log(n)\$</span> or <span class="math-container">\$\log^{\textrm{max}(d - 1, 1)}(n)\$</span> for <span class="math-container">\$d \geq 1\$</span> -- the former being smaller may imply that R-tree is better; the latter (i.e. we note that this time is with fractional cascading) being smaller implies segment tree is better.</p>

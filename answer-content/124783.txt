<p>I think you could exit a little more cleanly.  One is to just do</p>

<pre><code>sys.exit("Something bad happened")
</code></pre>

<p>While the other is to do</p>

<pre><code>print "Something bad happened"
sys.exit(SOMETHING_BAD_ERRCODE)
</code></pre>

<p>The first saves a somewhat meaningless line, while the second would help automated tools (maybe you want to script it and do something different depending on why it fails).  Additionally, error messages should probably be printed to standard error instead of standard output (I often like to pipe the outputs to different files/streams).</p>

<p>I also think you put a little too much in this block</p>

<pre><code>try:
    body = m['items'][0]['body_markdown']
except KeyError:
    print "Error: item list was empty; bad question number?"
    sys.exit()
except IndexError:
    print "Error: response does not contain markdown; bad question number?"
    sys.exit()
</code></pre>

<p>It is unclear to me which part is supposed to raise which error, and I think making it more explicit and putting each step into its own <code>try...except</code> would be easier to understand.</p>

<p>I also don't like how you swallow the error entirely - it might be helpful to actually see the traceback.  Maybe enable some <code>-v</code> mode to show full error output?</p>

<p>Additionally, it may be worthwhile to use <code>argparse</code> (or similar) to handle the CLI - this makes it easier to specify the CLA and will also make future enhancements easier, and will also be more readily understandable by people reading your code.</p>

<p>Is the camera a global entity?  Will the only ever be just one?</p>

<p>Perhaps, but perhaps not. You can have two or more viewpoints shown in multiple viewports.  You might use shadow mapping, which positions a camera at a light source for rendering a shadow map.</p>

<p>If you are thinking of a generic “mouse controller” for a camera, which you can reuse in multiple applications, I’d shy away from the global camera. </p>

<p>If you are working on a one of a kind application, have no intention of reusing the code, will only ever use one point-of-view, and needs the minuscule speed gain and reduction of complexity of not passing a pointer to the camera around to functions as required, a global camera is fine. </p>

<p>From your question and code, I understand that you are trying to</p>
<ul>
<li>consume events from Kafka topic, persist in MongoDB.</li>
<li>Also, exposing api's to retrieve data from Mongo DB and send in response.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this is the case, solution above looks Good, as you are considering MongoDB as a source of truth/primary DB.</p>
<p>you can also persist data in Kafka as a cache and use configure API's to get data from Kafka. (Refer KTable, GlobalKTable).</p>

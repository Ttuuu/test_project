<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>The word "hundred" doesn't belong in the <code>Tens</code> array:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is the only element in the array that starts with a space</li>
<li>It is only accessed at one place in the code</li>
<li>It is never accessed from the place in the code where the other elements are accessed</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore it is better to either:</p>

<ul>
<li>Declare it as a single string variable</li>
<li>Just use the string <code>" hundred"</code> literally, directly in the one place where it is needed</li>
</ul>

<p>Another strange thing is that the <code>dash</code> variable contains a dash in most cases but sometimes also contains nothing at all. In the latter case its variable name <code>dash</code> doesn't accurately describe what the variable contains. Rename it to <code>separator</code> or <code>sep</code> instead.</p>

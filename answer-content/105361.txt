<p>Instead of filtering through your array 3 times, you could use a single loop and increment counters. This makes for less beautiful code but it is much more practical.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you could simply filter twice and calculate the last <code>count</code> by substracting the two filter results from your total count :</p>

<pre><code>from __future__ import division

N = int(raw_input())
ary = map(int, raw_input().split())

count_negatives = len(filter(lambda x: x &lt; 0, ary))
count_positives = len(filter(lambda x: x &gt;0, ary))
count_zeros = N - count_negatives - count_positives

print count_positives / N
print count_negatives / N
print count_zeros / N
</code></pre>

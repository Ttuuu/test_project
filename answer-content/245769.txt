<p>OK. Let's start with some basics, "entities" are just sub-classes - what you really want is aggregate to talk to each other.</p>
<p>In simple terms.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>AggregateA</p>
<ul>
<li>EntityA1</li>
<li>EntityA2</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>AggregateB</p>
<ul>
<li>EntityB1</li>
<li>EntityB2</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Then...</p>
<p>Only aggregates get to talk / interact with other aggregates.
For example...
Duncan [my name], is an aggregate of a person, I have entities, like a RightArm entity, a LeftArm entity.</p>
<p>If I got to a Shop, a Shop is an aggregate of many entities.</p>
<p>"So Duncan aggregate interacts with a Shop aggregate."</p>
<p><strong>Side Point</strong>
Shop has value objects... eg. Number of fork candles for sale.
Duncan has value object of... cash to spend.</p>
<hr>
<p>In your terms, there is two aggregates...</p>
<ul>
<li>Player</li>
<li>Game</li>
</ul>
<p>Player, has tokens.
Game has player(s).</p>
<p>Then work out, how they interact, I'd say Game.Start(player1)?</p>

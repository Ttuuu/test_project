<ul>
<li>Do not forget to close the <code>scanner</code></li>
<li>No need for obvious comments, try to comment why not what, we understand what already</li>
<li>Why do you have the empty <code>else;</code> ?</li>
<li>Be consistent using <code>println</code>, no need for + "\n"</li>
<li>Make use of <code>printf</code></li>
<li>Use loops or methods instead of copy / paste</li>
<li>Your last condition is always <code>true</code>, add tests to your apps</li>
<li><code>if (bottles == 1)</code> but no sad face for 0 bottles? It is even worse.. </li>
<li>Initialise / introduce variables just before you need them, not somewhere irrelevant (see how I moved <code>double total = (bottles * litre);</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is what I have after applying the changes..</p>

            double litre = sc.nextDouble();

            System.out.print("How many bottles have you drunk today? : ");
            double bottles = sc.nextDouble();

                System.out.println("You've only drunk one bottle today! :(");

            } else if (total &gt;= 4) {
                System.out.println("Good job! You've drunk enough water today! :)");
            }

            for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {
                TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(1);
                System.out.print(".");
            }

            System.out.println("Did you like our little app? Please review it from 1-5. 1 being considerer as very good and 5 as very bad.");
            int note = sc.nextInt();
            if (note &lt;= 4 || note &gt;= 1) {
                System.out.println("Thanks for your review.");
            } else {
                System.out.println("That's better, we'll do our best the next time");

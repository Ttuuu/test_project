<p>If you don't want to repeat yourself (DRY) then consider using multiple methods, and set properties ($this-&gt;collection) and/or pass parameters, as necessary. If you are finding yourself nesting if statements inside a method, it is a good indication that you should be using multiple methods.</p>

<p>For example, for your method, it looks like you could cut the database check into their own method.</p>

<p>If you have a return, then there is no need for an else statement :-) </p>

<pre><code>if($a){
  return;
}
// no need for else
</code></pre>

<p>There is no point in setting a variable $json and echo it, just echo it as you did most of the time, but not all.</p>

<p>It looks as though you could break the rest response into it's own method for example with the if count &gt; 0 return true or false to determine the action.</p>

<pre><code>private function method($results){
    if (count(($results)) &gt; 0) {
        echo Zend_Json::encode($result);
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
</code></pre>

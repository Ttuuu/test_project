<p>The code looks fine.  Instead of <code>const std::string &amp;command</code>, you can take <code>std::string_view</code> command to avoid unnecessary allocation when the argument is not readily a <code>std::string</code> (e.g., string literals).  <code>std::ostringstream</code> seems more appropriate than <code>std::stringstream</code> here, since you are not reading from it.  Creating a new stream may also be more readable than reusing the stream.</p>

<p>Prior to C++20, <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_ostringstream/str" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str</code></a> on string streams always make a copy of the buffer, so there isn't much you can do about it.  Since C++20, you can move the underlying buffer by moving the string stream itself:</p>

<pre><code>// since C++20
std::string response = std::move(ss).str();
</code></pre>

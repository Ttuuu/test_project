<p>In the <code>BiDirectionalReader</code> constructor, the while loop condition can be shortened to <code>while (++top &lt;= --bot)</code> (or replaced with a for loop).  If the bitmap height is odd, the middle row will have duplicate entries in <code>CachedItems</code>.</p>

<p>It is unclear to me why you're excluding the last column when constructing the <code>BiDirectionalIndex</code> and <code>CachedItems</code> data.</p>

<p>The three duplicated statements in the inner for loop can be reduced to one line each:</p>

<pre><code>topLine[x] = (Bits[top * Stride + (x &gt;&gt; 3)] &amp; mask) != 0;
botLine[x] = (Bits[bot * Stride + (x &gt;&gt; 3)] &amp; mask) != 0;
</code></pre>

<p>The declaration <code>(Memory&lt;bool&gt; TopLine, Memory&lt;bool&gt; BottomLine)</code> in <code>CompressSearch</code> would be more readable if written as two separate declarations, which also allows easy use of <code>var</code>:</p>

<pre><code>var TopLine = TargetReader.CachedItems[TopIndex];
var BottomLine = TargetReader.CachedItems[BottomIndex];
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>if (FoundTop &gt; -1 &amp;&amp; FoundBottom &gt; -1)</code> check could be split up and moved into the two earlier ifs.  This would allow for only checking one value (since you just assigned one value, you only need to check the other), and would then only do this check when it needs to be done, rather than every loop iteration.</p>

<p>There is a bit of inconsistency in the naming style, as sometimes your identifiers start with a capital letter, other times lowercase.  I had initially though this was a distinction between member variables and parameters or local variables, but I see this is not the case.</p>

<p>Below is my attempt to arriving at a more <em>readable</em> and more <em>elegant</em> bubble sorting in Haskell:</p>

<pre><code>main = undefined 

doit []  = []
doit [x] = [x]
doit (x:xs) | x &gt; head xs = head xs:doit (x:tail xs)
            | otherwise = x:doit xs 

bubbleSort xs = foldl (\acc e -&gt; doit acc) xs xs
</code></pre>

<p>You requested a shorter version, so the above is short. You requested the use of fold, so the above uses fold. I personally approach Haskell as like doing an mathematical algebra. No redundant formulas, and strive for the most minimal, most readable. </p>

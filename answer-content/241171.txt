<p>Without digging into it too deeply, this seems well put-together and it's clear that you know what you're doing. The only minor thing I picked up on first read is that this:</p>

<pre><code>int *found
</code></pre>

<p>should be using <code>&lt;stdbool.h&gt;</code> instead of an <code>int</code>; mostly to help your users understand what's happening. The same goes for the return value of <code>equals_str</code>.</p>
    </div>

<p>Remember that strings are null terminated char arrays. 
Like this: </p>

<pre><code>char my_string[] = {'a','b','c','\0'}; 
</code></pre>

<p>I would have called NUM, MAX_STRING (or something like it). aux, should then be </p>

<pre><code>char aux[MAX_STRING +1] //+1 for null terimination
</code></pre>

<p>The name aux, is also not good. Use descriptive names on variables, like string_inverted. </p>

<p>Also your function is invert a string and print it, not invert a string. 
Its better to let a function  only do one thing, this let you use your functions as primitives for building other functions. The prototype  could be like this.</p>

<pre><code>void invert(const char *string,char * inverted_string);
</code></pre>

<p>Also if you use a function only inside one compilation unit (c file), make them static.</p>

<p>As other have pointed out, you comment a lot. An ideal code (that don't exist) should not need comments. Use comments to aide code reading when code deviate from this ideal. If you use comments for documenting code, which can be a good idea, specially if you work with others, look in to

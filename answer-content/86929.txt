<p>I wrote this as a comment, but I'd just like to expand on it a bit:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since you only seem to need the number of coins used, and not the values of the coins used, I suppose you can just overpay? Because then you can just use the largest coin and nothing else. In which case the answer will always be <code>number.fdiv(coins.max).ceil</code>, as far as I can tell.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or, in your context:</p>

<pre><code>File.open(ARGV[0]).each_line do |line|
  puts line.to_i.fdiv(5).ceil
end
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, you're often paying too much, but the only thing that's being checked seems to be the number of coins. So who cares?</p>

<p>If the price is $11 (just using the dollar sign for clarity), then yes, the <em>smart</em> way to pay that would with $5 + $5 + $1 (or maybe $5 + $3 + $3). But that's 3 coins, and so is $5 + $5 + $5.</p>

<p>What if the price is just $1? Well, you could pay $1, and use 1 coin. Or you could overpay with a $5 coin... and it'd still be 1 coin.</p>

<p>So... is this a trick question?</p>

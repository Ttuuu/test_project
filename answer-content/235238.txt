<p>A few things I would change are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some private methods tend to check for null on their arguments, even if you control, what they are being called with. Unless I plan to call with NULL, I'd remove those checks.</li>
<li>The exception methods might either provide no message, as they do not help the caller more than the standard message of the exception or provide helpful details, like the value that caused the exception. </li>
<li>The <code>registrations List</code> is used like a <code>Set</code>. As a Set behaves the way you use your List, I'd recommend using a Set. You should also be aware that <code>Set::add</code> already tells you if a new element was added or already contained. </li>
<li><code>forceDelInternal</code> can be static</li>
</ul>

<p>I'd be happy to check more of the code after you have provided the rest of it, as it is harder than necessary with all the red underlines. </p>

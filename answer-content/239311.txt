<p>Not many valid reasons, why would ever <code>isRecordExists2</code> be better method. It is almost always good to extract reusable strings into constants and split code into smaller pieces. I definitely vote for <code>isRecordExists</code>. If you decide to stick with <code>isRecordExists2</code>, why even create <code>sqlQuery</code> variable? You might as well just pass the string itself into <code>queryForObject</code>.</p>

<p>Only possible downsides of using <code>isRecordExists</code> I can think of (but very small and insignificant imho):</p>

<ul>
<li>Static field is always there and taking some piece of memory. Local string would not unless while that method is being called.</li>
<li>That string is not as close to method and therefore code might be harder for read (but we have IDEs to help with that). I would choose better name than <code>QUERY</code> to help with that too.</li>
</ul>

<p>If there are specific coding standards in Spring boot against it, please link them :-)</p>

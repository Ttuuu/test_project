<p>Why is there <code>#pragma once</code> in the implementation file?  Including it twice in the same translation unit is clearly an error that should be fixed, not a normal state of affairs as a header would be.</p>

<p>If the <code>abs()</code> is meant to be <code>std::abs()</code>, we need <code>#include &lt;cmath&gt;</code> and <code>using std::abs;</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>getMin()</code> and <code>getMax</code> functions seem to be exactly like <code>std::min(p, q, ComparePts{})</code> and <code>std::max(p, q, ComparePts{})</code> respectively, so provide very little value as functions.</p>

<p>I didn't get beyond this, as the rest seems to depend too much on the library that defines <code>Float</code>, <code>Point</code> and <code>Segment</code>, and there's no clue which of the many geometry libraries is used.</p>

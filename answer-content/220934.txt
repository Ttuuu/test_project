<p>For the most part your code is okay, however, reading what it is that you want it to do here's what I came up with...</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3

import re
import typing


def most_frequent_letter(text: str) -&gt; typing.Tuple[int, list]:
    text = re.sub('[^a-z]', '', text.replace(' ', '').lower())

    letter_counts = {}
    for letter in text:
        letter_counts[letter] = letter_counts.get(letter, 0) + 1

    counted_letters = {}
    for letter, counter in letter_counts.items():
        counted_letters[counter] = counted_letters.get(counter, []) + [letter]

    max_key = max(counted_letters.keys())
    return max_key, sorted(counted_letters[max_key])


if __name__ == '__main__':
    counted, letters = most_frequent_letter('spam ham jello spam')
    print("{counted} -&gt; {letter}".format(
        counted = counted,
        letter = letters[0]))
</code></pre>

<p>... while I don't know that it's an improvement overall it does return results that may be of use...</p>

<pre><code>3 -&gt; a
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note if ya want the whole list use the following instead under that last <code>if</code> statement...</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code># ...
    print("{counted} -&gt; {letters}".format(
        counted = counted,
        letters = letters))
# ... Should output...
#     3 -&gt; ['a', 'm']

</code></pre>

<p>... while also not counting spaces as letters; which is the only thing that seemed missing from your implementation.</p>

<p>I didn't see any need to use <code>if</code> statements (within the function) so didn't include'em, because dictionaries have a handy <code>get</code> method that allows for defaulting nonexistent <code>key</code> <code>value</code> pares. And I didn't see any use in using <code>collections</code> though it was tempting to use <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/220930/197446">@200_success</a>'s suggestion.</p>

<p>One thing about your code that I do still question though is why are ya wrapping the <code>return</code>ed value within parentheses?</p>

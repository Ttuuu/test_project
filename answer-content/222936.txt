<p>Testing for state repetition by <code>if state in seen:</code> is suboptimal. The number of states could grow exponentially with number of bits (and you are dealing with 200000 bits universe). Since <code>seen</code> is a list, the search time is linear, making the total time complexity quadratic with the size of the period.</p>

<p>Using a set instead of list would immediately improve the performance. However, I recommend to avoid huge collections whatsoever and investigate a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_detection#Floyd's_Tortoise_and_Hare" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Tortoise and Hare</a> approach.</p>

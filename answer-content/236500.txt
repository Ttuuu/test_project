<p>It's hypnotic to watch them balacing!</p>

<p>You assume the delta time is always 0,05sec. For a better simulation you should retrive real delta time.
In terms of code quality, in method update_pendulums_positions, your code will be heavily more readable if you use explicit variable names instead of "num_" something. Yeah, it's physics computation, but still, all computation has a meaning. Your code won't run slower if variable names are longer! (yes, already heard a coworker saying that for C++)</p>

<p>You should also refactor some pieces, like:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>draw_pendulums: the create_line and create_oval are the same, just take pendulum as a parameter of a function</p></li>
<li><p>computation of "denom" (denominator?): only the length change between the two of them</p></li>
<li><p>updating velocities and positions: the two lines for each pendulum are the same</p></li>
<li><p>cardinal coordinates, just add an (x,y) offset as a parameter to handle computation of the second pendulum depending on the coordinates of the first one</p></li>
<li><p>num_3 and num_7: if I'm right, those two can be written as</p></li>
</ul>

<pre><code>num_3 = -2 * m.sin(self.pendulum_1.theta - self.pendulum_2.theta)
num_3 *= self.pendulum_2.mass * self.pendulum_2.theta_dot**2 * self.pendulum_2.length
num_3 *= 1 + m.cos(self.pendulum_1.theta - self.pendulum_2.theta)

num_7 = self.pendulum_2.mass * self.pendulum_2.theta_dot**2 * self.pendulum_2.length
num_7 *= m.cos(self.pendulum_1.theta - self.pendulum_2.theta)
</code></pre>

<p>You can see that some computations are done twice. Use intermediate variable to do those once. Your app is not heavy, but that would help to make something more scalable by optimizing your code.</p>

<p>TL,DR: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" rel="nofollow noreferrer">DRY</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/209015/what-is-self-documenting-code-and-can-it-replace-well-documented-code">Self-documented code</a> (even though writing comments is a rule, it can't hurt to have a 'human-readable' code)</p>

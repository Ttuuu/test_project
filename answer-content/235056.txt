<h2>Minor typos / grammar</h2>

<p><em>Note: most IDEs have a spellchecker and will highlight wrongly spelled words</em></p>

<p>You have an extra space between <code>static</code> and <code>int</code> on line 16. - Most code bases have checkstyle or similair processes to prevent this sort of error, so I wouldn't worry about these sort of things. I just wanted to include it for completeness.</p>

<p>I suggest changing the class comment to "solves a Sudoku board" instead of "solves a Sudoky". A bit knit picky but same goes for the class comment "solves the given sudoku" vs "solves the given Sudoku board"</p>

<p>"reperesnted" should be "represented"</p>

<p>"colum" should be "column"</p>

<p>"emtpy" should be "empty" ...</p>

<h2>Javadoc</h2>

<p>You can use formatting in your javadocs. Assuming you are using an IDE such as eclipse you can highlight the method to see what the javadoc looks like:</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * Solves the given Sudoku, preconditions: 
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;Empty space is reperesnted by 0s&lt;/li&gt; 
 * &lt;li&gt;The sudoku is not already invalid (No duplicates in a row, colum, or 3x3 box,except zeros)&lt;/li&gt; 
 * &lt;li&gt;The sudoku is a normal 9x9 sudoku&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 * @return a solved sudoku if the sudoku is solvable, null if not
 */
public static int[][] solveSudoku(int[][] original) {
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise you can generate Javadoc documentation and see what it looks like.</p>

<h2>Single responsibility principle</h2>

<p>Try to think of methods by themselves. For example, the javadoc for 'solvesudoku' mentions it's a helper method for another method. Try to avoid this mindset. Reading the javadoc I'd like to know what the method does, without going through the javadoc for other methods.</p>

<h2>Method / variable naming</h2>

<p>"solveSudoku" does not make sense. "isSudokuSolved" or "isSudokuBoardSolved" makes more sense.</p>

<h2>Avoid magic numbers / magic strings</h2>

<p>For example numbers "9" and "3" could be declared as static variables at the top. I'd also suggest doing the same for your empty space variable (0) so it's easier to find / change.</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>I was disappointed to see your test references a Python file you found online. Tbh I didn't bother trying to test your code, there's just too much logic in the test classes for me to want to bother with.</p>

<p>Just some minor suggestions...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I think it is the general advice (from what I've read) that you should use English variables.  This seems horribly biased from a coder who only speaks English, but I have seen many English As A Second Language developers post this same advice.  I took just enough French in high school to follow your variable names.</p></li>
<li><p>All of the lines inside your class should be tabbed in.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are expecting all of the numeric values to be integers, you could implement the more strict function <code>ctype_digit()</code> to validate.</p></li>
<li><p>The use of <code>password_hash()</code> is encouraged.  <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.crypt.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.crypt.php</a></p></li>

<p>A couple of small things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you're specifically looking for executable files, you might use <code>which</code> instead of <code>whereis</code> command. From <a href="https://superuser.com/a/40304/553283">this</a> answer, you can see the difference between the two using <code>whatis</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>$  whatis which
which                (1)  - shows the full path of (shell) commands

$  whatis whereis
whereis              (1)  - locate the binary, source, and manual page files for a command
</code></pre>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Be consistent. You've used two different formatting styles:</p>

<pre><code>"where {}".format(app)
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>"Application ,",app,", not forund.",err  # you also have a spelling mistake here (forund -&gt; found) 
</code></pre>

<p>I'd recommend you use the former one</p></li>
<li><p>You should have at least two spaces before an inline comment</p></li>
<li>You should put a space after the comma in <em>almost</em> every situation. (e.g: <code>print("Application,",app,", not found.",err)</code> -&gt; <code>print("Application,", app, ", not found.", err)</code>)</li>
</ol>

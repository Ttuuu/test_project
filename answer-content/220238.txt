<p>The correct solution to your problem is not what those above have suggested.  Loaded strings may or may not be interned, they may even be duplicated in the intern pool.  Creating your own string collection won't help this problem.</p>

<p>The solution you should use is to create a new AppDomain, run your code in that and then dispose of the domain <strike>(and therefore the intern pool)</strike> when you are done with it.</p>

<p><strong>I was wrong about the intern pool being disposed on an app domain unload.  It <em>appears</em> that there is indeed one string intern pool for the whole process</strong></p>

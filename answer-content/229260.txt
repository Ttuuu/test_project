<p>You don't even need to use the second list. You can do a dict comprehension:</p>

<pre><code>{k: k.split('.', 1)[0] for k in list_b}
</code></pre>

<p>This assumes that the data are all structured as you've shown, with a prefix, a dot and a number.</p>

<p>p.s. don't call your variable <code>dict_</code>. Name it according to its application function - <code>animals</code>, or whatever.</p>

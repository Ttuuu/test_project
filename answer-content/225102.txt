<p>You should also take into consideration the JS methods when calculating time and space complexity. It's not as simple as <span class="math-container">\$O(n^2)\$</span> time because you used two nested <code>for</code> loops. Slice, Split, reverse, join are all also <span class="math-container">\$O(n)\$</span> operations under the hood. Split also creates a brand new array so that is also <span class="math-container">\$O(n)\$</span> space.</p>

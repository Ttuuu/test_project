<p>Time complexity-wise, I think not. You're required to 'visit' all numbers, and your solution is <code>O(n)</code>, so that can't be improved.</p>

<p>Code clarity could be improved, as it's not very obvious what the intention is. Some <strong>comments</strong> would help that.
I think shifting indices by 1 might make it clearer (<code>left[i+1] = arr[i] * left[i]</code>), but then maybe not because it'd mess up the last loop.</p>

<p>Have you explored different algorithms? I wonder if straightforward memoization makes a very clear solution for this.</p>

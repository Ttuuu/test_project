<h3>Review</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>see if I use the global variables, nested loops and two functions with parameters correctly</em></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><code>loopCount</code> is a magic variable, its meaning beats me. Is it some kind of debugging assistant?</li>
<li>The indentations seem random picks between 4 and 8 spaces. Stick to 4.</li>
<li>The <code>div</code> method is public, the <code>mul</code> private. Why introduce this inconsistency? </li>
<li>Give full names to your methods for readabiliy <code>divide</code>, <code>multiply</code>.</li>
<li>The methods are void, printing the results to the console. This limits usability to zero. Separate interaction with the console from the method flow. Use <em>return</em> values to yield results. Let <code>main</code> log these results to the console.</li>
<li>As suggested in the comments, you can optimize division by probing the smallest prime divisor to minimize cycles in the loops.</li>
<li>Be a bit more consistent in aligning brackets with method declarations.</li>
<li>For readability and consistency, add a blank line after the imports and remove that blank line after the last method.</li>
</ul>

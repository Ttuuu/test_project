<p>Variable naming needs some work. <code>SIZE</code>, <code>m</code>, <code>ch</code>, <code>counter1</code> etc. could use more thought out names indicating what they do or what they are related to.<br>
Does <code>win</code> win the game? Apparently it checks <em>for</em> a win so a rename makes sense here.</p>

<hr>

<p><code>int score[2] = {};</code> while allowed is redundant</p>

<hr>

<p>Separate functions a bit. As it stands now it's somewhat hard to read so consider adding newlines between functions.  </p>

<p>Look into <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/random" rel="nofollow noreferrer">random</a> if you need randomization in your programs.</p>

<hr>

<p>Mostly personal preference but adding braces where possible can save you from nasty bugs in the long run.</p>

<p>You have a variable for the board size yet the game breaks in various ways for sizes &gt;3.</p>

<p>You can use the <code>Encoding</code> class to convert between strings and byte arrays, for example <code>Encoding.UTF8.GetString</code> and <code>Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes</code>. That gives data without the extra padding between each character code, so it's less predictable.</p>

<p>64 bytes of crypto strength data seems overkill for a salt. The salt isn't kept secret so it doesn't have to be that unpredictable. It's only there to create a padding that is practically unique for each user, to prevent use of dictionary attacks and rainbow tables, so it doesn't have to be so very massive.</p>

<p>According to the answers to the question <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/11221/how-big-salt-should-be">How big salt should be?</a>, 8 bytes is enough for any reasonably large system accoring to the standard, and 16 bytes give plenty of margin for any system imaginable.</p>

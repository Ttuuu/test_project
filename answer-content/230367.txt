<p>I don't mean to drag this up but have you considered a recursion function?  Not so long ago I created a binary CART model in VBA that uses a basic recursive structure along the lines of:-</p>

<p>Function A 
- Call function B to add row to output recordset object
- Check for leaf conditions; exit function early if yes
- Call function C to calculate best split and GINI with current recordset
- Filter current recordset by L branch condition of optimal split
- Recursively call Function A, passing filtered recordset
- 
- Filter current recordset by R branch condition
- Recursively call Function A, passing filtered recordset</p>

<p>It's not a huge amount of code at all and the hardest part was getting used to the way VBA treats ADODB.recordset objects and filtering.</p>

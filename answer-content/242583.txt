<p><strong>Code fails to detect invalid code points</strong></p>

<p>There are 1,112,064 valid unicode code points, not 2<sup>32</sup>.</p>

<p>The valid range is  [0x0 - 0x10FFFF] except the sub-range of [0xD800 - 0xDFFF].  This later sub-range is for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16#U+D800_to_U+DFFF" rel="noreferrer">surrogates</a>.</p>

<p>UTF-8 is not defined for 4-byte values outside this range.  Code should not attempt to create a six-byte "UTF-8" unless it is calling it an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8#History" rel="noreferrer">obsolete 1993</a> version of UTF-8.</p>

<p>Better code would detect invalid sequences.</p>

<p><strong>Code silently discard extra bytes</strong></p>

<p>Should code read an extra final 1, 2 or 3 bytes, no error indication is provided.</p>

<p>The hard problems for one-time pads are </p>

<ol>
<li>randomly generating the pad, and</li>
<li>securely sharing the pad between the participants (and nobody else).</li>
</ol>

<p>The first problem is not solved, because the <code>random</code> package is a <em>pseudo-random</em> generator - it can't produce enough randomness for this purpose.  We'd need a <em>true</em> random number generator, which (in general) requires a hardware source of randomness.  Deterministic arithmetic is not a good source of crypto-grade randomness.</p>

<p>The second problem doesn't appear to be solved - to my understanding, we store the OTP, but don't distribute it, so the only way to decode a message is by returning it to the place where it was encoded.  This might work for transmission across time (i.e. storage), but it's unsuitable for transmission over distance (i.e. communication).</p>

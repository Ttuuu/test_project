<h2>Good Job (for the Expression)!</h2>
<p>Your expression is pretty good for what I guess you are trying to do. My guess is that you just want to see <strong>if there is one email in a string</strong>. Clearly, I don't see that we are going to extract any email (since your expression currently doesn't do that not to mention the strings are quite unstructured).</p>
<p>To answer your question, I'm pretty sure it would miss lots of input strings, but to begin with, we can just add an <code>i</code> (insensitive) flag to the expression and remove <code>A-Z</code>s:</p>
<pre><code>(?i)[a-z0-9_.+-]+\s*at\s*[a-z0-9.-]+\s*[a-z0-9-]*\s*dot*\s*[a-z0-9-]{2,6}\s*(?:dot*\s*[a-z0-9-]{2,6})?
</code></pre>
<h3>Example of What is Going to Miss:</h3>
<p>For instance "dot co dot uk" types of emails are going to be missed. For that, we would add an optional non-capturing group: <code>(?:dot*\s*[a-z0-9-]{2,6})?</code></p>
<h2>Not sure if a stand-alone regex would be the best solution!</h2>
<p>The problem you are having is very complicated. I'm sure there are alternative methods to solve your problem, but I'm not really good at offering solutions.</p>

for text in emails:
    clean_text = re.sub(regex_pattern, '', text)
    print(clean_text)

<p>The way you are checking if any allowedPositions are in the staticCubes list seems very inefficient to me.  I think it would be more efficient to check whether each position is in the staticCubes list as they are created then add them to the allowedPositions list.</p>

<p>Using a LINQ query for this wil also make it much more concise:</p>

<pre><code>allowedPositions = (from int x in Enumerable.Range(0, matrixVolume)
                    from int y in Enumerable.Range(0, matrixVolume)
                    from int z in Enumerable.Range(0, matrixVolume)
                    let position = new Vector3(x, y, z)
                    where !staticCubes.Contains(position)
                    select position).ToList();
</code></pre>
    </div>

<li><p>Don't use QT objects when you are not working with QT constructs. There is no benefit to it.</p></li>
<li><p>Your node::_id is unsigned shirt, which for MSVS has a range of 0 to 65,535. Be aware of that when you graph grows.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not use a map. A <code>std::vector</code> is way faster/bettter for traversing than a <code>std::map</code>. </p></li>
<li><p>You do a lot of copying data around:</p>

<pre><code>QMap&lt;Node*, unsigned short&gt; nextNodes = minNode-&gt;nextNodes();
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>That is a copy of all neighbors everytime you access a node during your search. If you really need the temporary, which you dont then at least make this a reference.</p>

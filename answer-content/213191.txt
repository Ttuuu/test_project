<p>Your code is overall very neat and clean and easily readable, I think you're ready for the next level!</p>

<hr>

<p>This switch maps from one string to another:</p>

<pre><code>switch (selection) {
    case "blue":
        this.selected = "appBlue";
        break;
    case "green":
        this.selected = "appGreen";
        break;
    case "red":
        this.selected = "appRed";
        break;
    default:
        this.selected = "appBlue";
}
</code></pre>

<p>This could either be changed into using a lookup dictionary:</p>

<pre><code>let mappedComponents = { red: "appRed", blue: "appBlue", green: "appGreen" };
this.selected = mappedComponents[selection];
</code></pre>

<p>Or you could just skip that remapping and change the names of the components so that they directly match the <code>selection</code> value:</p>

<pre><code>components: {
    blue: Blue,
    green: Green,
    red: Red
},

this.selected = selection;
</code></pre>

<p>Other notes that might not have been in your control for the assignment:</p>

<ul>
<li>The CSS is duplicated. You could extract <code>padding</code>, <code>margin</code> and <code>text-align</code> to a separate CSS class.</li>
<li>I would recommend having just one component for all three different colors and use a property to inject its colors.</li>
</ul>

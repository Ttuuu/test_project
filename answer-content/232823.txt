<p>The code looks okay. The only thing to be aware of is that when event listeners are added to DOM elements, there could be memory leaks if those elements would happen to get removed from the DOM (including re-creation). An alternative approach would be to add an event listener to a parent/root element and delegate function calls based on the type of element that was clicked.</p>

<p>The indentation in <code>adminMode.init()</code> is somewhat inconsistent towards the end.</p>

<p>Semi-colons are added to terminate most all lines, except for the lines that declare objects (e.g. <code>octopus</code>, <code>viewList</code>, etc. but not the first one i.e. <code>model</code>). </p>

<p>These lines in <code>viewDetailsList.init()</code> could be simplified:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>    this.catImg.addEventListener(“click”, function(){
        octopus.catClicks();
    })
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>to just this: </p>

<pre><code>this.catImg.addEventListener(“click”, octopus.catClicks)
</code></pre>
    </div>

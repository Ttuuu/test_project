<h2>Critique</h2>

<p>You have to describe something for which your input scale, which in this would be the length of your string, so in this regard your implementation is still linear. The part where you try every single possible index for storing a specific character is overkill, since it is often possible to directly calculate it through some kind of hashing. It would therefore be much faster to use a dictionary or the equivalent.</p>

<h2>Alternative</h2>

<p>We can solve this problem very simply for a more general case (any sequence of items is unique) by turning it into a set:</p>

<pre><code>is_unique = lambda xs: len(xs) == len(set(xs))
</code></pre>

<p>Note that you might want to do some extra work if you want to only have printable characters, such as by applying a filter first.</p>

<p>Since you weren't very clear on which aspects of your code you want to have reviewed, here are several:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow">PEP 8</a>: Standard guidelines. I can see several deviation from standard. It is always a good practice to follow standard guidelines, even in very short and simple programs.</p></li>
<li><p>Documentation. No documentation provided at either class level, module level, function level or inline.</p></li>
<li><p>Design. Right now, functions <code>option_select</code> and <code>main_menu</code> and class <code>selections</code> all assume that there are four options overall. What happens if you change the number of options in one of them, but forgot to update the rest? Think of the way so that you do not have to be manually editing everything once a single change occurs.</p></li>
<li><p>Shebangs. If you don't have good reason to put it, don't put it. More info: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)" rel="nofollow">Shebangs</a></p></li>
<li><p>Unused imports. Why have you imported <code>os</code>?</p></li>
<li><p>You said you wanted to avoid last <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> statement. There are two ways I can think of:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Have another method error in your class Selection which prints your error message, then:</p>

<pre><code>func = option_menu.get(test, menu_selection.error)
func()
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Instead of printing statements in class functions, return the statements, then:</p>

<pre><code>print option_menu.get(test, "ERROR MESSAGE")
</code></pre></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

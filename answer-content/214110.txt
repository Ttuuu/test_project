<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>I would cleanup the logic slightly by using a for-loop or a do-while:</p>

<pre><code>void getline(std::fstream&amp; in, std::string&amp; word, char delim ='\n')
{
    char ch;

    do
    {
        in.get(ch);
        word += ch;
    }
    while(ch != delim);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I think this version reads more nicely by avoiding the break-statement. By the way, I also wouldn't assign word to be empty inside the function: this could be up to the user. Either you pass in an empty string if you want to start fresh, but maybe you <em>do</em> want to append, which you can't do with your current version.</p>

<p>As also mentioned, there is no reason to have the functionality in a class. Just make it a free function.</p>

<p>This problem is famously called the "Josephus Problem", read up on google.</p>

<p>Does the interview question specifically ask you to write code representing the given situation?
Because there is a simpler way to get the person who will remain, by doing some paperwork before writing a simple mathematical equation.</p>

<p>By tabulating <code>n</code> and <code>k</code> upto a small number like 6 or 8, it's easy to observe that when <code>n</code> is a power of 2, the person with <code>k = 1</code> wins. Between powers of two, <code>k</code> equals successive odd numbers. 
That is, when <code>n</code> is one more than a power of 2, 3 wins. When <code>n</code> is two more than a power of two, 5 wins.</p>

<p>It can be inferred that when <code>n</code> is of the form <em>2<sup>M</sup> + q</em> , the <em>(q+1)<sup>th</sup></em> odd number wins.
Since every odd number is of the form <em>2X - 1</em>, the desired winner is 
<code>k</code> = <em>2(q+1) - 1 =&gt;</em>
<code>k</code> = <em>2q + 1</em> ....... <strong>(1)</strong></p>

<p>Since <code>n</code> is of the form <em>2<sup>M</sup> + q,</em>
    we can solve for <code>q</code> in terms of <code>n</code> as,
    <em>q = n - 2<sup>floor(log<sub>2</sub> n ) </sup></em></p>

<p>So the code will simply be the mathematical statement (1) above, written in language of choice.</p>

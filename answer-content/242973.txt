<p>The code is horrible.</p>

<p>It probably contains all of the top 10 vulnerabilities listed on the OWASP web site.</p>

<p>It uses a programming language that is well-known for its bad security history and its awful API that makes it difficult to write secure, solid code.</p>

<p>Forget about that tutorial, warn others about it, find a better tutorial with focus on good code and security, and start over again. A good starting point is the OWASP site. If you really want to stay with PHP, at least use the latest version.</p>

<p>You also have an off-by-one error: the condition <code>&lt; 1</code> doesn't match the error message <code>at least 2</code>. This means you didn't even test your code properly. Especially testing the edge cases is important.</p>

<p>Here are some things that may help you improve your software.  It seems nicely structured and commented.</p>

<h2>Use the required <code>#include</code>s</h2>

<p>The code uses <code>uint32_t</code> which means that it should <code>#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;</code>.  It was not difficult to infer, but it helps reviewers if the code is complete.  Also, <code>size_t</code> also needs an include.  See <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/types/size_t" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/types/size_t</a></p>

<h2>Fix the bug</h2>

<p>The test code currently contains this function:</p>

<pre><code>int init_suite3(void) {
    if ((tour7 = newTournament(SIZE2, NPLAYERS7))) {
        return -1;
    } else {
        return 0;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>That's an error.  The <code>if</code> should be this instead:</p>

<pre><code>if ((tour7 = newTournament(SIZE2, NPLAYERS7)) == NULL) {
</code></pre>

<h2>Proofread the comments</h2>

<p>Although there are a lot of comments, and the idea of documenting with Doxygen is a good one, I find that the comments don't really help me understand the program.  For example, the documentation for <code>getWinner()</code> has this utterly confusing note:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please note the next winner can be different from a runner up. next winner means that this element will loose to the winner only and win against all the other tournament players. since this element might have loose to the winner in the initial rounds their is a good possibility for be it the runner up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First, I think you meant "lose" instead of "loose" but even with that change, I still can't parse this sentence and have no idea what it was intending to convey.  </p>

<p>What the reader of this documentation really needs to know is <em>what the function does</em> which, curiously, is not part of the documentation at the moment.    </p>

<h2>Use better naming</h2>

<p>We have <code>newTournament</code> which seems like a good enough name, but <code>setupTour</code> is not.  First, "Tour" is an unfortunate abbreviation for "Tournament" that is easily misconstrued.  Second, and most important, "set up" implies a configuration, after which some action is taken, but what it really does is actually run the whole tournament to its conclusion.  A more intuitive name might have been <code>runTournament</code> instead.  Also, it might be better to prefix all of the API functions with the same prefix, as perhaps <code>Tournament_new</code>, <code>Tournament_run</code>, <code>Tournament_free</code>, etc.</p>

<h2>Consider expanding testing</h2>

<p>The <code>printTour</code> routine is never actually tested.  It might be a good idea to make sure that all of the functions are tested.  What you have is a really nice start.</p>

<h2>Provide a full working example</h2>

<p>This comment is really more about how to get a good code review rather than about the code itself.  While the CUnit test is good, an example showing a small but complete example would be useful not only as documentation for users but also for reviewers.</p>

<p><code>getSize</code> seems a bit redundant (since you provide a way to get to the underlying vector, and that can be used to get the size).  Since <code>Vector3D</code> doesn't have one size, what would that number mean?</p>

<p>Add a way to get all 3 dimensions.</p>

<p>The <code>getData</code> methods are dangerous, since they give access to the underlying vector that would allow the user to change the size of it.</p>

<p>If you are concerned about the dangers of having a resize function, you could have <code>resize</code> throw an exception if the <code>Vector3D</code> already has a size (<code>data</code> is not empty). Then possibly rename it to <code>setsize</code> or <code>init</code>.</p>

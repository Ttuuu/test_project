<p>This is some nice polished code. I have just a few remarks.</p>

<p>When initializing ELEMENTS, the piece names get pasted in twice.
Perhaps you'd like to loop over them,
adding a black and a white variant to the dict?
You might even associate the proper unicode code point
with each enum member, rather than calling <code>auto()</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>        [(Color.BLACK, Piece.PAWN) for _ in range(8)],
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>You have nice helpers everywhere.
Except for the two lines about pawns.
Maybe you'd like a <code>get_pawns(color)</code> function?</p>

<p>Instead of enumerating <code>row</code> and then doing this:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>        piece = ELEMENTS.get(piece)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>consider running enumerate over <code>map(ELEMENTS.get, row)</code>.</p>

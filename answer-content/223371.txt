<p>In your code, you are checking for changes in a vector or for the differences between consecutive elements of a vector by using <code>lag</code> and then cleaning up the introduced <code>NA</code> value. When looking for changes, I would find it cleaner to handle the first element separately, which enables you to do the operation in a single line of code. For differences in timestamp, <code>diff</code> would make everything a lot cleaner:</p>

<pre><code>metrics &lt;- metrics %&gt;%
  mutate(typing_episode = cumsum(c(1, head(package_name, -1) != tail(package_name, -1)))) %&gt;%
  group_by(typing_episode) %&gt;%
  mutate(second_group = cumsum(c(1, diff(timestamp) &gt; 1000 * 60 * 3)),
         typing_episode2 = typing_episode * 1000 + second_group)
print(metrics)
</code></pre>

<p>As you note, <code>typing_episode2</code> might have repeats if <code>second_group</code> can exceed 1000. A reasonable alternative might be to do something like <code>typing_episode2 = paste0(typing_episode, "_", second_group)</code>. Then you won't need to worry about non-unique <code>typing_episode2</code> values.</p>

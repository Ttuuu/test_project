<p>If you add a <code>increaseCapacity()</code> function your code gets easier to read:</p>

<pre><code>public void add(String s){
    if(size &lt; stringList.length){
        stringList[size++] = s;
        characterCount += s.length();
    }
    else{
        increaseCapacity();
        add(s);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now it's also easier to see that this can be written nicer by inverting the if:</p>

<pre><code>public void add(String s){
    if(size &gt;= stringList.length){
        increaseCapacity();            
    }

    stringList[size++] = s;
    characterCount += s.length();
}
</code></pre>

<p>This also got rid of the recursive call. </p>

<p><strong>Misc</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I doubt that your class performs better than simply using <code>+</code> to concatenate strings, but I'm assuming it's just for academic purposes.</li>
<li>Use unit tests to test, it's a lot easier than reading input from the command line.</li>
<li><code>initial capacity</code> isn't such a helpful comment, as it is just a rephrasing of the variable name; if you think capacity is a better term, just rename the variable.</li>
<li><code>size</code> isn't really the size of anything, but a count, so I would rename it to <code>stringCount</code> (otherwise readers may assume that it is the size of <code>stringList</code>; count also fits in better with <code>characterCount</code>).</li>
<li>your spacing is off (you can use any IDE to fix all formatting issues).</li>
</ul>

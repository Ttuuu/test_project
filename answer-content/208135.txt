<p>No much room for improvement here. The code is clear, readable, maintainable, short and nice. You <em>could</em> get rid of the three iterations by using a loop and filling three lists all in one iteration, but you'd sacrifice maintainability for a few microseconds saved. Don't do this unless you are in a real critical spot. For real world applications, keep it as it is.</p>

<p>One thing however is the PersonUtil. From an OO perspective, the Person should probably know whether it is underaged or senior or whatever and contain that business logic itself, so that you don't have to resort to a util-class. However, if the Person is an entity, eventually generated, you basically have no other choice.</p>

<p>I think the CSS looks fine. To your questions</p>

<p>a.) It doesn't matter which container has the grid property. It's CSS. It's not semantic.</p>

<p>b.) I am not sure if it is considered a best practice, but a lot of people seem to use it this way. Just google CSS nested grid and you will get quite some articles and videos on that topic. For example <a href="https://gridbyexample.com/examples/example21/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> and <a href="https://www.quackit.com/css/grid/tutorial/create_a_nested_grid.cfm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a>.</p>

<p>c.) Counter question: Why not? CSS doesn't add any semantic meaning to HTML. It's just for styling. So, IMHO as long as it works and is scalable/maintainable it's fine.</p>

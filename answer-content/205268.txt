<p>A couple of things:</p>

<p>The word is <code>attempt</code>.  You get it right in some places but not all.  Be consistent.</p>

<p>You've hardcoded this for a local console.  Personally I like to pass the input and output streams to the class.  This gives you the flexibility to use network streams as well as a local console.</p>

<p>Another personal preference,having a separate method for one line of code that is only called once, I thinki, is overkill</p>

<p>I think you have the properties, <code>Win</code>, and <code>Endgame</code> backwards.  To me if the player wins it should be set to true and if the game is entering the endgame portion then it also should be set to true.</p>

<p>Avoid magic numbers, either make them properties that can be set or constants that won't change.</p>

<p>When getting a single character input, it is much simpler to use the <code>Read</code> method and check if the input character is in range.</p>

<p>Instead of setting the <code>Endgame</code> property in the <code>PlayAgain</code> method, it would make more sense to have the <code>PlayAgain</code> method return a boolean.</p>

<p>This one applies to now and in any future endeavors.  If you ever find that you absolutely must use <code>goto</code>, you really need to closely examine your code until you can figure out how to avoid it.  <code>goto</code> is a very bad habit to get into.</p>

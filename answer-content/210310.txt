<p>Generally if you want a more in depth review you should provide more code and a potential specifics you want to improve on; your code is very thin, and so it's a little difficult to help you expand on it, however, I would say that there's a few different things you can do to this to improve or follow a different direction forward.</p>

<p>Your use of pure components is good for <code>BuildingUpdateBoxHeader</code> and <code>BuildingUpdateBoxBody</code> as using primitive props is better for performance. However, using a <code>content</code> object inside your props for <code>BuildingUpdateBox</code> means React cannot shallow compare your props and is unable to determine when not to rerender the component, causing potentially wasted rerenders.</p>

<p>I would recommend trying JSS (css in js) to embed your styles directly in your application for an alternate solution to specifying <code>className</code> manually. This couples your css with its implementation rather than needing to update both the css &amp; js when you modify them.</p>

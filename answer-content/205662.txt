<p>Here, you accept program arguments:</p>

<pre><code>int main(int argv, char** argc) {
</code></pre>

<p>But then you never use <code>argc</code> or <code>argv</code> (note that it's conventional to call the <em>count</em> <code>argc</code>, and the <em>values</em> <code>argv</code>, not the other way around)!</p>

<p>Instead, the input and output files are hard-coded, forcing you to move files around.  Why not allow the user to specify input and output as arguments?  And if not specified, it's probably best to default to standard input and output streams, so that your program can be used in a pipeline, rather than being constrained to work only on files.</p>

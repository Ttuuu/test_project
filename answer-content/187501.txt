<p>You have created a working game, kuddo's for that. </p>

<h1>The good</h1>

<ul>
<li>Some parts of the code are divided into functions</li>
<li><p>(nearly) made this work for both python3 and python2</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>NameError: name 'raw_input' is not defined</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Adding this to the top of the file would circumvent that</p>

<pre><code>try:
    raw_input()
except NameError:
    raw_input = input
</code></pre>

<p>This is tagged with 2.7, but if there is no specific reason for it. I suggest to start writing in 3.x</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>The bad</h1>

<ul>
<li>This code is begin suffocated, <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#blank-lines" rel="noreferrer">#add a few blank lines. [PEP8]</a></li>
<li><p>Stick to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)</p>

<p>You are repeating yourself in some areas</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>display_board(theBoard)
position = player_choice(theBoard)
place_marker(theBoard, player1_marker, position)
if win_check(theBoard, player1_marker):
    display_board(theBoard)
    print('Congratulations! You have won the game!')
    game_on = False
else:
    if full_board_check(theBoard):
        display_board(theBoard)
        print('The game is a draw!')
        break
    else:
        turn = 'Player 2'
</code></pre>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Use <code>'string'.format()</code> over string concants</p>

<p>At your <code>display_board(board)</code> function for example</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This is not a complete answer, but it is too long to put in a comment, so I placed it here.</p>

<p>I read your question, and given that it is unclear what the overall purpose of this code is (what kind of rules?), that's not easy. As far as I can tell there's <strong>no easy way</strong> to reduce the load on the database. Most queries simply have to be done. </p>

<p>That said: The best ways to unload a database are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get all the rows you need in one request.</li>
<li>Don't update what hasn't changed (obviously).</li>
<li>Do all inserts with one query (up to a certain amount of rows).</li>
</ul>

<p>Can this be applied to your code? </p>

<p>I think that <code>Document::storeContent()</code> is an good method to start with, because the last two points, I mentioned above, apply to it. You do an <code>updateOrCreate()</code> for each rule result, generating two queries for each result.</p>

<p>What you could do is make this more efficient by handling all the rules in a few queries, like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Store the new results of the rules in a variable: <code>$newResults = $this-&gt;results();</code></li>
<li>Read all existing results rows from the database with one query: <code>$oldResults = $this-&gt;"read database()";</code></li>
<li>Compare these two results and: A. Eliminate what hasn't changed. B. Update what needs updating. C. Insert, with one query, all new results.</li>
</ol>

<p>It is very hard for me to give you real code examples, given the abstract nature of the code you've given, but I don't think it is beyond your capabilities to implement the above algorithm. I think a new 'rules' class, that encapsulates this behavior, would be appropriate.</p>

<p>This way you assure that, when a new parse is done, only those queries are executed that are really necessary. You should, of course, never parse a document or email unnecessarily. </p>

<p>I hope this helps a bit.</p>

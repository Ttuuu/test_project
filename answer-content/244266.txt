<h2>Shadowing</h2>
<p>You declare these globals:</p>
<pre><code>start_date = '2010-01-01'
end_date = '2030-12-31'
</code></pre>
<p>and also these parameters:</p>
<pre><code>def create_date_table(start_date, end_date):
</code></pre>
<p>That is confusing; the local parameters will take priority. One way to distinguish the two is to capitalize the global constants, which is standard anyway.</p>
<h2>snake_case</h2>
<p><code>timestampStr</code> should be <code>timestamp_str</code>.</p>
<h2>Selenium</h2>
<p>I don't know a lot about the website, but a brief visit makes it seem like this is simple enough for you to avoid Selenium - which tries to emulate a browser - and do direct HTTP using the Requests library plus BeautifulSoup, which will be much more efficient.</p>
<h2>pathlib</h2>
<p>This:</p>
<pre><code>os.stat(local_path_raw+"\{}".format(file))
</code></pre>
<p>will be simplified using <code>pathlib.Path(local_path_raw)</code>.</p>
<h2>Exception swallowing</h2>
<p>This:</p>
<pre><code>    except:
        pass
</code></pre>
<p>is extremely dangerous. It will prevent user break (Ctrl+C) from working, and will hide anything going wrong in that section of the code - even if it's a critical failure. At the absolute least, <code>except Exception</code> instead of <code>except</code>, and ideally print what's gone wrong.</p>
<h2>os.environ.get</h2>
<p>You don't seem to be treating these parameters as optional; you don't provide defaults. So this will create some failures later than they should occur. Use <code>[]</code> instead to move the failure up to a point where it's more obvious that a parameter is missing.</p>
<h2>Autocommit</h2>
<p>Since you've enabled this, why do you also</p>
<pre><code>conn.commit()
</code></pre>
<p>?</p>

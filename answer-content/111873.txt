<p>Since there is no such method yet in ruby, you can always add your own if that makes sense to your use case (if you find yourself needing that method a lot).</p>

<p>Here is and example implementation:</p>

<pre><code>class Array
  def extract! &amp;block
    extracted = select(&amp;block)
    reject!(&amp;block)
    extracted
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>The code above first selects what you want to return and then destructively removes those items which is what you want to avoid doing manually to improve readability.</p>

<p>Note: the method is called <code>extract!</code> with a bang since it modifies the array itself. If the method wuould not modify the underlying object, it would be equivalent to <code>select</code>, so you might name it <code>select!</code>, or <code>select_and_remove!</code> if you prefer.</p>

<p>Usage:</p>

<pre><code>a = (0..10).to_a

# extract even numbers from our array
p a.extract!(&amp;:even?) # =&gt; [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

# odd numbers are left
p a # =&gt; [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
</code></pre>

<p><code>index</code> is a singular noun that doesn't represent of group of things, therefor it isn't a good name for an array.</p>

<p>Your method is named <code>anagram_indices</code> and returns an array, I like to call the returned array <code>results</code>, so it's clear that the array are the anagram indices.</p>

<p>Using <code>i</code> and <code>x</code> is <em>very</em> confusing, so much that it made me question my own knowledge of the <code>enumerate</code> function. I expected <code>i</code> to be the index and <code>x</code> to be the letter, while it's the opposite. You should rename those with better variable names. Actually, using single letter variable names is almost never a good idea, there are some edge cases. I expect a variable named <code>i</code> to represent an index, for example.</p>

<p>Your algorithm itself is fine, but the naming is very confusing, which is kind of a problem.</p>

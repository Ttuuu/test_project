<p>In addition to <em>hjpotter92</em>'s answer you can improve your counting using <code>dict.get()</code></p>

<pre><code>for word in cleaned_words:
    word_counter[word] = word_counter.get(word, 0) + 1
</code></pre>

<p><code>dict.get(key, default)</code>checks for the key in dict and returns default in case key is not in dict.
Makes 1 line out of 4 and improves readability quite a bit. For sure using <code>collections.counter</code> is also a good approach - but it includes importing another package.</p>

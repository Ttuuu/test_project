<p>Good job on your first Python program!</p>

<p>You used a <strong>Dictionary</strong> to store all the alien classes. There are many other alternatives to do the same task. The most common one for this kind of problem is <strong>Python Classes</strong> (<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_classes.asp" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_classes.asp</a>).</p>

<p>You could simply create a <strong>class</strong> called <code>myArmy</code> and then create your soldiers as <strong>objects</strong>. </p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>#Create a class called myArmy
class myArmy:

  #Use the __init__() function to assign values for name, color...
  def __init__(self, name, color, size, speed, damage):

    self.name = name
    self.color = color
    self.size = size
    self.speed = speed
    self.damage = damage

#Create your soldiers (Referred to as "Objects" here. The __init__() function is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object.
rogue = myArmy('rogue', 'green', 'small', 'fast', 'small')
warrior = myArmy('warrior', 'green', 'medium', 'average', 'heavy')
hunter = myArmy('hunter', 'dark green', 'average', 'average', 'average')

#Access Rogue information for example
print(rogue.name, rogue.color, rogue.size, rogue.speed, rogue.damage)
</code></pre>

<p>Next step should be to give them attack/defense values and attack speed, and let the user make them battle each other!</p>

<p>Perhaps a more "friendly" message would be nice and/or a way to customize it. As an example the generic catcher we're using right now reads: </p>

<pre><code>echo '&lt;div style="width: 700px;"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sorry but we ran into an unexpected problem.&lt;/h3&gt;
The problem has been logged and support staff have been notified.
&lt;h6&gt;Please try again.&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;';
</code></pre>
    </div>

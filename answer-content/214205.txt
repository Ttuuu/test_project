<p>If I understood correctly, you have to traverse a list of components where each element has a hierarchy-like structure?</p>

<p>Try the visitor pattern <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/visitor_pattern.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/visitor_pattern.htm</a> it is a very clean solution of what you're trying to do without any static methods.</p>

<p>And for traversing the children of each component, I think you're trying to do a pseudo-BFS, but it's a bit confusing. BFS is very tricky using recursion. The iterative version kf BFS should be something similar to this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16380026/implementing-bfs-in-java">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16380026/implementing-bfs-in-java</a></p>

<p>Depending on you effort you want to put in your redesing, you coud use some kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern" rel="nofollow noreferrer">state pattern</a>, and therefore just kow the valid events, instead of calculating them every time.</p>

<p>Or you just simply turn the logic arround. Instead of getting all valid events, and check if the requested is in the list, just check if the conditions for the requested event are met:</p>

<pre><code>public bool CanPerformEvent(ReferralEventEnum referralEvent)
{            
    var successfulEvents = ReferralHistory
        .Where(h =&gt; h.Successful)
        .Select(h =&gt; h.EventId)
        .ToList();

    switch(referralEvent)
    {
        case ReferralEventEnum.RequestCompleted:
            return successfulEvents.Contains(ReferralEventEnum.RequestCompleted) &amp;&amp; successfulEvents.Contains(ReferralEventEnum.RequestReceived)
        // a lot more cases
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I just noticed, that you have a list of enums, and check for enums in that list. It is way mor efficient to use <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/8480/4136669">Flags Enums (Explanation as always on Stackoverflow)</a></p>

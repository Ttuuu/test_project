<p>In my testing with mysql-connector 2.2.9, bulk insert queries using <code>executemany()</code> were automatically batched as described in the <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/connector-python-api-mysqlcursor-executemany.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">mysql-connector documentation</a> UNLESS they used <code>'INSERT IGNORE'</code>. (I have yet to test <code>'ON DUPLICATE KEY â€¦'</code> statements.)</p>

<p>I found that the difference was up to 100x faster for plain <code>'INSERT'</code> statements vs. <code>'INSERT IGNORE'</code>; batching is clearly not being applied for the latter method.</p>

<p>In order to achieve a similar level of performance, I used a raw insert into a temp table, then an upsert to the target data using data within that temp table. This was quite close in performance to the raw insert statement.</p>

<p>As a side note, the PugSQL library makes it very easy to run properly parameterized queries - no more string formatting - and since it's raw SQL, there's no problem with upserts. It's a lot easier to learn than an ORM library, too.

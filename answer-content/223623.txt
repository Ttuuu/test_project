<p>I'm submitting this as a different answer because it goes in a different direction from my previous one, eliminating the bool cast as well as individual functions. You can simply define a tuple of regular expressions and apply <code>all</code>.</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>rexes = ('[A-Z]', '[a-z]', '[0-9]')
# ...
if len(password) &gt;= 8 and all(re.search(r, password) for r in rexes)):
    print('Strong password')
</code></pre>
    </div>

<p>I think the biggest boost to readability will come from giving things proper names. You currently have a lot of <code>RHS[r][i]</code> going on, with <code>i = 0, 1, 2, 3</code>. For someone who does not know what these things are (including possibly you in a few months), this makes the code basically unreadable.</p>

<p>I would start by making the iteration look like this:</p>

<pre><code>for r, (a, b, c, d) in enumerate(RHS):
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>a, b, c, d</code> are actual sensible names (like <code>name</code>, <code>length</code>, or whatever is actually at those positions).</p>

<p>Next, your setup code can be simplified using the fact that e.g. <code>[0] * 3 == [0, 0, 0]</code> (but don't do it with nested loops, see below):</p>

<pre><code>machine_assigne_time = [[0] * op] for op in mc_op]
max_c = [0] * len(lot_size)  # Equal number of job
completion_time = [0] * len(RHS)
</code></pre>

<p>And finally, without being able to run your code, the most obvious case for the slow down are your repeated calls to <code>list.index</code>. This is very slow (\$\mathcal{O}(n)\$ in the worst case). I would try to find a more efficient data structure for this (dictionaries?).</p>

<p>Are you hoping for the arc length around a sphere or the Earth? What about going through the earth in a straight line? Currently your math solves the sphere but not Earth.</p>
<p>The earth has 2 radi that are used to solve the arc length.</p>
<pre><code>R = √ [ (r1² * cos(B))² + (r2² * sin(B))² ] / [ (r1 * cos(B))² + (r2 * sin(B))² ]
B = Latitude
R = Radius
r1 = radius at equator
r2 = radius at the poles
</code></pre>
<p>But your Haversine method is otherwise correct =D</p>

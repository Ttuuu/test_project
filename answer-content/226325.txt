<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>Create a dictionary mapping the old property IDs to the new ones, then do a lookup:</p>

<pre><code># I'm only showing few pairs of transformations for brevity.
# You'll need to expand this to include the rest
OLD_TO_NEW_IDS = {'2502': '95560',
                  '21489': '2502',
                  '660133': '21489',
                  '921010': '660133'}  

# Get the old ID
old_id = row.get('property_id')

# Do a lookup and get the new ID
new_id = OLD_TO_NEW_IDS.get(old_id, None)  # Will return None if the lookup failed to find the old ID

if new_id:  # Only update if the new ID is not None
    row.update({'property_id': new_id})
</code></pre>

<p>Having a long dictionary like that in your code is unfortunate though. You may want to consider storing it as a JSON or similar format to file, and loading/parsing it as needed.</p>

<li>the name <code>getStatus()</code> is not hinting in a useful direction</li>
<li>the number of winning pairs may easily exceed <code>Integer.MAX_VALUE</code><br>
(there may have been a reason for <code>Long</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>code alternative for <code>getStatus()</code> without concatenation, with one more <em>early out</em>:</p>

<pre><code>/** Adds &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;s from &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;charSet&lt;/code&gt;
 * @return size of the resulting &lt;code&gt;Set&amp;lt;Character&gt;&lt;/code&gt; */
static int accumulateChars(Set&lt;Character&gt; charSet, String a) {
    for (char c: a.toCharArray())
        charSet.add(c);
    return charSet.size();
}

static boolean all10(final String a, final String b) {
    if (a.length()+b.length() &lt; 10)
        return false;
    final Set&lt;Character&gt; charSet = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();
    return accumulateChars(charSet, a) &lt;= 10
        &amp;&amp; 10 == accumulateChars(charSet, b);
}
</code></pre>

<p>In each iteration of <code>winningLotteryTicket()</code>'s outer loop, <code>tickets[i]</code> stays the same for all the iterations of the inner loop, as does its contribution to <em>the set</em>.<br>
If you didn't literally concatenate strings, it was apparent that the same sets were created for the 2nd ticket's digits time and again - and the sets "checked for completeness" were the unions of the digit/char sets of tickets <em>i</em> and <em>j</em>:<br>
It looks advantageous to create each ticket's set once and for all and think hard about what can be done to reduce the number of set unions to evaluate - if ticket <em>i</em> consists of 2 distinct digits, only, there's no need to pair with any ticket consisting of no more than 7 distinct digits.<br>
If one ticket contains every digit, it is a winner paired with every other ticket â€¦</p>

<p>If and when coding that <em>proves</em> not fast enough, note that the digit sets are quite small and reconsider their representation.</p>

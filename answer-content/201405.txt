<p>For this simple method, I have a couple thoughts below. Your method seems sufficient; I don't think a completely different approach is necessary, although I question how often this method is called. If it is called more than once per page load/script run, it may be worth memoizing the value once obtained for better performance. </p>

<p>Good job utilizing the PHP 7 return type declaration.</p>

<hr>

<p>Because the method utilizes no instance properties or methods, it could be declared as <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.static.php#language.oop5.static.methods" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>static</code></a>, and possibly <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.visibility.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>public</code></a> so other code could use it, though maybe it is best to leave it as <code>private</code> until there is a legitimate need to make it otherwise.</p>

<hr>

<p>While the logic would need to be reversed, <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.substr-count.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>substr_count()</code></a> could be used instead of <a href="http://php.net/strpos" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>strpos()</code></a>. The difference is likely negligible but you need to ask yourself in which case would you rather have the method return as soon as the string is or isn't found...</p>

<pre><code>    foreach ($processStack as $process) {
        if (substr_count($process, 'docker')) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
</code></pre>

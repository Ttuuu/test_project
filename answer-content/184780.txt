<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>Do not set the <code>materialCode</code> to another string. I am not sure, but <code>NA</code> might also be a valid choice for <code>Material=&lt;value&gt;</code>. Instead, just set it to <code>null</code>.</p>

<p>As for the pattern itself, instead of searching for <code>[^,]</code> (anything except <code>,</code>), you should look for only the valid values. Based on the given examples, I'd assume that only alphanumericals are accepted. If there is a limit on the length, then you should specify that as well.</p>

<p>Since, you are only looking for values assigned to <code>Material</code> property; no need to store the word <code>Material</code> as a matched-group result.</p>

<p>For eg.</p>

<pre><code>Material=(?&lt;value&gt;[A-Z\d]{6})
</code></pre>

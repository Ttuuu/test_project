<p>I would rename <code>IPPacket</code> to <code>PacketParser</code>, and then create an <code>IPacketParser</code> interface that defines the parse method, but make it a regular method, not static. </p>

<p>Then, I would create a <code>TcpPacketParser</code> class and a <code>UdpPacketParser</code> class, which would eliminate the need for your switch logic within the parse method, thus there would be no need to return the <code>IPPacket</code> object. It's good to reduce cyclomatic complexity.</p>

<p>You'll probably want some way to access the parsed data, but I'm not sure what your use cases would be.</p>

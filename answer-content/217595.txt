<p>Yes, there is a cleaner way:</p>

<pre><code>if (a.major != b.major) {
    *result = a.major &lt; b.major;
} else if (a.minor != b.minor) {
    *result = a.minor &lt; b.minor;
} else if (a.patch != b.patch) {
    *result = a.patch &lt; b.patch;
} else {
    *result = a.build &lt; b.build;
}
return OKAY;
</code></pre>

<p>I reordered patch to come before build since that's <a href="https://semver.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">how it is usually done</a>. If your version scheme is different from this, good luck.</p>

<p>Instead of <code>unsigned char</code> I would choose <code>uint32_t</code> so that your code can handle versions like <code>1.0.20190415</code>. If you need to handle version numbers with millisecond timestamps, each version component would need to be <code>uint64_t</code>.</p>

<p>I recently answered a very similar question <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/201064/find-the-longest-ascending-subarray-from-a-given-array/201073#201073">here</a>. When I look at your code, it is very similar to my solution. 
The only suggestion for improvement I have for you is to try keeping three different variables for ascending/equal/descending, and updating them separately. However, I can't really say if that approach will be more efficient.</p>

<p>If I was really grasping at something to critique, I'd say that it'd be better if the function returned the smallest subsequence instead of printing it, but otherwise you've done a fantastic job!</p>

<p>I've found that if you are deleting rows in a range you need to create a <code>for loop</code> that starts at the bottom and works your way up.  When you are using the <code>for each loop</code> and try deleting an item out of that range and keep looping it destroys the reference to that range.  The next iteration will throw an error.</p>

<p>Here's an example, (I'm just pulling this out of my head and haven't tested it, but it should get you in the right direction)</p>

<pre><code>...
dim sh1Rows as integer  
dim myCell as range  

sh1Rows = sh.["A1"].end(xlDown).row

for i = sh1Rows to 1 step -1
    set myCell = sh["A1"].offset(0,i)
    if IsDate(myCell.value) and myCell.value &lt; Date - 456 Then
        sh2.cells(1,sh2.["A1"].end(xlDown) +1).entirerow = myCell.entirerow.value
        myCell.entirerow.delete
    end if
next
</code></pre>
    </div>

<p>I know this code has been around for ~5 years but still appears to work properly despite some DOM changes on these sites. You no doubt have learned a lot since posting this but I feel there are other things that haven't been mentioned yet/incorporated into the github script that could improve/simplify the code. </p>

<p>I recently have become accustomed to the github style UI of selecting lines to comment on by click and drag selection. I considered making such a userscript and might utilize some of this code. I started tinkering with it and noticed it has a lot of code in one giant function, as well as some large loops. I would recommend using separate functions for the event handlers- e.g. one for clicks on the buttons to add checkboxes, and another for clicks on the buttons to add checked lines to reviews. I know it isn't exactly a direct application of the Single Responsibility Principle but feels related.</p>

<p>The jQuery <a href="https://api.jquery.com/checked-selector/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>:checked</code> selector</a> can simplify the code to find 
checkboxes when copying to answer- from:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>var checkboxes = $("input.autoreview");
for (i = 0; i &lt; checkboxes.length; i++) {
    if (!$(checkboxes[i]).prop('checked')) {
        continue;
    }
    var checkbox = $(checkboxes[i]);
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>to this:</p>

<pre><code>var checkboxes = $("input.autoreview:checked");
for (i = 0; i &lt; checkboxes.length; i++) {
    var checkbox = $(checkboxes[i]);
</code></pre>

<p>A functional approach could be used instead using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Array.reduce()</code></a>.  jQuery does have similar functional methods like the <a href="https://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/filtering/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">filtering methods</a> like <a href="https://api.jquery.com/map/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>.map()</code></a> and <a href="https://api.jquery.com/each/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>.each()</code></a> which are similar to the native array methods like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Array.map()</code></a> though note the parameter differences between the jQuery equivalents.</p>

  <p><em>For example, in the code to figure out the indentation for a block I was thinking of how I would do it in Java, where I would use <code>block.stream().mapToInt(str -&gt; str.indexOf(str.trim())).min()</code>, can something similar be done here?</em></p>

<p>With <a href="/questions/tagged/ecmascript-6" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'ecmascript-6'" rel="tag">ecmascript-6</a> features things like dereferencing arrays can be simplified- i.e. using a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>for...of</code> loop</a>. And after reviewing your <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/q/190896/120114">Royal game of Ur code</a> I know you are familiar with arrow functions. Those can be used with functional methods like <code>Array.map()</code>, <code>Array.filter()</code>, <code>Array.reduce()</code> to simplify the syntax.</p>

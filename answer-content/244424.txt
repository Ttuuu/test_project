<p>Not sure about whether a solution could be more <code>Pythonic</code>, but I think it can be more efficient.  At present your code is iterating over each cell twice, before anything is printed.</p>
<p>I would suggest using a collection of possible winning strings.  You only need to iterate over the cells once and each time you encounter a <code>0</code> that row, col and if applicable, diagonal become invalid as a winning line.</p>
<p>After that, it's a simple matter of iterating over the strings and printing the ones that are valid.</p>

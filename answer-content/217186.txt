<p>I'm not a big fan of the functional solution for following reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>the pointless use of the <code>some()</code> method, because its callback always returns <code>false</code>. This is this possibly an error? The call would short-circuit, if <code>Boolean(ret = x)</code> weren't negated. But even then <code>some()</code> would be the wrong choice, because it's just used for short-circuiting. I believe <code>find()</code> would be a better choice.</p></li>
<li><p>the conditional expression together with <code>Boolean(...)</code> expressions are a bit if a crutch. The conditional expression seems to be only used to be shorter that an full <code>if</code>, but that requires <code>Boolean()</code>, so that it still returns a boolean value needed for <code>some()</code>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Using <code>find()</code> I've come up with</p>

<pre><code>const findDuplicate = lst =&gt; {
  const set = new Set();
  return lst.find(
    x =&gt; set.has(x) || !set.add(x)
  );
};
</code></pre>

<p>However I do admit it may be a bit cryptic. </p>

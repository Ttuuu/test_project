<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p><code>Remove(x)</code> deletes the element and then shifts every element up so it alone is an O(n) operation making your entire algorithm O(n^2). I actually wrote a <code>removeAtFast(x)</code> which swaps the item being removed and the last element then removes the last element normally. But you can't do this because it messes up the ordering.</p>

<p>I'd create a new array like what Pure Evil suggested. Just go through the elements and if you find 3 consecutive numbers skip 3 ahead and continue copying.</p>

<p>Edit: Also it would appear your code would fail the first example given in the assignment.</p>

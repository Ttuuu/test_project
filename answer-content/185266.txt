<p>First of all; your controller does too many things. </p>

<p>You may need to move your database related queries out of the controller. Repositories maybe? Also use Eloquent it is one of the most powerful way of Laravel.</p>

<p>methods <code>checkHash</code>, <code>unique</code>, <code>make</code> should not be in the controller.</p>

<p>Instead of facades you may inject <code>Illuminate\Http\Request</code> into the constructor and use request instead of input facades.</p>

<p>Move your business logic related functionalities into Services and inject these services into your controller. (method on constructor injection)</p>

<p>Instead of <code>Response::make(json_encode($abc))</code> you may use <code>response()-&gt;json($abc)</code></p>

<p>You need to follow a naming convention for your controller methods, variables and functions.</p>

<p>You need to indent your code.</p>

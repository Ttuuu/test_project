<p>The code makes the assumption that the runtime character set encodes letters contiguously in order.  Whilst this may be true on your system, it will fail on platforms that use [EBCDIC] or other codings with gaps between letters.  It will also fail for codings such as IS 8859, which have letters outside of <code>a..z</code>,<code>A..Z</code> (e.g. <code>Ã </code>).</p>

<p>We're missing the include of <code>&lt;cctype&gt;</code> which defines <code>std::isalpha</code>, <code>std::isspace</code> and <code>std::isalnum</code>  (all of which are misspelt in the code).</p>

<p>When reading input, always have a plan for what happens if the read fails.  So <code>std::cin &gt;&gt; key</code> needs to be <code>if (std::cin &gt;&gt; key)</code> with appropriate code in the <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> branches.</p>

<p>Consider working as a filter for standard input, rather than operating on just a single line.</p>

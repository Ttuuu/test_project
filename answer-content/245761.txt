<p>While Drew and Peter provide some useful techniques when dealing with complex components, this case cries out for the simplest solution possible.</p>
<pre><code>render () {
    if (showContainer) {
        return (
            &lt;Modal&gt;
                &lt;h3&gt;Random Child JSX&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;/Modal&gt;
        );
    } else {
        return (
            &lt;div className="parent"&gt;
                &lt;h3&gt;Random Child JSX&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        );
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Why would I start with this where there's so much repeated code? Simplicity is the first step in refactoring. Once you've simplified the problem, you can easily spot where you can make further refactorings once things grow in complexity. As written, this takes only a few seconds to read and understandâ€”something you'll do far more often than writing.</p>

<p>Follow some standards, use code linting <em>(for example ESLint)</em> and code formatting <em>(for example Prettier)</em>, try to prevent code duplication as much as possible, 
use design patterns and don't complex things. Those things will make your code more readable for others.</p>

<p>There is no right or wrong while the code works and it's easy to read.</p>

<p>Since it is required to have difference based on days I solved by removing time on dates and calculating difference by days count:</p>

<pre><code>end_date = end_date.date()
current_date = dt.date.today()
diff = (end_date - current_date).days
days_left = diff if diff &gt; 0 else 0
</code></pre>
    </div>

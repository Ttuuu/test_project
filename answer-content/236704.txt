<p>Always option 1. That way it will correctly use bold in cases when the browser doesn't support or can't download the fonts.</p>

<p>EDIT: One more point I've noticed just now: Don't use <code>bold</code> (700) for "semi-bold". Most font creators suggest a font-weight value for each variant. Usually it's 600 for "semi-bold" (and 500 for "medium").</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I don't see the point of passing <code>MAX_ITER</code>. Bisection is guaranteed to terminate in <span class="math-container">\$\log \dfrac{b - a}{TOL}\$</span> iterations.</p></li>
<li><p>I strongly advise against breaking the loop early at <code>math.isclose(f_c,0.0,abs_tol=1.0E-6)</code>. It only tells you that the value at <code>c</code> is close to <code>0</code>, but doesn't tell you <em>where</em> the root is (consider the case when the derivative at root is very small). After all, tolerance is passed for a reason!</p>

<p>If you insist on early termination, at least return the <code>(a, b)</code> interval as well. The caller deserves to know the precision.</p></li>
<li><p>You may want to do this test right before returning (like, is there a root at all):</p>

<pre><code>if math.isclose(f_c,0.0,abs_tol=1.0E-6):
    return None
return c
</code></pre>

<p>but I'd rather let the caller worry about that.</p></li>
<li><p><code>abs</code> in <code>abs(b - a)</code> seems excessive.</p>

<pre><code>if a &gt; b:
    a, b = b, a
</code></pre>

<p>at the very beginning of <code>bisection</code> takes care of it once and forever.</p></li>
<li><p><code>(a + b)</code> may overflow. <code>c = a + (b - a)/2</code> is more prudent.</p></li>
<li><p>I don't see where <code>is_equal(a,b)</code> is ever used.</p></li>
</ul>

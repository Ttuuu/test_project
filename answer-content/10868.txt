<p>It seems to me, that according to your use of <code>Course</code> the code would be better if you:</p>

<ol>
<li>add parameters to ctor (course name, and prerequisites) </li>
<li>make courses <code>Comparable</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Then you can verify if the course name is in proper format and split it by parts (name and number) once and forever, and implement courses comparition logic inside the class, avoiding ugly code in client's classes. It will significantly improve encapsulation and release client's code from details of course class.</p>

<p>If ctor finds that something wrong with course name/number, whatever, it may throw an exception.</p>

<p>A few observations:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I would never write <code>x += 1;</code> if I wanted to increment <code>x</code>. I think this is confusing and more prone to error than writing <code>++x;</code>. Of course, there should be no difference for the compiler.</p></li>
<li><p>In <code>count_items</code>, do you really want to return 1 even if there are no matches? Be as it may, you don't have to write an explicit loop as this is equivalent to using <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/count" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>std::count</code></a>, i.e., you could just write </p>

<pre><code>std::size_t count_items(const std::string &amp;line, char separator) {
    return std::count(line.cbegin(), line.cend(), separator) + 1;
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>I find your split function <code>parse_line</code> quite difficult to read. There are several alternatives to this including many in Boost (Tokenizer, boost::algorithm::split, ...).</p></li>
</ul>

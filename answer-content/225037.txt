<h3>Sanity check</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.shellcheck.net/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Shellcheck.net</a> reports a couple of issues.
I will not call them out one by one, I suggest to review and fix.</p>

<h3>Incorrectly saving empty bookmark</h3>

<p>When there are no bookmarks, <code>bm_save</code> will write a single null byte to the file.
Then, when you list bookmarks the empty entry shows up at index 0.</p>

<p>I suggest to add a check before actually writing to the file:</p>

<pre><code>[[ ${#BOOKMARKS[@]} != 0 ]] || return 0
</code></pre>

<h3>Do not raise error when file does not exist</h3>

<p><code>bm_load</code> raises an error if the file does not exist.
Is that the intended behavior?
I don't think so, because <code>bm_save</code> happily writes to the file.
Perhaps <code>bm_load</code> should be more forgiving.</p>

<h3>Overriding <code>IFS</code></h3>

<p>As <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/716/l0b0">@l0b0</a> already pointed out, it's good to prefix with <code>IFS=...</code> just the command where you want the modified value, when possible (usually).
Another alternative is to use <code>local IFS=...</code>:
the modified value will only be visible within the function,
so no need to worry about backup and restore.</p>

<h3>Unnecessary overriding of <code>IFS</code></h3>

<p>In <code>bm_compact</code> I don't see a reason to override <code>IFS</code> to recreate <code>BOOKMARKS</code>.</p>

<p>Btw, at first I didn't understand the purpose of this function.
I think naming it <code>bm_compact_indexes</code> would have made it click.</p>

<h3>What is <code>REPLY</code>?</h3>

<p>I can find what is <code>REPLY</code> if I look at <code>help read</code>.
I think it will be easier to understand the code if you specify a descriptive variable name with <code>read</code>.</p>

<h3>Can you use Bash 4?</h3>

<p>Where there is Bash, there's usually Bash 4.
Using <code>mapfile</code> you could replace the loop reading <code>BOOKMARKS</code> in <code>bm_load</code> with:</p>

<pre><code>mapfile -d '' -t BOOKMARKS &lt; "$bmfile"
</code></pre>

<h3>Avoid <code>echo -e</code></h3>

<p>The flags of <code>echo</code> don't work reliably in all systems, so I suggest to avoid it.
Your alternatives are using <code>printf</code> (which is not POSIX compliant), or (in your specific case) to embed tab characters in the string.</p>

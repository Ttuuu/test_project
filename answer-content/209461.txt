<li>dont prefix your code, <code>bt</code> looks like button... you can just name <code>Format format</code> and be all set. (Clean Code - Uncle Bob)...</li>
<li>Break down your ideas into smaller functions (Single Responsibility Principle). like <code>btFormat = btApp.Formats.Open("\"" + input + "\"", false, "");</code> can be in its own method with a <a href="https://medium.com/coding-skills/clean-code-101-meaningful-names-and-functions-bf450456d90c" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><em>meaningful name</em></a>. Your <code>btMessageText</code>, can be set from private function called <code>CreateVerificationMessage</code>...   </li>
<li>what exactly are you going to do with <code>btMessageText</code>? Were you supposed to write that to the console?</li>
</ol>

<p>Look for "intent" and separate those ideas into functions, methods and classes instead of creating a <a href="https://sourcemaking.com/antipatterns/the-blob" rel="nofollow noreferrer">God Class</a> to do everything...</p>

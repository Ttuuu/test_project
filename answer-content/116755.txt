<p>A few comments:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I’m not sure why you’re so keen to suppress any and all output from your RUN commands. That information can be useful when you’re trying to work out why your image hasn’t built properly. It can be a bit verbose when it goes fine, but it’s useful when it fails.</p>

<p>(Docker’s inbuilt networking is sometimes a bit flakey for me, and <code>apt-get</code> and <code>yum</code> just fail when trying to retrieve indexes. Being able to see their output as they can’t connect out is always useful.)</p></li>
<li><p>No comments! A Dockerfile should be treated like any other piece of code. There should be comments explaining why it was written this way, what the intended outcome is, and so on. This file could be quite hard to maintain.</p>

<p>For example, there are a couple of hard-coded URLs to mirrors that pull tarfiles. Here are some maintenance questions that comments might help me answer:</p>

<ul>
<li>When should I rev the version numbers in those URLs? I don’t want to be getting insecure versions of packages.</li>
<li>Where should I look for an alternative if those mirrors go away?</li>
<li>What are these packages for? When can I know if I don’t need them any more?</li>
</ul>

<p></p></li>
<li><p>Each line in a Dockerfile adds a new layer to the image’s filesystem, so you want to avoid creating unnecessary layers. For example, four lines at the top of the first block can be condensed into two:</p>

<pre><code>RUN mkdir -p /install-files/apache
WORKDIR /install-files/apache
</code></pre>

<p>You could also use the <code>-O</code> flag of wget to avoid having to cut out the first <code>WORKDIR</code> line.</p></li>
<li><p>You’re installing nano and wget with apt-get, but it’s not obvious why. I feel like the former could be replaced with curl (which is built-in), and if you ever need a text editor inside your container, install it when you need it. Don’t fill your container with things you don’t need.</p></li>
</ul>

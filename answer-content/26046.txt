<li><p>Try not to use <code>/* this kind of comment * /</code> at the end of a single line  (like you did on line 5).</p>

<pre><code>//use this kind of comment as often as possible
</code></pre>

<p>Developers like to use <code>/* this kind of comment */</code> to comment-out blocks of code sometimes. So using them on a single line can be irritating.</p></li>
<li><p>On line 10, you say</p>

<pre><code>while ( true )
</code></pre>

<p>Infinite loops are usually not a good idea.  It is better to have some exit condition.  If the function <code>makeReservation()</code> returned a bool, you could use it for your loop exit condition.</p></li>

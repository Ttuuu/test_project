<p>Since you're concerned with performance, I'll add a point to  @Frank's review regarding the use of C++-standard-library maps:</p>

<h3>When map access performance is important, don't use <code>std::map</code> nor <code>std::unordered_map</code></h3>

<p>Note that map access does <em>not</em> seem to be the cause of your problem here; but if it were the case, you would do well not to use the standard ordered map (<code>std::map</code>) and unordered map (`std::unordered_map) as they are <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42588264/">known to be quite slow</a>. They are perfectly usable and recommended for most settings though.</p>

<p>Performance-improving alternatives include You should use one of several <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/3300525/1593077">alternatives to them</a>, such as Google's sparse or dense hash, Intel TBB's maps, khash, uthash and others mentioned at the link.</p>

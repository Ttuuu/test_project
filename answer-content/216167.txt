<p>Note: below is my opinion and should not be taken as a source of truth.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><code>Main</code> should be clear of any logic except starting the program or parsing the arguments (<code>args</code> not user input). For me this comes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle" rel="nofollow noreferrer">SRP</a>. </p></li>
<li><p>Try to abstract reading/writing to some injectable read and write classes. This gives you both possibility of further extension (away from console) and testability. </p></li>
<li><p>As mentioned in comments, drop static methods when they are not absolutely needed advantage of doing that is the fact that your code becomes more testable (without <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/isolating-code-under-test-with-microsoft-fakes?view=vs-2017" rel="nofollow noreferrer">moles</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>'Menu' from which user selects the data should be generated dynamically for possible extensions or getting the options from config/db.</p></li>
<li><p>Phone number should be a string. It's validation should be extracted to some helper class/function because you are repeating yourself. For validation regex see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/18091377/3809977">this link</a> </p></li>
<li><p>There are many duplicates in the code, maybe you could try to abstract some parts to methods. </p></li>
<li><p><code>IsValueValid</code> method is not nice, it does not follow SRP. Try to split it into two.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Bonus  - things that may not be required but would show an effort:</p>

<ol>
<li>Dictionary storage (some kind of database abstraction would be nice)</li>
<li>Logging - I haven't seen any production app without logging</li>
<li>Tests - it's always good to show some test evidence.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Observations</h3>

<ul>
<li>Your algorithm uses a brute force with backtracking and history, which is a nice verification method to get all paths that don't include any cycles. </li>
<li>As you can see, there are 2 solutions. Each solution requires to use a flow from one bottle to the other. One bottle is the main bottle that you fill with water and move its content to the other.

<ol>
<li>(0,0) - (3,0) - (0,3) - (3,3) - (2,4) - (2,0) - (0,<strong>2</strong>)</li>
<li>(0,0) - (0,4) - (3,1) - (0,1) - (1,0) - (1,4) - (3,<strong>2</strong>)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>I'm surprised to see your brute force does not exit early in the top path, starting with filling the 3 liter bottle, when reaching <code>(0, 2)</code>. Is this as designed?</li>
</ul>

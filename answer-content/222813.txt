<p>Nice, clean and functional.<br>
Still, there are a few things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you don't have to declare a special member-function, just don't:<br>
<code>bad_function_call::bad_function_call()</code>, <code>callable::~callable()</code>, and <code>function::~function()</code> are superfluous.</p></li>
<li><p>If you actually have to declare a special member-function, explicitly default it in-class where that is enough:<br>
<code>callable_base::~ callable_base()</code>, and <code>function::function()</code> should be explicitly defaulted.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider investing in small-object-optimization. Yes, it <em>will</em> make the code a bit more complicated, but on the flip-side it should result in much improved efficiency. Also, <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/functional/function/function" rel="nofollow noreferrer">it is mandatory</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider using the null-object-pattern to pare down on checks. There is considerable synergy with the previous point.</p></li>
<li><p>You can replace (most of) your uses of <code>static_cast&lt;bool&gt;()</code> with double-negation.</p></li>
<li><p>Personally, I prefer a bigger indentation-step, but whatever. Also, not having colon <code>:</code> followed by any whitespace takes some getting used to.</p></li>

<p>If you wish to keep your implementation scheme, I only have one large critique:</p>

<p>Names are important</p>

<p>Your naming scheme should allow a 3rd party to understand your code from a cursory glance. You have a lot of sneaky implementations tucked into your functions that aren't expressed in your naming convention.</p>

<p>All of your operations are stateful, which is technically ok but you use a lot of verbage that makes it sound like they're functional operations with actual <code>return</code> values. All of your functions act on stateful variables. Your naming convention should reflect this through the use of verb phrases, as opposed to nouns.</p>

<p><code>resetStorage</code>: A good variable name. It is a verb that acts on <code>localStorage</code></p>

<p><code>getStorage</code>: Misleading. The traditional usage of the verb <code>get</code> is to retrieve a value or perform a computation (and <code>return</code> it). You are assigning <code>this.healthScore</code>. <code>getStorage</code> doesn't even have a <code>return</code> value. A more apt name would be something more like <code>setHealthScoreFromLocalStorage</code>.</p>

<p><code>toZero</code>: What exactly is being set to zero? From the rest of your code (looking at <code>resetStorage</code>) I can infer that the value of <code>0</code> is the default value. It should be more along the lines of <code>resetHealthScore</code> or <code>clearHealthScore</code>.</p>

<p><code>returnMessage</code>: It is updating <code>this.message</code>. So something more like <code>updateHealthMessage</code>?</p>

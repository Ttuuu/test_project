<p>To compare two poker hands, you can just compute their <em>rank</em> individually and then compare the ranks. This makes comparing very easy.</p>

<p>To compute the rank of a hand, first classify it to one of the rows in the picture you posted. The result of this classification could look like:</p>

<ul>
<li>royalflush ace</li>
<li>royalflush 5</li>
<li>pair 5, kickers ace jack 4 (note that the kickers are sorted already)</li>
<li>highcard ace, kickers queen 10 7 3</li>
</ul>

<p>These results can be written as lists of numbers:</p>

<ul>
<li>10, 14 (the 10 means royal flush, the 14 means ace)</li>
<li>10, 5</li>
<li>2, 5, 14, 11, 4</li>
<li>1, 14, 12, 10, 7, 3</li>
</ul>

<p>To compare these lists, just compare their elements pairwise.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can also encode the complete hand as a single number. Each of the above numbers is less than 100, so you can write the numbers like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>10 14 00 00 00 00 = 101400000000</li>
<li>10 05 00 00 00 00</li>
<li>+2 05 14 11 04 00</li>
<li>+1 14 12 10 07 03</li>
</ul>

<p>And these are trivial to compare.</p>

<p>By organizing your code like this, there is only one function you have to test thoroughly, namely the computation of the rank. This makes the code much shorter.</p>

<p>Returning values by variable is 3-10 times faster than capturing an <code>echo</code> with <code>$( )</code>.  Your temp variable is already global.  Just name it something similar to what the surrounding function is named. </p>

<p>Whitespace and comments affect bash performance negatively.  It's not a big penalty, just something to be aware of.</p>

<p>A regular expression can do the "last two path components" extraction very compactly. </p>

<pre><code>cwd() {
  cwd=$PWD
  [[ $cwd/ == $HOME/* ]] &amp;&amp; cwd=~${cwd#$HOME}
  [[ $cwd =~ ./([^/]+/[^/]+)$ ]] &amp;&amp; cwd=${BASH_REMATCH[1]}
}

PROMPT_COMMAND=cwd

PS1="<span class="math-container">\$cwd \$</span>"
</code></pre>

<p>I'd say not to count the tilde as a path component: it's only one extra character that carries a lot of information, well worth the single column.   The regex is then:</p>

<pre><code>  [[ $cwd =~ (..|[^~])/([^/]+/[^/]+)$ ]] &amp;&amp; cwd=${BASH_REMATCH[2]}
</code></pre>

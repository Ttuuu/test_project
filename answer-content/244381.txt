<p>I agree with the accepted answer. An alternative way to frame this is a <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/advanced.html#multiindex-advanced-indexing" rel="nofollow noreferrer">multi-index</a>, with indices of <code>id</code> and <code>variable</code>.</p>
<p>You will then effectively have three-dimensional data, where the first dimension is an integral ID, the second dimension is a categorical variable name, and the third dimension is your value.</p>
<p>You could extend this concept even further, with dimensions of <code>id</code>, <code>variable</code> (only to contain <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>), <code>subscript</code> (0 or 1, whatever that represents in your context), and <code>value</code>. Certain indexing operations will be made easier by this approach.</p>

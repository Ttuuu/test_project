<p>at first glance I found a couple of things that might give you issues</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>IF Strike = 1
BEGIN
    SET @Strikes = 1;
    SET @Balls = 0;
END
ELSE
BEGIN
    SET @Strikes = 0;
    SET @Balls = 1;
END
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>IIRC, you can perform 4 foul hits before you are considered "out", and that a foul hit on the first and second pitch are also counted as "Strikes" but not the third foul hit. going through this logic will give you a false "ball" count because it is a foul but not a strike.</p>

<p>I also noticed</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>IF Contact = 0
BEGIN
    SET @Contact = 1;
END
ELSE
BEGIN
    SET @Contact = 0;
END
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>I assumed that <code>@Contact</code> was your "hits" but I tried to go through the logic and I am a bit confused.  If <code>Contact = 0</code> means to me that there wasn't a hit, but you set the variable to true (<code>SET @Contact = 1;</code>) </p>

<p>Again IIRC, not every contact with the ball counts as a "hit"</p>

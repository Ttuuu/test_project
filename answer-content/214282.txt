<p>Why instantiate an object of class <code>I</code> if the only methods called are static? It appears that only private member variables <em>that are never mutated</em> are accessed. Instead of creating an object of class <code>I</code> just to pass to the static methods, you could use <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.constants.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">class constants</a> or if you really want them kept private, use make those private variables static. </p>

<p>That way, the line the instance (i.e. <code>$i = new I();</code>) can be removed and the parameters (e.g. <code>$i</code>) can be removed from the method signatures, since they are no longer needed. It is up to you if you keep the constructor and destructor (e.g. if you end up needing to instantiate objects of that type then maybe you want those).</p>

<hr>

<p>The class name <code>I</code> is a little vague/non-descriptive. Perhaps a more appropriate name would be something like <code>StockController</code> or <code>StockScraper</code>. Similarly the method name <code>symbs</code> could be better named - perhaps something like <code>getSymbols</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>What does the value <code>100</code> signify when used in that <code>symbs</code> method? Were you using 100 or more lines in your <em>symbols.md</em> file? If 100 is a special value, it should be stored in a constant or private static property.</p>

<p>I tried using the sample file which has 47 lines and thus when I tried the code, nothing was added to the array returned by <code>symbs()</code>. Perhaps the logic needs to be updated to handle array lengths lower than 100. </p>

<hr>

<p>I presume there is a typo on this line:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>$this-&gt;symbolsPath = __DIR__ . "/../../config/symobls.md";
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>given you gave a sample </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example of <code>symobls.md</code>:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So perhaps that line should be:</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;symbolsPath = __DIR__ . "/../../config/symbols.md";
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>The last few lines of <code>scrapeAllStocks()</code> uses <code>fopen()</code>, <code>fwrite()</code> and <code>fclose()</code> to write the output file - is there a reason not to use <a href="https://php.net/file_put_contents" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>file_put_contents()</code></a> instead of all of those? Maybe you aren't familiar with that function, or else there is some write issue I am unaware of.</p>

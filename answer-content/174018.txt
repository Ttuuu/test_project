  <p>Any suggestion to make it faster?</p>

<p>No, not really, it looks good as it is.</p>

<p>The inner loop termination condition involves division: <code>j &lt;= n / i</code>. You're hoping the optimizing (-O3) compiler hoists the constant out of the loop. I'm willing to take the bet that it does get hoisted, that there's no need to explicitly assign a temp variable.</p>

<p>The <code>j * i</code> expression doesn't need to use multiplication -- addition would suffice, using something like <code>j</code> or <code>n += i</code>. Depending on details of your CPU, that might help, or not.</p>

<p>Be sure to read the relevant RFCs that govern e-mail headers!  Specifically:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822#section-1.2.2" rel="noreferrer">RFC 2822, Section 1.2.2</a>: Header names are case-insensitive.</li>
<li><p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822#section-2.2.3" rel="noreferrer">RFC 2822, Section 2.2.3</a>: Header fields may be line-folded:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>2.2.3. Long Header Fields</h3>
  
  <p>Each header field is logically a single line of characters
  comprising the field name, the colon, and the field body.  For
  convenience however, and to deal with the 998/78 character
  limitations per line, the field body portion of a header field can
  be split into a multiple line representation; this is called
  "folding".  The general rule is that wherever this standard allows
  for folding white space (not simply WSP characters), a CRLF may be
  inserted before any WSP.  For example, the header field:</p>

<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>Subject: This is a test
</code></pre>
  
  <p>can be represented as:</p>

<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>Subject: This
 is a test
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Since your <code>sed</code> operates on the raw representation of the header, you will miss headers that are logically longer than <code>subject_length</code> characters long, but start with a physically short line.</p>

<p>What is your rationale for developing this filter?  Is the application that processes the incoming messages unable to handle long subject texts, or is it unable to handle long physical lines?  If it's the latter, maybe all you need is a filter that performs line folding, rather than truncation.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2047" rel="noreferrer">RFC 2047</a>: Encoding mechanisms for non-ASCII headers.  A logical subject line</p>

<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>Subject: this is some text
</code></pre>

<p>… could also be represented physically as</p>

<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>Subject: =?iso-8859-1?q?this=20is=20some=20text?=
</code></pre>

<p>… or by many other representations.  Is your limit based on the number of bytes in the raw representation, the number of bytes in the UTF-8 representation, the number of Unicode characters, or something else?  You didn't specify clearly.  If you are truncating the raw representation, you might truncate a MIME-encoded header at a point that makes it syntactically invalid.</p></li>

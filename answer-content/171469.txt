<p>The biggest issue I see with your code is your ability to extend it effectively. I would recomend you store a lot of you data in a format like <a href="http://json.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">JSON</a>. So you could create for a <code>Monster</code> something like:</p>

<pre><code>{
  "name" : "Ooogle",
  "attack" : 20,
  "defense" : 30,
  ...
}, 
{
  "name" : "Argle",
  "attack" : 31,
  "defense" : 20
  ...
}, 
</code></pre>

<p>There actually may be is a better way to represent this with JSON. I'm not a JSON expert. The point I'm trying to make is this will help clean up a lot monster creation code, and room creation that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>    switch (random) {
        case 1:
            description = "A dark corridor with creeping, animated vines.";
            numOfMonsters = 1;
            //lighting = false;
            break;
        case 2:
            description = "A single lantern lays on the floor, illuminating"
                    + " a skeleton of a past explorer. Two pairs of eyes "
                    + "can be seen.";
            numOfMonsters = 1;
            //lighting = true;
            break;
        case 3:
            description = "A green, floral room full of massive plants.";
            numOfMonsters = 1;
            //lighting = true;
            break;
        /*case 4:
                description = "a giant dragon";
                numOfMonsters = 1;
                isBossRoom = true;
                break;      
            case 5:
                description = "";
                numOfMonsters = 1;
                break;
            case 6:
                description = "";
                numOfMonsters = 1;
                break;
            case 7:
                description = "";
                numOfMonsters = 1;
                break;
            case 8:
                description = "";
                numOfMonsters = 1;
                break;
            case 9:
                description = "";
                numOfMonsters = 1;
                break;
            case 10:
                description = "";
                numOfMonsters = 1;
                break;*/
</code></pre>

<p>There might be even better ways than JSON, but it is definitely a push in the right direction as it isolates the data models from your code.</p>

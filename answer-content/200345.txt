<h2>Check for invalid outputs, and regenerate them.</h2>
<p>It's possible that you'll produce an output that's reserved for a particular purpose, such as loopback (<code>127.0.0.1</code> or <code>::1</code>) or broadcast (<code>255.255.255.255</code>, <code>ff02::1</code>, <code>ff02::2</code>).  Build in knowledge of such addresses, and if you find you've produced one, then replace it.  You can do that recursively:</p>
<pre><code>def make_address(v):
    address = random_ip(v)
    if is_reserved(address):
        return make_address(v)
    return address
   
</code></pre>
    </div>

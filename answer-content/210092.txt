<p>Your check-out <code>daysStayed</code> and <code>totalPrice</code> code is very verbose.</p>

<pre><code>            daysStayed = checkOutDay - checkInDay

            if (e[2] == 'Dog'): 
               # Assume same day checkout rate is also the rate of one day
                if (daysStayed == 0):
                    totalPrice = roomRates['dogs'] * daysStayed + roomRates['dogs']
                    print("Total days stayed: ", daysStayed)
                    print("Total: ", totalPrice)
                    totalPriceStr = ("$" + str(totalPrice))
                elif (daysStayed &gt;= 1):
                    totalPrice = roomRates['dogs'] * daysStayed
                    print("Total days stayed: ", daysStayed)
                    print("Total price: $", totalPrice)
</code></pre>

<p>If check-in and check-out are on the same day, the <code>daysStayed = 0</code>.  You want to charge for at least one day, so you: <code>totalPrice = roomRates['dogs'] * daysStayed + roomRates['dogs']</code>.  But <code>daysStayed</code> is zero, so the first half of that expression is useless.  The <code>if:</code> and <code>else:</code> clauses contain essentially the same code.  The only difference is you want a minimum of 1 day.  So ...</p>

<pre><code>            daysStayed = max(checkOutDay - checkInDay, 1)

            if (e[2] == 'Dog'): 
                totalPrice = roomRates['dogs'] * daysStayed
                print("Total days stayed: ", daysStayed)
                print("Total price: $", totalPrice)
</code></pre>

<p>You charge cats the bird's rate:</p>

<pre><code>             elif (e[2] == 'Cat'): 
                 # Assume same day checkout rate is also the rate of one day
                 if (daysStayed == 0):
                    #...
                 elif (daysStayed &gt;= 1):
                    totalPrice = roomRates['birds'] * daysStayed
                    #....
</code></pre>

<p>Why even separate the cat/dog/bird/rodent into separate <code>if .. elif .. elif ..</code> statements?</p>

<pre><code>            daysStayed = max(checkOutDay - checkInDay, 1)

            look_up_key = e[2].lower() + 's'             # Or choose better keys

            totalPrice = roomRates[look_up_key] * daysStayed

            print("Total days stayed: ", daysStayed)
            print("Total price: $", totalPrice)
</code></pre>

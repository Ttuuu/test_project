<p>I'm a bit surprised this solution passes a medium level question,
given that it's a brute-force implementation with quadratic time complexity (consider for example a long decreasing sequence as input).</p>

<p>That said, a couple of simple improvements are possible:</p>

<ul>
<li>The condition <code>if (!myArr.length) { return 0; }</code> is unnecessary.</li>
<li>Instead of the <code>.some(...)</code> call with its side effect, it would be cleaner to use <code>findIndex</code>: <code>return myArr.findIndex(x =&gt; x &gt; t) + 1</code></li>
</ul>

<p>And, as an exercise, I recommend to find an alternative algorithm that has linear time.</p>

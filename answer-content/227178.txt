<p>High powers of small-magnitude numbers tend toward zero.  When you get subnormal floating-point numbers, then there's a heavy speed penalty; this point is reached sooner with <code>double</code> than with <code>long double</code> (and reached even sooner still using <code>float</code>).</p>

<p>A simple way to improve the speed may be to disable subnormals for this function - e.g. compile with <code>g++ -ffast-math</code> to push subnormal numbers to zero.</p>

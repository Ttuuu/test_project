<p>Thanks for sharing your code.</p>

<p>The big issue with it is  <strong>Naming</strong></p>

<p>Finding good names is the hardest part in programming, so always take your time to think about the names of your identifiers.</p>

<h2>Java Naming Conventions.</h2>

<p>Please read (and follow) the
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconventions-135099.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Java Naming Conventions</a>. 
The parameter names should start with lowercase letters.</p>

<h2>avoid single letter names</h2>

<p>In Java the length of identifier names names is virtually unlimited. There is no penalty in any way for long identifier names. 
So don't be stingy with letters when choosing names.</p>

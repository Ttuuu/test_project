<p>Use <code>var</code> during local variable declarations when the right-hand side makes the type obvious. This saves you extra typing every time you want to change type. You should also use <code>var</code> when declaring loop index.</p>

<p>Single-letter variables, unless used in loop indices, are needlessly confusing for a maintenance programmer. Use descriptive names. There's a reason one of the first steps an obfuscator makes is to use single-letter variable names.</p>

<p>Lastly, you've misspelled <code>pointIndexsToKeep</code></p>

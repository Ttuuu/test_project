<h2>Selenium</h2>
<p>Selenium imposes a lot of overhead and complexity that you don't need to deal with. If you needed to scrape, use <code>requests</code> + <code>beautifulsoup</code>; but you don't: StackExchange has a <a href="https://api.stackexchange.com/">good API</a>, so you should strongly prefer using that. It will get you results more efficiently and the results will be more accurate and less fragile.</p>

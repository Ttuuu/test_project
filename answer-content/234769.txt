<p>For security, bind user supplied values when including them in a query.</p>

<p>Here's what that could look like using mysqli and the information provided
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/mysqli-stmt.bind-param.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.php.net/manual/en/mysqli-stmt.bind-param.php</a></p>

<pre><code>// renamed `textt` to `text`
$stmt = $mysqli-&gt;prepare('INSERT INTO `info` (`username`,`email`,`text`) VALUES (?,?,?);');
$stmt-&gt;bind_param($username, $email, $text);
$stmt-&gt;execute();
$stmt-&gt;close();
</code></pre>

<p>Here's what that would look like using PDO, should that connection be considered.

<p>Perhaps consider renaming your column <code>textt</code> to something more descriptive?</p>

<p>Also, normally, you'd want to provide some validation on user supplied input to prevent bots and help prevent user error.</p>

<p>e.g. for the email address:</p>

<pre><code>if (filter_var($_POST['email'], FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {
  $email = $_POST['email'];
} else {
  // often handled with a message or alert funciton
  echo 'Please enter a valid email';
  $error = true;
}
</code></pre>

<p>e.g. for the username:</p>

<pre><code>if(!ctype_space($_POST['username'])) {
    $username = trim($_POST['username']);
} else {
    // as before often handled by a message/alert function
    echo 'Please provide a valid email address';
    $error = true;
}
</code></pre>

<p>It's often helpful to store the IP address of the requester. The following can be spoofed, and there are better functions out there, but it is often better than nothing.</p>

<pre><code>$ip_address = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
</code></pre>

<p>There are solutions to help ensure it's not a bot completing your form, e.g. reCAPTCHA and honey pots. They're not always appropriate from a UX, UI, security standpoint, but I feel that should be mentioned as well. </p>

<p>I hope this was helpful!</p>

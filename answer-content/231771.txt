<p>Regarding <code>min(string)</code>: Python exceeding your expectations. It happens a lot.</p>

<h3>assert</h3>

<p>All assert statements can be disabled with a switch to the interpreter, and sometimes are. Therefore, they're not suitable for flow control. I think you should replace:</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>for character in string:
    assert ord(character) &lt;= 127
</code></pre>

<p>With:</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>for character in string:
    if ord(character) &gt; 127:
        raise ValueError(f"Character {character} is out of range.")
</code></pre>

<p>or to optimize with a generator instead of the loop (requires Python 3.8+ if you want to report the character that violates the condition):</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>if any(ord(character := char) &gt; 127 for char in string):
    raise ValueError(f"Character {character} out of range")
</code></pre>

<p>(Thanks to @Graipher for proper handling of the := token in 3.8+, which I hadn't worked with myself yet.)</p>

<p>That's all I can see being wrong here, though.</p>

<p>I only have one addition to make to John's excellent review...</p>

<p>When you have a strictly formatted <code>$format == 2</code> scenario where no zero padding is necessary, you can avoid prepping, parsing, or even generating DateTime objects. So long as the delimiters are the same throughout, they do not matter.</p>

<p>Comparing the values as strings will offer the same sorting behavior with an absolute minimum expense.</p>

<pre><code>return $date1 &lt;=&gt; $date2;
</code></pre>

<p>...for this reason, <code>sort()</code> is actually all that you need in this one/specific scenario.</p>

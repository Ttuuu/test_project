<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>Your code is not bad. You use functional style to loop through the data, which is good. But inside the loop you do not have to check with if-elseif-elseif, as this is not solid when it comes to many many cases. 
Maybe it would be better to use a map object to guide the process of matching data.</p>

<pre><code>getSelectedItemsIds = selectedItemsList =&gt; {
    const keyNamesMap = {
        projectIds: "PROJECT",
        subjectGroupIds: "SUBJECT_GROUP",   
        subjectIds: "SUBJECT"
    };
    let selectedItems = [];

    Object.keys(keyNamesMap).map( k =&gt; {
        selectedItemsList[k].map ( id =&gt; {
            selectedItems.push (
                {
                    type: keyNamesMap[k],
                    id: id
                }
            );
        });       
    });
    return selectedItems;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This way it is more clear and more easy to add another type.</p>
    </div>

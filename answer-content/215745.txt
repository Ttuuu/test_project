<p>To add a constructive suggestion to this, it is apparent to me you are implementing a glorified KV (key-value) store; value being JSON is of no consequence. So why not use something that is already designed for this?</p>

<li>Any flavor of DB with hash-type storage</li>

<p>This would or at least should rid you of concurrency concerns (well, not entirely, you will still quite possibly get deadlocks but at least integrity is preserved by any of the above suggestions).</p>

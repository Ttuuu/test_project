<p>Something I would immediately recommend from looking at your code is that you should not put random whitespace in your code. Whenever you space out random parts, you should ensure you do so with good reason - such as splitting up various logical parts of your codebase.</p>

<p>Also, you want to avoid writing code like this</p>

<pre><code>for (CollideableObject object : objects) if (!handler.getObjects().contains(object)) remove(object);
</code></pre>

<p>Having too many characters in one line makes it hard to decipher what a particular line of code is doing.</p>

<p>If you instead used whitespace and braces, you could make it easier for someone viewing to be able to tell exactly what is happening specifically inside the for loop without having to scroll from left to right to see the code more clearly.</p>

<p>Please let me know if you have any other questions. Thank you.</p>

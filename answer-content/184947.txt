<p>You're making the backup directly available in your web root. For temporary files you should normally use <code>mktemp</code>.</p>

<p>NB I'm assuming that <code>/var/www/html</code> is not <em>directly</em> mapped to a <code>DirectoryRoot</code>: if it <em>is</em> visible, that's even worse.</p>

<pre><code>mysqldump -u root -p --all-databases &gt; /var/www/html/db-$(date +\%F-\%T).sql
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, <code>mktemp</code>.</p>

<p>Secondly, this is interactive: <code>-p</code> requires you to be there to write the password. It might be more useful to have a script which could run with cron, although this would mean storing the password somewhere. In that case you should definitely create a new user with restricted rights who can dump the database but not change it.</p>

<p>Thirdly, experience has taught me to play it safe by adding <code>--hex-blob</code>. I have had difficulty restoring when this option was not used and encoding differences mangled the blobs.</p>

<p>Yikes. If <code>zip</code> crashes for any reason you've just lost the old backup as well as the new one. I would prefer to have a <code>backups</code> directory (not under <code>/var/www/html</code>) and move <code>html-${TIMESTAMP}.zip</code> and <code>db-${TIMESTAMP}.zip</code> there. If you're worried about filling up your disk with backups, you can write a script to delete old ones.</p>

<p>A further advantage of having timestamped names is that you can identify the relative age of the offsite backups (you do have offsite copies, right?) without using <code>zip</code> to list the contents.</p>

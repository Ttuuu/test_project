<ul>
<li>Don't define pi and twopi yourself. They should be available from math.h as <code>M_PI</code> and <code>M_2_PI</code> if you're in the GNU stack.</li>
<li>Defining functions as <code>inline</code> is more or less useless. The compiler will do this (or not) as it sees fit, and generally knows better than you on when it's beneficial.</li>
<li><code>GetMin()</code> should be <code>GetMin() const</code>. Same for <code>GetRange</code>, <code>GetProcessedVoiceValue</code>, and anything that doesn't modify a class member.</li>
<li><code>while (phase &gt;= twopi) { phase -= twopi; }</code> - This should not be a loop. It can be done in O(1), something like <code>phase = fmod(phase, twopi)</code> - but double-check this. For very small values of <code>phase</code>, <code>fmod</code> may actually be slower. You can also try <code>phase -= twopi*int(phase/twopi)</code> which is also O(1).</li>
<li>On this line:</li>
</ul>

<p><code>double *pModVoiceValues = &amp;pModValues[voiceIndex * bufferSize];</code></p>

<p>You're dereferencing and then re-referencing a pointer, which you don't need to do. Simply add:</p>

<p><code>double *pModVoiceValues = pModValues + voiceIndex*bufferSize;</code></p>

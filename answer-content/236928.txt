<p>In terms of playing the game, what is the use of the returned value?</p>

<p>For instance, <code>A222</code> would have the value 17, and at that value, most people would stick and not ask for another card.  But if it could be counted as 7, everyone <em>would</em> ask for another card.</p>

<p>To be useful, the result will need to be a list of possible values, <code>(7,17)</code> for this example.</p>

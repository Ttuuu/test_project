<p>The solution is inefficient. </p>

<p>First of all, there is absolutely no need to calculate the set of characters in advance. you can iterate over the sentence and build the map during this iteration. you don't need to know the keys in advance. </p>

<p>Furthermore, for each distinct character, you iterate over the entire sentence. there is really no need for this Cartesian-type processing. the map can be calculated with just one iteration over the sentence. This is providing you can parse the words without the need for <code>split()</code></p>

<p>while we are in this subject, split by whitespace will leave the words with punctuation marks, so you would get "kota," in the output, not to mention your example sentence contains two occurrences of "kota" that will appear in the output, so you need to decide if that's what you want.</p>

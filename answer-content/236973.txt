<p>You say: <em>"This code works, but I'm sure it's far from optimal. I'd like any and all recommendations."</em> AND <em>"And I know better algorithms exist, but I wanted to keep it simple."</em> </p>

<p>Unfortunately, these two are very hard to combine. If you want a piece of code to be efficient, a good algorithm is always the most important thing.</p>

<p>In general, my advice is to avoid doing logic in Bash. It is VERY clunky and it's extremely easy to make small mistakes that show up when you least expect it, and it can be years from now. I only use Bash for extremely simple logic. Basically, I treat it as a way of avoiding having to type commands manually in the command prompt. If you would not use the command prompt for a single instance of your problem, then Bash is probably the wrong language. </p>

<p>Your particular example is a case where I would use Python instead.</p>

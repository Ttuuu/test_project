<p>A more pythonic method for that last <code>for</code> loop would be to use nested list comprehensions.  It's likely faster, as well:</p>
<pre><code>[item for sublist in [[x.real, x.imag] for x in answer] for item in sublist]
</code></pre>
<p>See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/952914/how-to-make-a-flat-list-out-of-list-of-lists">this question</a> for details about what's happening here, if you're not already familiar with list comprehensions.</p>
<p>In other words, instead of these four lines:</p>
<pre><code>export[q-1, 0] = q
for _ in range(len(answer)):
      export[q-1, 2*_+1] = answer[_].real
      export[q-1, 2*(_+1)] = answer[_].imag
</code></pre>
<p>You could write this:</p>
<pre><code>line = [q]
line.extend([item for sublist in [[x.real, x.imag] for x in answer] for item in sublist])
export[q-1] = line
</code></pre>
    </div>

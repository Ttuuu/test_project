  <p>I see that I have too many ArrayLists and Arrays here and there throughout the code, maybe that can be replaced to begin with.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, that would probably be a good idea. In <code>findDigits</code> you internally use an <code>ArrayList</code>, I'm guessing because it's a lot easier to use than an array (which is true, a <code>List</code> is the correct collection type here). But then you transform it to an array, which isn't really needed. </p>

<p>Returning lists instead of arrays is perfectly acceptable in Java, and is in fact used in most cases (an exception might be made for fixed length arrays in performance critical code, eg coordinates).</p>

<p>So just change your signature from <code>Long[] findDigits(long num)</code> to <code>List&lt;Long&gt; findDigits(long num)</code>, and then use a <code>List</code> in <code>findCount</code> as well.</p>

<p><strong>Misc</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>declare variables in as small a scope as possible. <code>sc</code> isn't really needed anywhere except in <code>main</code>, so declare it there.</li>
<li>don't use short variables names. <code>sc</code> would be clearer as <code>scanner</code> and <code>al</code> could be <code>results</code>.</li>
<li><code>findDigits</code> could be <code>getDigits</code>, after all you are not really searching for the digits or computing them (they are right there), just getting them.</li>
<li><code>findCount</code> could be <code>countDivisors</code>, and then <code>num</code> could be <code>divisor</code>.</li>
<li>the question says that you are given an integer, but you use <code>long</code> instead.</li>
<li>your while loop in <code>findDigits</code> could be simplified to <code>digits.add(num % 10);  num = num / 10;</code>.</li>
</ul>

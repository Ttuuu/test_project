<p>I'll try and address @Sam's second point since I agree with him. How you have it now is an incredible amount of work and is unsustainable. Lets break it down. Look at these chunks of code:</p>

<pre><code>if '2sp' in playerHand:
    playerHandValue = playerHandValue + 2
if '3sp' in playerHand:
    playerHandValue = playerHandValue + 3
if '4sp' in playerHand:
    playerHandValue = playerHandValue + 4

. . .

if '2sp' in dealerHand:
    dealerHandValue = dealerHandValue + 2
if '3sp' in dealerHand:
    dealerHandValue = dealerHandValue + 3
if '4sp' in dealerHand:
    dealerHandValue = dealerHandValue + 4
</code></pre>

<p>There's multiple problems with this setup:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Really, the suit of the card doesn't matter. You only actually care about the value of the card.</p></li>
<li><p>Those two discrete chunks are nearly identical. The only difference between them is the first takes the player's hand and returns the player's total, and the second takes the dealer's hand and returns the dealer's total.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Lets deal with the first point, then expand it to fix the second.</p>

<p>Whenever you have <em>nearly</em> exactly the same code repeated over and over, you probably want to use a function and/or loop to reduce the duplication. I'd start with a function that takes a card and returns its value:</p>

<pre><code># This could be simplified since all values are the same
face_values = {"K": 10, "Q": 10, "J": 10}

def card_value(card):
    raw_value = card[:-2]  # Chop off the suit

    if raw_value in face_values:
        return face_values[raw_value]

    else:
        return int(raw_value)

&gt;&gt;&gt; card_value("Ksp")
10

&gt;&gt;&gt; card_value("8he")
8
</code></pre>

<p>Then, just loop:</p>

<pre><code>player_hand_value = 0
for card in player_hand:
    player_hand_value += card_value(card)
</code></pre>

<p>There's still the problem though that you'd need to duplicate this code for the dealer. The solution is to make a function:</p>

<pre><code>def hand_value(hand):
    total = 0
    for card in hand:
        total += card_value(card)

    return total

&gt;&gt; hand_value(["Ksp", "2he"])
12
</code></pre>

<p>Then just use that function:</p>

<pre><code>def find_hand_value():
    global player_hand
    global player_hand_value

    playerHandValue = hand_value(player_hand)

    . . .
</code></pre>

<p>Then, to clean it up further:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>revealDealerHand</code> is also mostly the same as the player version. They could be generalized further by creating a function that handles the identical bits.</p></li>
<li><p>You'd probably want to represent cards using a cleaner method. Even a tuple of <code>("K", "Spade")</code> would be better than what you have now. Needing to parse a string to gets its value as needed isn't very clean</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I would first start by doing some basic profiling of your application to see where the issues are. This could be as simple as inserting <code>console.log( (new Date()).valueOf() )</code> in a few places.</p>

<p>Some things I noticed.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Is your dictionary file sorted? If not then sort it first. Either way use <code>bsearch</code> to locate entries rather han using <code>&amp;</code> which is very naive.</p></li>
<li><p>It looks like you are trying every combination of letters but you probably want to use an algorithm that stops if there is no match. For example given <code>668</code>, if your dictionary contains no entries starting with <code>mn</code> (66) then there is no point in checking <code>mnt</code>, <code>mnu</code>, mnv` or any of the longer combinations.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to reduce the number of times you copy and modify arrays (<code>[a..b]</code> or <code>shift</code>)</p></li>
<li><p>This check: <code>next if first_array.length &lt; 3 || second_array.length &lt; 3</code> could go before you copy the array (in a slightly modified form). You could just change <code>for i in (2..total_number)</code> to <code>for i in (4..total_number-2)</code></p></li>
</ul>

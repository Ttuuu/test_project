<p>The factorial function looks more complicated than it should be. You are starting by multiplying by 1, which is not all that useful. You can also use the fact that the range where the start is beyond the end is empty to your advantage. Last but not least, you are returning two different things. One is some formatted string, the other being an integer.</p>

<p>By correcting this, you would get something like this:</p>

<pre><code>def processor(n):
    """Finding the factorial of a given number. """
    if n == 0:
        product = 1
    else:
        product = n

    for i in range(2, n):
        product *= i

    return str(n) + '! = ' + str(product)
</code></pre>
    </div>

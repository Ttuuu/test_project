<p>The minor problem is that you are printing the result in the wrong place.</p>

<p>The major problem is that <code>n</code> may be up to 100,000.  This means you need to run 10,000,000,000 of your inner test.  And you may have only 0.02 seconds to do that.</p>

<p>The trick to dealing with that is probably to determine the maximum possible score of a given <code>i</code> and <code>l[i]</code>, and skip the inner loop if it isn't worth it.  As part of this, you might find it beneficial to determine the range of the <code>l[]</code> values.</p>

<p>As an example, if you determine that all <code>l[i]&lt;=5</code>, then it isn't worth looking at <code>i&gt;6</code> and <code>i&lt;n-6</code> (or thereabouts... I'm not positive about the border condition).</p>

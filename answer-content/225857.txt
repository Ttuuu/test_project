<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>All looks good as a start, I would advise on sticking the footer to the bottom of the page using the following piece of css.</p>

<pre><code>position: fixed;
bottom: 0;
</code></pre>

<p>This will affect the positioning of the text but that can be remedied by setting the position to fixed on the right div to realign it to the right of the page.</p>
    </div>

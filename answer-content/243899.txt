<p>If these die rolls are going to be used for anything at all important, it's better to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>secrets</code></a> module rather than <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>random</code></a>.</p>
<pre><code>import secrets

...

rng = secrets.SystemRandom()

...

    result = rng.randint(1, 6)
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>random</code> module provides numbers which are statistically random, but not cryptographically secure; in principle (and if there's enough money involved, also in practice), someone could work out what the next number is likely to be.</p>

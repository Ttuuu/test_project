<p>I'm not going to pay attention to your algorithm, as Arnav is right there, but instead focus on style problems. It should be a giant red flag when you <strong>raise a <code>ZeroDivisionError</code> when you aren't dividing by zero</strong>. The correct solution here is to put your code inside a function, which will let you return the correct result. While here, you might as well make the upper limit of your range <code>n*n</code> instead of <code>1,000,000</code>, which will let it work for bigger values. Also, I know I said I wouldn't focus on the algorithm, but you can make the inner loop be <code>while k*k&lt;i</code>, as any prime factor of <code>n</code> will be less than the <code>n**.5</code>. This simple change makes your code take .1 second instead of 30.</p>

<pre><code>def nth_prime(n):
    counter = 2
    for i in range(3, n**2, 2):
        k = 1
        while k*k &lt; i:
            k += 2
            if i % k == 0:
               break
        else:
            counter += 1
        if counter == n:
            return i

print(nth_prime(100001))

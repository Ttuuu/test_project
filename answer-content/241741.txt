<p>As Maarten and Torben already pointed out, creating a user id that way is a terrible idea. I'd like to go one step further and add, that <strong>creating</strong> a userId as a primary key technical identifier for a table is generally a terrible idea.</p>

<p>Leave this to the database. About every database out there offers you the possibility to declare the column as some kind of auto value, may it be random ids, incrementing values or whichever solution. Don't do this in code <strong>at all</strong>. Save the object, read back the modified object, and <em>magic</em> it suddenly has an id.</p>

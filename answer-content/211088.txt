<p>"This isn't exactly DRY" is pretty much what I think about</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>$(this).text().trim() == '&amp;nbsp;' || $(this).text().trim() === ''
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p><code>text()</code> can be a very expensive call: I would refactor to only do <code>$(this).text().trim()</code> once.</p>

<hr>

<p>As a minor concern, the use of <code>trim()</code> suggests that you want to remove nodes whose text is purely whitespace. So shouldn't a node whose text is <code>&amp;nsbp; &amp;nbsp;</code> be removed? Perhaps you should be using a regex match instead of <code>trim()</code>? Something like (warning: untested) <code>$(this).text().match(/^(\s|&amp;nbsp;)*$/)</code>.</p>

<p>And then you could take it further: <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> isn't the only way of escaping <code>U+00a0</code>, and the other whitespace characters can also be escaped in various ways...</p>

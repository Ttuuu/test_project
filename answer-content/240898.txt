<p>Avoiding nested if-else blocks would improve the code readability considerably , Instead of having the core logic inside the main I would delegate that to a function with multiple short functions for every rule which would return a boolean value . </p>

<p>So instead of </p>

<pre><code>if(condition1){

   if(condition2){

       if(condition3){



    }

  }

}
</code></pre>

<p>I would prefer to have </p>

<pre><code>if(!condition1){

//fail here   

}

if(!condition2){

//fail here   

}

if(!condition3){

//fail here   

}

<span class="math-container">```</span>
</code></pre>

<p>I don't think your code is correct.</p>

<p><code>select top 1</code>, without any kind of <code>order by</code> clause selects an essentially random record from a table, so unless you know that there can be only one event with the right <code>EventTypeId</code> you may be missing event combinations that are relevant.</p>

<p>If I understand the problem correctly, I think you need something more like this:</p>

<pre><code>select A.BusinessObjectId from
( select BusinessObjectId, min(DateEvent) as min, max(DateEvent) as max 
  from CustomEvent where EventTypeId = 11
  group by BusinessObjectId 
) as A
inner join 
( select BusinessObjectId, min(DateEvent) as min, max(DateEvent) as max 
  from CustomEvent where EventTypeId = 10
  group by BusinessObjectId 
) as B on A.BusinessObjectId = B.BusinessObjectId
where datediff( second, A.min, B.max ) &gt; 1 or datediff( second, B.min, A.max ) &gt; 1
group by A.BusinessObjectId
</code></pre>

<p>I have not included the six month restriction.</p>

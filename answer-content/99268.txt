<p>You could save some computation by first transforming your collection of universities to have the coordinates, spherical polars, that are used in the distance calculation; at present if you have n universities you will do these conversions n squared times.</p>

<p>Along the same lines you could change the distance formula you use by expanding cos(theta1-theta2); then your formula for 'cos' would involve only sines and cosines of phi1,theta1,phi2,theta2. So if you were to store these in the transformed table, the calculation of distance would involve a few multiplies and adds to compute 'cos', and then an acos call.</p>

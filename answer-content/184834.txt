<p>Don't write the type into the variable name. The type should be able to change without the variable having to be renamed. <code>subfolders</code> already tells you that it is a collection of subfolders. <code>subfolder_names</code> might be better, to make clear that it contains the folders' names, not wrapper objects for the file system.</p>

<p>Removing the backslash from the beginning can prevent you from having to read up the code to make sure where the backslash is, at the beginning or the end. <code>subfolder</code> or <code>subfolder_name</code> implies just the name. So add the backslash wherever you concatenate the strings.</p>

<hr>

<pre><code>#Delete all records in the table
db_exec = conn.execute('delete from records')
</code></pre>

<p>That comment is obsolete, as it adds no information that is not already in the next line of code.</p>

<hr>

<pre><code>#Loop through the list of subfolders
for i in subfolder_list:
    #loop through the files in the subfolder
    for filename in os.listdir(folder + i):
        #insert the file names into the table
        db_exec = conn.execute('insert into records (file_name) values (' + filename + '\')')
</code></pre>

<p>Again, the comments are not needed, and instead impair readability. Instead of explaining with comments what the code does, improve the code to better explain itself. <code>i</code> can be acceptable as a loop variable, but whenever possible, use a more explicit name, like in this case <code>subfolder_name</code>. Then you get this more expressive code:</p>

<pre><code>for subfolder_name in subfolder_names:
    for file_name in os.listdir(folder + r'\' + subfolder_name)
        db_exec = conn.execute('insert into records (file_name) values (' + file_name + '\')')
</code></pre>

<hr>

<pre><code>#Commit the insert statements
db_exec = conn.execute('commit')
</code></pre>

<p>Again the comment is not needed.</p>

<hr>

<pre><code>print "Complete."
</code></pre>

<p>What is complete? Give the user more info, e. g. `"42 file names inserted into database."</p>

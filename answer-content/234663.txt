<p>Disclaimer: I'm not the super duper python crack.</p>

<p>When discussing such questions I usually like to figure out first, what's the thing we're optimizing for.
If it's performance you might make other decisions than when its maintainability or readability.</p>

<p>For readability all of them are fine and have small benefits or disadvantages.
In the end the style wins you're most used to. However, there might be technical dis/advantages which I'm not aware of.</p>

<p>Option 1 has in favor that the call is a bit more explicit about what its doing, because there is one important argument explicitly added (spreadsheetId) and a number of arguments with less importance.</p>

<p>If you scroll over the code, 1 has a small advantage there I'd say.</p>

<p>I don't exactly get, what you mean by </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since it's almost impossible to search for **{ in codebases,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But my gut says, if you need to search something as a string other than a name, there is something odd, which needs to be fixed.</p>

<p>Maybe your parameters have a degree of complexity where it would make sense to add functions which create them (and also document their intention through their name).</p>

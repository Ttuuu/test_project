<p>I would store the value to write directly in the <code>Instruction</code>. That way you don't need the if-else in <code>ExecuteInstruction</code>. Instead it's just an assignment.</p>

<pre><code>this.tape[currentIndex] = inst.ValueToWrite;
</code></pre>

<p>I would also store the <code>NextCard</code> value directly. This requires <code>ControlCard</code> to be a reference type but that's already the case. You do need to pass which state is the final state.</p>

<p>It is very likely that the tape would need to grow. If the tape can't grow then you technically don't have a turing machine.</p>

<p>Also it may be handy to be able to initialize the state of the tape before starting.</p>

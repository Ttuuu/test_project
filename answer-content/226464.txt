<p>Assume you are referring to speed, not conciseness when asking about efficiency. In which case reducing the amount of loops will not necessarily improve performance.</p>

<pre><code>"type": next((data_type["type"] for data_type in DATA_TYPES if data_type["name"] == data_type_attr_name))
</code></pre>

<p>This can be improved so that you are not needing to go over <code>DATA_TYPES</code> looking for a matching name to <code>data_type_attr_name</code> every iteration. Instead you can make a reverse lookup dictionary once before the loop where <code>data_type["name"]</code> is the key.  </p>

<p>Whenever you are searching through a list often, it can be very beneficial to create a dictionary.</p>

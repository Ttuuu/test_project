<h3>Separate the code in short and simple functions</h3>

<p>Your current functions are way too long: for example, <code>main()</code> has 1282 lines. That's much more than acceptable.</p>

<p>While the exact maximal number of lines is a subjective thing, there are some good rules of thumb. For example, this <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/q/133404/139851">question</a> mentions 100 to 200 lines as the upper bound. Ideally, every function should do just one thing and do it well - this called SRP, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle" rel="nofollow noreferrer">single responsibility principle</a>.</p>

<p>In many programs <code>main()</code> is somewhat an exception of this, as it usually does both initialization (by calling an <code>init()</code> or similar function) and the main loop. Still, the main loop should consist mainly of calls to other functions and/or state machine logic. I believe the other answers give more details on structuring it.</p>

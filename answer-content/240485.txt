<p>Miguel has made some excellent points; I won’t repeat those.  Here are some more comments / suggestions:</p>

<hr>

<p>The <code>type</code> field is effectively public, because you have <code>public void setType(String type)</code>, yet it is clear that this field should not be settable externally.  It shouldn’t exist at all, since we can simply ask:</p>

<pre><code>if (person instanceof Student) {…}
</code></pre>

<p>instead of needing to check a string to see if it is equal to <code>"student"</code> (or was that "Student"?  Or maybe it was <code>"STUDENT"</code>???  Maybe you should be using named constants ... or better ... an <code>enum</code>!)</p>

<hr>

<p><code>age</code> is a horrible field.  As time goes by, it changes.  If you have multiple people in a database, you are constantly updating the records.  Store their birthdate, and compute their age.</p>

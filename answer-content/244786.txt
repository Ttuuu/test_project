<blockquote>
<p>If not a fan of using a for loop to echo each value in a list to 'return' a list. Is there a cleaner way to do this?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>printf</code> command will reuse the format string to consume all the input:</p>
<pre><code>printf "%s\n" $mounts
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm not a fan of names like $argv[1] rather than $uuid as they make the code harder to understand. Is there a clean way to specify these?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Use the <a href="https://fishshell.com/docs/current/cmds/function.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>-a</code> option to <code>function</code></a></p>
<pre><code>function load_passwords -a uuid -a mountpath
    set mounts (pdev $uuid)
    ...
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>The code feels unreadable, it's why I've written such a thorough description here. I can see myself forgetting all this nuance and coming back to this in a year and go, which idiot wrote this?! ðŸ˜¡</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sorry, can't help with that. Looks reasonable to me. If you're worried about
forgetting the nuance, add some comments including the URL for this
question.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm not a fan of having all the functions be public, pmount should probably be private.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why? There's no sensitive info in it.</p>
<p>The only way you can achieve privacy is to chmod the source files so no
other user can read them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm not a fan of needing sudo when I have access to /path/to/mountpoint. There's a certain irony to needing to enter two passwords to get one...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Assuming you have the permission to do so, you could visudo so that your
user does not need to enter a password for <code>sudo mount</code> and <code>sudo umount</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I feel the code is just kinda messy and not great.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's pretty much the nature of the beast with shell scripting. At least
fish has cleaner (if perhaps more verbose) syntax than bash.</p>
<hr>
<p>I'm a Lastpass user, and have made similar efforts to access passwords via the lpass command line tool.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.console?redirectedfrom=MSDN&amp;view=netframework-4.8" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Console</a> uses synchronization:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I/O operations that use these streams are synchronized, which means that multiple threads can read from, or write to, the streams.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This synchronization ensures that all sentences are printed and nothing gets lost due to a data race.</p>

<p>However, synchronization kills multithreading, because the threads will stop at the synchronization object. Don't use <code>Console.WriteLine()</code> for performance comparisons.</p>

<p>Another thing to consider: at the moment you have 3 tasks, each printing 1000 lines. That way, scheduling cannot be done in small pieces. What you typically want is 3000 tasks, each printing 1 line. (read "printing" == "doing work").</p>

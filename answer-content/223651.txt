<p>To truncate a double to 3 decimal places and remove the decimal separator, is I think more easily done by multiplying by 1000 and casting to an int.  Padding the result to 9 digits is easily done with a format specifier in the ToString method.  It could look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>static string FormatNum(double num) =&gt; ((int)(num * 1000)).ToString("D9");
</code></pre>

<p>Note I've also put it in a method with an expression body.</p>

<p>I just noticed that you wanted the padding with spaces not zeros here's a version that does that:</p>

<pre><code>static string FormatNum(double num) =&gt; string.Format("{0,9:D}",((int)(num * 1000)));
</code></pre>

<p>As was pointed out, your solution produced a rounded off number.  If that is required here's one way:</p>

<pre><code>static string FormatNum(double num) =&gt; string.Format("{0,9:D}",((int)(Math.Round(num * 1000))));
</code></pre>

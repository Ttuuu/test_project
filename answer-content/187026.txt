<p>FWIW, this might be a rare case where the <code>Mid</code> statement is apropos here. This doesn't require any API. This should yield similar performance characteristics since we only allocate the buffer once just as we do with the API version.</p>

<pre><code>Public Function Replicate(RepeatString As String, NumOfTimes As Long)
    Dim s As String
    Dim c As Long
    Dim l As Long
    Dim i As Long

    l = Len(RepeatString)
    c = l * NumOfTimes
    s = Space$(c)

    For i = 1 To c Step l
        Mid(s, i, l) = RepeatString
    Next

    Replicate = s
End Function

<p>The <code>newArr</code> local variable is unnecessary to declare and initialize,
and this is a confusing statement:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>return newArr = concatArr.filter(...);
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Eliminate the <code>newArr</code> variable, you don't need it.
And avoid assigning to values in a return statement.</p>

<hr>

<p><code>concatArr</code> is a waste: it stores the content of both input arrays,
only to filter out elements later.</p>

<p>The filtering logic is also inefficient: for each value in the concatenated array,
it checks if the value is present in both input arrays. But every value is present in at least one of the arrays, so one of the checks is evaluated unnecessarily.</p>

<p>It would be better to reorganize the operations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Apply filter on the first array</li>
<li>Apply filter on the second array</li>
<li>Concatenate the results of the filters</li>
</ul>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>function diffArray(arr1, arr2) {
  const diff = (arr1, arr2) =&gt; arr1.filter(x =&gt; arr2.indexOf(x) === -1);
  return diff(arr1, arr2).concat(diff(arr2, arr1));
}
</code></pre>

<p>Congratulations on writing a tk program.  They can be hard.</p>

<p>Moving code out of the top level is an improvement you can in any program.  Top level code creates global variables, makes it unclear what might be used below, and so on.  You could just do this:</p>

<pre><code>def main():
    # Sets background color to black
    root.configure(bg="black")
    ...
        except tk.TclError:
            pass

main()
</code></pre>

<p>It may seem minor, but it makes it easier to see that <code>root</code>, <code>time_display</code> and others are global, but that <code>author</code> is not.</p>

<p>One fix at a time.    Keep hacking!  Keep notes.</p>

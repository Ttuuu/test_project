<h2>When using inheritance, always answer the 'Sub <code>is a</code> Super?'</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would it be okay to make these children of a BlackjackPerson class,
  since some of the behavior should be the same? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>or </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Look for common functionality</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a thing that often goes wrong. Just because there is a bit of similar behavior does not necessarily mean there is a 'is-a' relation.</p>

<p>For example, both a Human and a Car can <code>moveForward()</code>. Does this mean a Human is a Car or a Car is a Human. Surely not :) </p>

<p>Let's think about the common behaviour of a BlackJackPlayer and a BlackJackDealer. It is <code>displayHand()</code>. Can a <code>BlackJackDealer</code> be seen as a <code>BlackJackPlayer</code>? I would say yes, it <strong>is a</strong> special kind of player which have some specialized behavior. So I think, in your case, it would be fine to have </p>

<pre><code>BlackJackDealer extends BlackJackPlayer 
</code></pre>

<p>No need for abstract supertypes.</p>

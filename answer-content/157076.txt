<p>In addition to <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/157075/95296">rolfl's answer</a> about the implementation itself, let's look at the signature of the method:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>public Boolean getIdentitySummation(BigInteger identities)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This declares a method taking a <code>BigInteger</code> and returning a <code>Boolean</code>. This raises comments:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can the South African ID truly be considered an integer, or is it really a more of a <code>String</code> that happens to only be made of digits? This thing probably cannot really change so it should be fine for South Africa, but some countries, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_identification_number#Spain" rel="nofollow noreferrer">like Spain</a>, have characters in it, which you wouldn't be able to represent with a <code>BigInteger</code>. Note that the rest of the method treats it like a <code>String</code> anyway, so perhaps taking a <code>String</code> to begin with is simpler, both for the method and the code using it.</li>
<li>Returning <code>Boolean</code> says that <code>null</code> could be a valid outcome. And what would it mean for this method to return <code>null</code>? In fact, the implementation never returns that. While you could document in Javadoc, and say that <code>null</code> will never be returned, prefer to force it in the code by returning a <code>boolean</code>. This saves the headache of the caller trying to determine if they really should check for <code>null</code> (because the documentation may be out of date, or because they're just paranoid).</li>
<li>The method is named <code>getIdentitySummation</code>, which implies that it returns some sort of identity summation. But it is not the case, it checks the validity of the given identification number, and returns whether it is valid or not. Sure, the process of doing that requires checking the digits by performing a summation, but the caller doesn't need to know; they just want to know whether the ID is valid or not.</li>
</ul>

<p>With all this, I find a better signature would be</p>

<pre><code>public boolean isIdentificationValid(String identification)
</code></pre>

<p>I think the general algorithm is OK, but you have a lot of repetition in your code! Also avoid writing out the alphabet by hand when you could have Python generate it for you. Here is the code without repetition:</p>
<pre><code>n = int(input('Enter a size: '))

alpha = [chr(ord('a') + i) for i in range(0, 26)]

for k in range(1 - n, n):
    j = n - abs(k)   
    center = '-'.join(alpha[n-1:n-j:-1] + alpha[n-j:n])
    padding = '-' * abs(k) * 2
    print(padding + center + padding)
</code></pre>
<p>I used a single for-loop that goes from <code>1-n</code> to <code>n</code>, so this covers both the upper and lower half, and I also made it so you don't have to treat the center line as a special case.</p>

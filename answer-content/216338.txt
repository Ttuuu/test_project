<p>This is a small answer but is kind of important in my opinion. <code>bool InList(T data)</code> and <code>int ListSize()</code> are existing patterns among .Net classes, they should be named <code>Contains</code> and <code>Count</code>. The lesson to come out of this is that you should try to reuse common names when the pattern fits.</p>

<p>Also, your class name shouldn't be pluralized. <code>SinglyLinkedLists</code> -&gt; <code>SinglyLinkedList</code></p>

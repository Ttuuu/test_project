<p>You don't need to have implementations consisting of just single line.
For example, you can replace the <code>Listener2</code> direclty with a lambda as :</p>

<pre><code>buttClear = new JButton("AC");
buttClear.addActionListener(event -&gt;  input.setText(""));
</code></pre>

<p>Same goes will all one liner <code>Listener</code>s in your code.</p>

<p>There's also a bug in your code because of the way you are extracting numbers from the input field.<br>
If you perform <code>4/3</code>, you will get the result as <code>1.3333333</code>, and if you continue doing more operations like <code>1.333333*3</code>, your calculator returns the result as <code>0.0</code>.</p>

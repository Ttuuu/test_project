<p>Hi Jim Diroff II and welcome to CodeReview,</p>

<p>Your code looks sane and I didn't spot any leaks.</p>

<p>In <code>printlist()</code> why are you using a double pointer? This is only required if you intend to modify the pointer value, which you don't. Better use a normal pointer here:</p>

<pre><code>void printlist(NODE *head)
{
    NODE *tracer = head;
    while (tracer != NULL)
    {
        printf("%i\n", tracer-&gt;value);
        tracer = tracer-&gt;next;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you move the definitions of your helper functions above <code>main()</code>, you can save yourself the forward declarations. </p>

<p>To get <code>freelist()</code> to work in the opposite direction, I suggest making it a doubly linked list, which also would be a nice additional task to learn more about pointers. Having a recursive cleanup function has the potential to trash your programm with longer lists and will also add a lot performance overhead:</p>

<pre><code>void freelist(NODE* head)
{
    if (head)
    {
         freelist(head-&gt;next);
         free(head);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also, don't avoid error handling. It's the biggest issue I see in code, that someone didn't want to check <em>that one return value</em>.</p>

<p>The code is well commented. The indentation in most places seems to be four spaces but the last few lines have indentation of two spaces so that could be made more consistent. The last comment is a bit humorous...</p>

<p>It seems that if the button isn't found by the id attribute, it just bails. There could be alternative ways to find that button. For example, my company recently upgraded to version 7.11.2 and it appears that the create button still has an id attribute of <code>create_link</code> but the list item above it also has an id attribute of <code>create-menu</code> so that element could be found instead. And the unordered list also has a class name of <code>aui-nav</code> so if the create button can't be found the list could be found instead.  I also see in the latest online version 1001.0.0 (e.g. *.atlassian.net) that the navigation menu has been moved to the left side of the screen and no longer uses list items so if your Jira gets updated you'll need to update your approach to finding that element.</p>

<p>I know you are familiar with <code>const</code> given your answers <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/149644/120114">like this one</a> so why not use it for things like <code>projectCode</code>, <code>idat</code>?</p>

<p>Also, a list item element is created and then the innerHTML contains another list item element:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>var node = document.createElement("LI");
node.innerHTML = '&lt;li style="padding-left: 20px; text-decoration: underline; cursor: pointer;"&gt;&lt;div id="idat"&gt;Log activity&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;';
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This yields HTML like below:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>&lt;li&gt;&lt;li style="padding-left: 20px; text-decoration: underline; cursor: pointer;"&gt;&lt;div id="idat"&gt;Log activity&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

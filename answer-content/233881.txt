<p>Welcome to Code Review.  Not too bad but I would suggest a few things.</p>

<p><code>_failureCount</code> is only used in <code>ExecuteAction</code> so I would only define it locally to <code>ExecuteAction</code> and renamed it simply <code>failureCount</code>.</p>

<p>You may want to expose threshold publicly as a property since different instances could have differing thresholds.  Suggest:</p>

<pre><code>public int Threshold { get; }
</code></pre>

<p>Consider having a <code>ToString()</code> override.</p>

<p><code>CircuitState</code> enum is okay where its at, but if it were me, I usually define it external to the class.  </p>

<p>You may consider having the <code>State</code> be gettable publicly.  Suggest:</p>

<pre><code>public CircuitState State { get; private set; }
</code></pre>

<p>I see no reason for <code>Invoke()</code>.  Just call <code>ExecuteAction(_currentAction)</code> directly.</p>

<p>The constructor has a <code>timeout</code> parameter.  I would encourage clarity in the name with <code>millisecondsTimeout</code>.</p>

<p>And finally, the biggest issue I see is that you really should get into the practice of use <code>{ }</code> with <code>if</code>.  I know C++ was okay with this, and C# allows it, but here at CR we strongly discourage it because it could lead to nefarious hard-to-find bugs. There are lots of places where you would change this; here is but one example:</p>

<pre><code>if (State != CircuitState.Open)
{
    ChangeState(CircuitState.Open);
}
</code></pre>
    </div>

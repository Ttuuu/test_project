<p>If <code>y</code> will always be a sine wave, then you're going about this the wrong way. Rather than calculating <code>trigger_marker</code> based on whether <code>y</code> exceeds <code>tr</code>, you should be calling <code>asin(tr)</code> to see where in the cycle the trigger will be crossed. You would then avoid the need for most of your lists and loops.</p>

<p>I would suggest renaming your methods. <code>method1</code>, and <code>method2_itr</code> would be better if they were instead named what they did. Currently, these functions have comments above them explaining their functionality, instead of that, let the function name speak for the function itself. Also, the argument <code>wd</code> passed into method2_itr, it would be better if the argument actually described it. For an outside observer on first glance it's difficult to see what <code>wd</code> stands for.</p>

<p>As Robert Martin famously says  "The code itself is the best comment"</p>

<p>It's important to remember this as you're writing code, instead of every function needing to be commented, many functions should be able to speak for themselves.</p>

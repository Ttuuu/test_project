<h1>Proper integer conversion</h1>

<p>Right now, as it stands, you're just converting any user input to a integer, using the <code>int</code> function. What do you suppose happens if the user enters something like <code>"abc"</code>?</p>

<p>What you need to do is set up a <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/errors.html#handling-exceptions"><code>try</code>-<code>except</code></a> block, like this:</p>

<pre><code>try:
    user_integer = input("Enter an integer: ")
    user_integer = int(user_integer)
except ValueError:
    print("You must enter a valid integer!")
</code></pre>

<p>To set up something like this in your code, you'd change your code to something like this:</p>

<pre><code>...

while True:
    print("Guess a number between 1 and 100.")
    guess = input()

    try:
        integer_guess = int(guess):

        ...
    except ValueError:
        ...
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h1>Tracking the number of "rounds"/"tries"</h1>

<p>Rather than printing a message saying that if the user got below a certain amount of tries, they win, you can implement it into the code. The easiest way to do this would be to use a <code>for ... in range( ... )</code> loop, like this:</p>

<pre><code>rounds = ...
for _ in range(rounds):
    ...
</code></pre>

<p><em>(This has been implemented below, for reference.)</em></p>

<hr>

<h1>Design</h1>

<p>This is not a very extensible design, again, I'd recommend creating a function that allows you to create custom games, like this:</p>

<pre><code>def number_guessing_game(low, high, rounds):
    print("Guess a number between {low} and {high}. You have {rounds} rounds to try and guess correctly.".format(low=low, high=high, rounds=rounds))
    number = random.randint(low, high)

    for _ in range(rounds):
        guess = input("Enter an integer: ")

        try:
            integer = int(guess)
            if integer == number:
                print('You won!!!')
                return
            elif integer &lt; number:
                print('Try Higher')
            elif integer &gt; number:
                print('Try Lower')

        except ValueError:
            print("You must enter a valid integer.")

    print("You didn't guess correctly in {rounds} rounds. You lost.".format(rounds=rounds))
</code></pre>

<p>An example function call might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>number_guessing_game(1, 100, 6)
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>In short, all of your code becomes the following:</p>

<pre><code>import random

def number_guessing_game(low, high, rounds):
    print("Guess a number between {low} and {high}. You have {rounds} rounds to try and guess correctly.".format(low=low, high=high, rounds=rounds))
    number = random.randint(low, high)

    for _ in range(rounds):
        guess = input("Enter an integer: ")

        try:
            integer = int(guess)
            if integer == number:
                print('You won!!!')
                return
            elif integer &lt; number:
                print('Try Higher')
            elif integer &gt; number:
                print('Try Lower')

        except ValueError:
            print("You must enter a valid integer.")

    print("You didn't guess correctly in {rounds} rounds. You lost.".format(rounds=rounds))

number_guessing_game(1, 100, 6)
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

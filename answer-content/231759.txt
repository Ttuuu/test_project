<p>Searching that way is futile, the number of candidate solutions grows exponentially with the number of characters, I would ballpark over 10^20 candidate solutions for 13 characters (an average of (95^13 / (95 * 13)) = 4.15x10^22 but it strongly depends on the value of hashval). The solutions of the equation  a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n = x  form an hyperplane of dimension n - 1.</p>

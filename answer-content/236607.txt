<p>It seems that the order of elements in <code>outlines</code> is not important, so it could also be of type <code>std::unordered_set&lt;line&gt;</code>. Of course, we'd then have to give it a suitable hash function, but that's easy to do.</p>

<p>Another consideration: for the 2nd loop of <code>vertex_of</code>, we are essentially interested in the question "given a line, is there another line whose end matches the beginning of the first?". For this, we could set up a data structure that orders lines based on their beginning. By doing that, we could do away with much less work than your current quadratic solution.</p>

<p>If I look at your code, it looks like you are programming in 98. C++ has evolved a lot, C++11 is the least to accept, C++17 should be the standard for this time.</p>

<p><code>getProductName</code> could/should be a const method. Most likely, others can as well.</p>

<p>Looking at the <code>PC_Towers</code> class, I would expect it to be a <code>final</code> class.</p>

<p>I'm not in favor of the <code>setAttributes</code>, it doesn't belong in this class. Do you intend to add as well the logic to read it from file, database, json, XML ... to it? Best to separate it and use a kind of factory pattern.
Looking closer: <code>while (cond) { ... break; }</code> looks a lot like an if-statement. How about using it to have less confusion?</p>

<p>From a class design, why would you create the same string for every instance. You could make it a static or simply inline it in your function call.</p>

<p>Looks like you are using a factory, let's use some abstractions here. Though, ignoring those, you duplicated the strings. One small typo, big consequences.</p>

<p>Looking at the factory, it still does naked new. Use <code>std::make_unique</code> as it prevents memory leaks you have in your program.</p>

<p><code>desplayAllProducts</code> (typo?) looks like it can benefit from a range based for-loop. Oh, and don't use <code>.at</code> on a vector if you always know you index within bounds.</p>

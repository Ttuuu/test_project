<p>Like knut suggested, a simple solution would be to sort the meetings by start time and for each check if it conflicts with the next.</p>

<p>E.g. given a list of meetings:</p>

<pre><code>conflict = meetings.sort_by(&amp;:start_time).each_cons(2).any? do |a, b|
  a.end_time &gt; b.start_time
end
</code></pre>

<p>No need to model a conference room, or raise exceptions; <code>conflict</code> will indicate if the meetings overlap or not.</p>

<p>If the question involved a list of pre-scheduled meetings, and having to check if a new meeting would fit, it'd be a different story. You could use something <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_tree" rel="noreferrer">like this</a>, but the question doesn't call for it.</p>

<p>As for the rest of your code, a few things stood out to me:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>does_not_overlap?</code> is a bit odd</p>

<ul>
<li>it's a negative assertion, rather than <code>overlaps?</code></li>
<li>why not pass in a <code>Meeting</code> instance instead of start and end times?</li>
<li>and it's got a syntax error (hanging <code>||</code>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><code>ConferenceRoom</code> should use the <code>attr_accessor</code> you created or at least <code>@meetings</code> â€“ not <code>self.meetings</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>You <code>raise</code> which, yes, is a sort of output, but it's a bit much. All the question needs is a boolean answer.</p></li>
</ul>

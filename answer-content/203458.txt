<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>The query you need is like</p>

<pre><code>SELECT emploee_name, DATE(reattemptdate), count(*) cnt 
FROM orders WHERE DATE(reattemptdate) &gt; DATE(NOW() - INTERVAL 7 DAY)
GROUP BY emploee_name, DATE(reattemptdate)
</code></pre>

<p>However, its performance could be <em>worse</em> than that of 700 separate queries. Index have to be created carefully, with emploee_name, DATE(reattemptdate) al the last elements of it. For the purpose you may need to create a separate column consists of the result DATE(reattemptdate).</p>

<p>To get the result conveniently in PHP, you can use vanilla PDO which is significantly better than any stuff that you are using at the moment.</p>

<pre><code>$sql = "SELECT emploee_name, DATE(reattemptdate), count(*) cnt 
FROM orders WHERE DATE(reattemptdate) &gt; DATE(NOW() - INTERVAL 7 DAY)
GROUP BY emploee_name, DATE(reattemptdate)";
$data = $pdo-&gt;query($sql)-&gt;fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_GROUP);
</code></pre>

<p>will give you a convenient array where data will be <a href="https://phpdelusions.net/pdo/fetch_modes#FETCH_GROUP" rel="nofollow noreferrer">grouped by the employee name</a> which you can simply iterate over using a nested <code>foreach</code>.</p>

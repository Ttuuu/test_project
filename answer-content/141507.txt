<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>It is unclear how to use this class if I want to subscribe to two different objects that implement, say, <code>Value&lt;double&gt;</code>. There is no way to tell which of the two values has changed. This looks like a pretty major design flaw, unless I am missing something. So you should probably either use regular events (so I can supply different handlers for different values) or provide "source" argument. Personally, I think first option is better. You should also consider using proper event aggregator instead of storing the list of listeners in values themselves.</p>

<p>Also I think you should have an actual property instead of <code>Get()</code> and <code>Set()</code> methods. And you can make <code>listeners</code> field read-only.</p>

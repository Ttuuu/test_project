<li>Order your includes at least by portable / non-portable.</li>
<li>Not a huge fan of omitting <code>private</code> and putting all the private members up top. IMO a class interface should go from <code>public</code> to <code>private</code> which makes for easier reading as a user.</li>
<li>The whole thing is a bit hard to read. Some linebreaks and maybe even spaces would make this easier on the eyes.</li>
<li>Is there a reason not to use <code>memset</code> in your clear function?</li>
<li>Pedantic people might complain about the missing header for <code>size_t</code> and the missing <code>std::</code> qualifier.</li>
<li><code>std::string output = "";</code> initializing strings this way always looks weird to me. <code>std::string s;</code> should suffice but to declare intent more clearly you can do <code>std::string{""};</code>. Purely subjective though.</li>
<li>Always a good idea to get into the habit of <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/59880/avoid-postfix-increment-operator">using prefix operator over postfix</a> operator.</li>
<li>I do like that you signal intent with <code>flush</code> as opposed to relying on <code>endl</code></li>
<li>Not sure if you use <code>Color</code> elsewhere but it could probably be an implementation detail instead of being free.</li>
<li>You explicitly state this is for linux so you probably know that <code>system("clear")</code> is non-portable and are okay with it.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first thing I notice when looking at this code is the lack of documentation.</p>

<p>I would provide some more operators. Specifically I would go for <code>operator&lt;</code> so <code>type_id_t</code> is usable as key for <code>std::map</code> and you should think about specializing <code>std::hash</code> so the class can be used with hash maps.</p>

<p>As the code is pretty short I don't find any more to say about it. </p>

<p>Btw.: Well done. I like this solution very much.</p>

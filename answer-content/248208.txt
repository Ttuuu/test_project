<p>There is a subtle bug:</p>
<pre><code>Process32First(snapshot, &amp;entry)
</code></pre>
<p>already fills <code>entry</code> with the information about the first process in the snapshot. Your code misses that entry because <code>Process32Next()</code> is called immediately. The loop structure should be</p>
<pre><code>if (Process32First(snapshot, &amp;entry) == TRUE) {
    do {
        // ... do something with `entry`...
        
    } while (Process32Next(snapshot, &amp;entry) == TRUE);
}
</code></pre>
<p>instead. Other things that come into my mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the program is called with the wrong number of arguments then the error/usage message should be printed to the <em>standard error</em> and the program should terminate with a <em>non-zero</em> exit code, e.g. <code>EXIT_FAILURE</code>.</li>
<li>The return value of <code>CreateToolhelp32Snapshot()</code> is not checked.</li>
<li><code>PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS</code> is not needed in the call to <code>OpenProcess</code>, only <code>PROCESS_TERMINATE</code>.</li>
<li>The return values of <code>OpenProcess()</code> and <code>TerminateProcess()</code> are not checked. I would expect a diagnostic message if they fail. In particular, <code>TerminateProcess()</code> and <code>CloseHandle()</code> should only be called if <code>OpenProcess()</code> succeeded.</li>
<li>It may be a matter of taste, but <code>== TRUE</code> can be omitted when checking a boolean condition.</li>
<li>As a user of this tool I would expect some feedback to see if a matching process was found, and how many processes were killed.</li>
</ul>

<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>In the first part of your snippet, you can calculate the frequency in the place of '0' by finding the 'text.count' for each character in the 'text' itself. This will help you to avoid using 'if-statement' inside 'for-statement' and keeping your code clean and short.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>text = 'StackExchange Code Review'
frequency = {chr(ltr) : text.lower().count(chr(ltr)) for ltr in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1)}
total = sum(frequency.values())
</code></pre>

<p>Note: 'if-statement', based on the 'text' in your snippet, checks for the space character which is absolutely not existed in the 'frequency', and thus, extra steps of execution.</p>

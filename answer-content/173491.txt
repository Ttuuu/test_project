<h3>DRY and Data Structures</h3>

<p>Income and expenses are the same thing, just with different signs. You can cut about half your code by more fully leveraging this.</p>

<p>Currently, each of the two have a list of values, a list of labels, a sum variable, a prompt function, a "check", and a sum function. A more flexible data design might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>Entry = {
    value: &lt;int&gt;,
    label: &lt;str&gt;
}

entries = [Entry]
</code></pre>

<p>so that the value and label of each entry is stored together, which is a lot cleaner than the <code>dict(zip(...</code> business. An expense would just be an entry with a negative value.</p>

<p>You can still prompt for input in two phases, if you want, but just store them both in the same format internally.</p>

<p>You can then consolidate functions. Skipping a bit of error handling, your class becomes something more like:</p>

<pre><code>class Application:

    def __init__(self):
        self.entries = []
        self.main()

    def prompt(self, type):
        while True:
            more = input('Enter %s? [y/n] ' % type).lower()
            if more == 'n':
                break

            value = int(input('Enter %s amount (numbers only): ' % type))
            label = input('Enter %s name' % type)

            self.entries.append({
                'value': value if type == 'income' else -value,
                'label': label
            })

    def main(self):
        self.prompt('income')
        self.prompt('expense')

        # This is easy now, since the sign is attached to the data
        balance = sum(entry['value'] for entry in entries)
        self.print_balance_message(balance)
</code></pre>

<h3>Simplify</h3>

<ul>
<li>Do you need to print the list of income / expenses after the user entered it? Presumably the entire history is still on their screen?</li>
<li>Why not allow the user to enter both types at once? I'd be a little annoyed if I was entering my incomes, then expenses, then wait -- I forgot an income -- do I have to start over?</li>
</ul>

<p>Can you clarify what you want us to feed back on.</p>

<p>My thoughts are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use a library that already performs infix mathematical parsing because the process is relatively complex but has been "solved" many times before.</li>
<li>Your code assumes a very strict order in the the operations.  That doesn't make it very extensible.</li>
<li>Try adding validation.  instead of <code>Convert.ToInt32(res)</code>, use <code>int.TryParse(res, out n)</code>.  if the function returns false, you know the parse failed and you can handle it as you feel fit.</li>
<li>Maybe <code>Trim()</code> your res on each loop - although you will need to assign it to a new variable (e.g. <code>var res2 = res.Trim();</code>)</li>
</ol>

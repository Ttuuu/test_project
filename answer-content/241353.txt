<p>In my comment I said that this would be a lot shorter if you used <a href="https://jquery.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">JQuery</a>. Now I don't want to say that JQuery is better than plain Javascript. There may be a good reason to not use JQuery. But I do want to show what the code would look like in JQuery.</p>

<pre><code>$(".filter-btn").click(function() {
  let type = $(this).data("filter");
  let filter = (type == "all") ? "*" : "[data-filterType='"+type+"']";
  $(".grid div").hide().filter(filter).show();  
});
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, this is a lot less verbose. You can see <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/KIKO_Software/psz6g0f2" rel="nofollow noreferrer">a live demo here</a>.</p>

<p>I think it goes too far to explain this JQuery code in detail. In broad terms it does this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event of your buttons.</li>
<li>Extract the filter type from the data attribute of the clicked button.</li>
<li>Based on that it creates a filter variable that selects the grid items to be shown.</li>
<li>First hide all grid items and then only show the filtered ones.</li>
</ol>

<p>It is the last line that does all the work.</p>

<p>I intentionally didn't change the HTML so this works on the same HTML as you have now. </p>

<h3>Syntax errors</h3>

<p>The posted code has some syntax errors:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>  git reset --soft "HEAD~$(no_of_commits)" &amp;&amp;
    git add --all &amp;&amp;
    git commit --fixup "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" &amp;&amp;
    GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR=true git rebase --interactive --autosquash --no-fork-point "$(git rev-parse HEAD~2)" &amp;&amp;
    echo "Rebased $(no_of_commits) succesfully!"
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>That is, all the <code>$(no_of_commits)</code> must really be <code>$no_of_commits</code> or <code>${no_of_commits}</code> if you like.</p>

<h3>Use <code>git commit --amend</code></h3>

<p><code>git commit --fixup</code> is useful when you will have a bunch of fixup commits in the midst of other commits. To squash together the last N commits, is a special case, and can be done simpler using <code>git reset ... &amp;&amp; git commit --amend</code>:</p>

<pre><code>  git reset --soft "HEAD~$no_of_commits" &amp;&amp;
    git commit --amend -C HEAD
    echo "Rebased $no_of_commits successfully!"
</code></pre>

<p>I also dropped the <code>git add --all</code> in the middle, because it's not necessary for the purpose you described, in fact it may have unintended effects.
That is, any uncommitted changes will get added. If I want to fixup the last N commits, I would want "just that", and nothing else. If I wanted the uncommitted changes included, I would commit them.</p>

<h3>Use more functions</h3>

<p>I would extract the conditional that checks if <code>$no_of_commits</code> is a number to its own function.
Then you could easily copy-paste and reuse in other scripts.</p>

<p>Also, the <code>elif</code> should use <code>$no_of_commits</code> instead of <code>$1</code>.</p>

<h3>About rebasing...</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this review, I'm most interested in knowing whether my approach to git is a proper one, especially if it doesn't break anything during rebasing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Collapsing the last N commits isn't really <em>rebasing</em>, because no commits are applied on top of some other commit, it's really just <em>amending</em> a commit.</p>

<p>As mentioned in the previous section, I think the <code>git add --all</code> operation is a mistake, which I would consider a defect of the otherwise nice functionality.</p>

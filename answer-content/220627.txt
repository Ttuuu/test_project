<p>If your question is whether the recursive function could be made shorter, then the following is a way to rephrase your function in a more compact form:</p>

<pre><code>def recur_fibonacci(n):
   return n if n &lt;= 1 else recur_fibonacci(n-1) + recur_fibonacci(n-2)
</code></pre>

<p>This is assuming you must have a recursive solution. As others have already pointed out, the solution could be made more time-efficient by using a simple linear loop instead of recursion.</p>

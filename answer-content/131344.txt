<p>Most tems have already been covered so I'll only give 1 other observation. 
You keep calling calculator instead of allowing the functions to return. .. eventually your program would crash with a "stack overflow" error. (OK it will take a while from human input but it's bad practice).</p>

<p>I would consider a while loop (repeat the prompt until they hit a key to exit or what not).</p>

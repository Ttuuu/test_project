<p>One thing I don't like is, that you merge "in place" - that is: the input linked lists change as a side effect. I would expect them to be untouched by the method. Consider to make a new linked list as the result.</p>

<hr>

<p>As a micro optimization you could probably spare a couple of ticks, if the input lists contain a lot of duplicate values, by iterate to the first node with a greater value in the second loop:</p>

<pre><code>  while (heap.Count &gt; 0)
  {
    ListNode node = heap.ExtractDominating();
    tail.next = node;

    while (node.next != null &amp;&amp; node.val == node.next.val)
    {
      node = node.next;
    }

    if (node.next != null)
    {
      heap.Add(node.next);
    }
      tail = node;

  }
</code></pre>
    </div>

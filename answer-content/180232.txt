<p>If I’m understanding your question correctly, you’re just a little disoriented by Python’s code block style, which is only spaces without the curly braces {} that are found in many other languages.</p>

<p>I also found this disorienting initially, but you quickly get used to it.</p>

<p>I can recommend using an editor / IDE that nicely supports Python - PyCharm is a good one.</p>

<p>Otherwise unless you’re actually adding a multline comment, you can replace the “”” with a single leading # for a single line comment which might be a bit easier to read until you get used to the “”” style.</p>

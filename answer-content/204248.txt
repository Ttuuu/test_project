<p>Here is my final working code</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; characters.length; i++) {
    int number = getDecimal(characters[i]);
    for (int j = 0; j &lt; 8; j++) {
        result.insert(i * 9, (number % 2 == 0) ? 0 : 1);
        number = (int) (number &gt;&gt; 1);
    }
    // put a space if it isn't the last string
    if (i &lt; characters.length - 1)
        result.insert(8 * (i + 1) + i, " ");
}

public int getDecimal(char character) {
    return character;
}
</code></pre>

<p>What I did?</p>

<ul>
<li>I initialized the integer variable number inside the loop. I dunno why, just 
wanted to do it, think it is more organized now.</li>
<li>I used conditional operator known as Ternary Operator instead of the
if/else. Reason is because it is shorter and looks more neat.</li>
<li>Made it put the bit at the beginning (first index) and after the loop runs,
it puts a space at the end (after the last character).</li>
<li>Used the shifting operator instead of the division as recommended
below, may be faster.</li>
<li>Why <code>i*9</code> for the first loop? Cause i will start of with 0, so it is always 
going to put the character in the index 0. Then when i increments and becomes 
1, it is going to be 9. Here if you realize, the 8 bits take the positions 0,7 
then space at 8 and the new word binary sequence starts at 9. Therefore, the 
printing is <code>(8 * (i+1))</code> for a loop for 3, will give 8, 17, 26 which is where 
we need the spaces.</li>
<li>Changed the get decimal number from ASCII character function and made it
shorter by just returning the decimal of the character. No need for the if 
statements or for loops.</li>
</ul>

<p>I made a simple debug for those of you who are confused or don't get it
after the insert method add this</p>

<pre><code>System.out.println("j:" + j + " Current number? " + number + " remainder is " + number % 2);
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>i:0</p>
  
  <p>j:0 Current number? 97 remainder is 1</p>
  
  <p>j:1 Current number? 48 remainder is 0</p>
  
  <p>j:2 Current number? 24 remainder is 0</p>
  
  <p>j:3 Current number? 12 remainder is 0</p>
  
  <p>j:4 Current number? 6 remainder is 0</p>
  
  <p>j:5 Current number? 3 remainder is 1</p>
  
  <p>j:6 Current number? 1 remainder is 1</p>
  
  <p>j:7 Current number? 0 remainder is 0</p>
  
  <p>Binary code for a is 01100001</p>

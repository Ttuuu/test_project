<p>The other obvious alternative, which you haven’t contemplated here, is to design it right in the storyboard or NIB in Interface Builder, which would eliminate all of this code. </p>

<p>The only view creation related code that I would put in the view controller is those just-in-time adjustments/subviews that cannot be determined at design-time, but rather are dictated by the presence or absence of relevant model data. </p>

<p>Anyway, if you do that, then the view controller can focus on its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiviewcontroller" rel="nofollow noreferrer">core responsibilities</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A view controller’s main responsibilities include the following:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Updating the contents of the views, usually in response to changes to the underlying data.</li>
  <li>Responding to user interactions with views.</li>
  <li>Resizing views and managing the layout of the overall interface.</li>
  <li>Coordinating with other objects—including other view controllers—in your app.</li>
  </ul>

<p><strong>Naming</strong></p>

<p>The Java naming convention for arguments is camelCase. You should rename this argument <code>A</code> here: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>public int solution(int[] A) 
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>It would be best to make it look like the following code, or use a better name that would fit your needs:</p>

<pre><code>public int solution(int[] arrayA) 
</code></pre>

<p>I don't have anything against a variable named <code>arr</code> for an <code>int []</code>, but you're using <code>arr</code> and <code>array</code> in different methods. I would recommend to stick to one name, or try to find less generic name if they mean different things.</p>

<p><strong>Formatting</strong></p>

<p>Your formatting is very good in general, and you're consistent. Some times, you could use a little bit of white-space.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>for(int i=1;i&lt;sizeOfArray;i++)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>You could add some spaces to clearly define the three part of the for-loop:</p>

<pre><code>for(int i=1; i&lt;sizeOfArray; i++)
</code></pre>

<p>I will not evaluate your algorithm, since this is not my forte.</p>

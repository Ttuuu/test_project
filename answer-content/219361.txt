<p>It is possible the interview failed because of the 4th line in the code:</p>

<pre><code>using namespace std;
</code></pre>

<p>Code such as a template class will generally be in a header file, and it is very bad practice to have the <code>using namespace std;</code> within a header file, it breaks all the reasons for having namespaces. What happens if someone wants to use this class as a base class but needs to write special <code>cin</code> and <code>cout</code> overloads, or overload any of the library functions provided by <code>namespace std</code>?</p>

<p>In general professions will never default to the <code>std namespace</code>. Namespaces are used to prevent collisions of functions see this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1452721/why-is-using-namespace-std-considered-bad-practice">stackoverflow question</a>.</p>

<p>The second problem with <code>using namespace std</code> is that it isn't necessary, the code compiles without it. </p>

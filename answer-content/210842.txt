<p>In the constructor that take a vector, you might want to validate the size and raise an exception if it does not match the expected size.</p>

<p>Since you are using <code>operator()</code> to update a value, why not replace <code>getElement</code> by a const version of <code>operator()</code>? That way, you won't have to use different code for read and for write access.</p>

<p><code>isAddSubLegal</code> and <code>isMultLegal</code> should probably be private as they are not intended for public use.</p>

<p>I am not sure if <code>operator==</code> and <code>operator!=</code> should be declared. The fact that an epsilon is used for comparison is a red flag. If you need to compare with some tolerance, it might be preferable to use a function that take an additional parameter for the tolerance to use. For an internal library, I would not make such function available unless I actually need it.</p>

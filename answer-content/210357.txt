<p>I know the root of all evil is premature optimization, but I would first ask if this is expected to be either a hotspot or usef with large strings.</p>

<p>Because it can be made much more readable using the array methods, but doing so obviously comes with a performance cost. OTOH, your method has its own performance issues.</p>

<p>If this isn’t expected to be particularly performance sensitive, I think that a straightforward method that turned the two strings into arrays then used the filter or map method to generate an array that is then turned into a string would be much more readable, and I prefer readable over performant as long as the performance isn’t a problem.</p>

<p>One additional point, what should your function return for “a”, “aa”? currently it returns “aa”?</p>

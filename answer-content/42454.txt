<p><strong>Scope</strong> - Objects and variables should be defined with the most restrictive scope possible, considering their use.  Properties and methods that are only going to be used in the class they're defined in should be marked <code>private</code>.  For instance, all of the properties you define for the class <code>Machine</code> should be <code>private</code>.  Properties that are only used in a single method should be declared in that method.  For instance, <code>num1</code>, <code>num2</code> and <code>att</code> can all have their declarations moved into the methods that use them.  </p>

<p>And a style point about scope.  Although some people don't like it, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/725770/should-the-java-this-keyword-be-used-when-it-is-optional">consider using the this keyword for all object properties</a>.  For instance, you would write <code>this.ans</code> instead of just <code>ans</code>.  Whoever reads your code will immediately see that <code>ans</code> is not a local variable.  Although most IDEs will color your object properties differently from local variables, some places (like CodeReview) won't.  </p>

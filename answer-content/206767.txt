<p>Take a look at this portion of your code:</p>

<pre><code>found=True
 lst.sort()

 while found and Lbound&lt;=Ubound:
</code></pre>

<p>You set found to true before checking if it exists. Here you should set it to false before you run the loop.</p>

<p>Also, please keep in mind, as mentioned in the comments to your question, that questions regarding logic and algorithms are better suited for <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a>, CodeReview is for already working code, to either further optimize it or improve it. Please be careful of that in the future.</p>

<p>Hope that answers your question!</p>

<p>I have already used similar code and it looks rather fine. Some nitpicks:</p>

<ul>
<li>I’d name the variable <code>cls</code> to mimic the name often used as first parameters of <code>@classmethod</code>s; or <code>class_</code> as it is more common;</li>
<li>I’d store a list of classes intead of a list of names, this feels more directly usable (and names are still stored as <code>cls.__name__</code> if need be);</li>
<li><code>sys.modules[__name__].__name__</code> should be just <code>__name__</code>.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Alternatively, since these classes seems related to each other, you may have an inheritance tree; or maybe a common base class. In this case, you could be even more specific using something such as:</p>

<pre><code>[cls for _, cls in inspect.getmembers(my_module, inspect.isclass) if issubclass(cls, my_module.CommonBase)]
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>my_module.CommonBase.__subclasses__()
</code></pre>

<p>if there really is a single level of inheritance, but I wouldn't count much on it as it can break so easily.</p>

<p>You can replace this pipeline</p>

<pre><code>head -1 *.txt | awk '/[a-z]/&amp;&amp;!/.txt/' | awk '{print $3}'
</code></pre>

<p>with this one awk command</p>

<pre><code>awk 'FNR == 1 {print $3}' *.txt
</code></pre>

<p><code>FNR</code> is the <strong>file</strong> record (i.e. line) number. <code>NR</code> is the <em>cumulative</em> record number of all records seen from all files.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now, you can select the user's numeric choice with</p>

<pre><code>awk 'FNR == 1 {print $3}' *.txt | awk -v n="$user_selection" 'NR == n'
</code></pre>

<p>or, with a single awk:</p>

<pre><code>awk -v n="$user_selection" 'FNR == 1 &amp;&amp; ++filenum == n {print $3; exit}' *.txt
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>If you're looking for a way to get your users to select a name from one of the files, perhaps some more advanced bash:</p>

<pre><code># read the 3rd word from the 1st line of all txt files into an array
readarray -t names &lt; &lt;(awk 'FNR == 1 {print $3}' *.txt)

# get the user to select one of them
PS3="Choose a name: "
select name in "${names[@]}"; do
    [ "$name" ] &amp;&amp; break
done

echo "$name"
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>This really isn't a code review. Since you're asking "how can I do this", you should have asked on Stack Overflow.</p>

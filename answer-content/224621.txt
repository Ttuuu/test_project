<p>I like the way your function is documented by a doc string and comments.</p>

<p>Why use the inner loop?<br>
If you want another "early out" compared to "the set approach", use a map and "index" that with the characters.</p>

<p>You compare <code>found_character[index]</code> to True, but set it to <code>1</code>, which is all the more irritating as it is commented <code>Set [â€¦] to True</code></p>

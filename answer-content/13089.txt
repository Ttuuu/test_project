<p>Maybe you can reason as follows:</p>

<p>Multiplying all the numbers together from 1-&gt;10 gives you <code>3628800</code> which is indeed divisible by the numbers 1-&gt;10, but it is not the minimum number.  Ask yourself why?  take the last number 10 for instance.  Do we really need to multiply 10 into our answer 10, when we know that our number already has a factor of 2 and a factor of 5?</p>

<p>Consider the prime factors of the numbers 1-&gt;10</p>

<p>factors:</p>

<pre><code> 1 - 1
 2 - 2
 3 - 3
 4 - 2*2   (2^2)
 5 - 5
 6 - 2*3
 7 - 7
 8 - 2*2*2 (2^3)
 9 - 3*3   (3^2)
10 - 2*5
</code></pre>

<p>What's the most number of 2's you need to create any of the values 1-&gt;10...? 3 (8=2^3)<br>
What's the most number of 3's? 2 (9=3^2)<br>
What's the most number of 5's? 1 (5)<br>
What's the most number of 7's? 1 (7)<br>
Thus, the answer for the minimum number that is a multiple of 1-&gt;10, is 2^3*3^2*5*7 = 2520.<br>
You can extend this logic for 1-&gt;20 and you'll get a much quicker algorithm than what you've proposed.</p>

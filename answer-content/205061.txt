<p>Are the cleaners and clients supposed to be authenticated, maybe they should inherit from AUTH_USER_MODE or a base user? When using the ORM you want the object to have the name to the models on the foreign Key i.e <code>client = models.ForeignKey(Client)</code>. By default, all these models have indexes for the pk, are your querying every object using the pk (i.e the id)?</p>

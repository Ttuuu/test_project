<p>Your naming scheme is clear and I like that you have used a function to find the second lowest grade. A small suggestion is to use
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/419163/what-does-if-name-main-do"><code>if __name__ == "__main__":</code></a> module in your code. It makes it easier to reuse for later and is a good standard.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with your code is the <em>logic</em> you use. You first make a list of students great! But then you split them into grades and students, why? The idea here is surely to use dictionaries, and this makes the problem easy to solve. See <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/133231/61495">Mathias Ettinger</a> answer for an excellent solution using pythons dictionaries.

<h2>A different algorithm</h2>

<p>Imagine the input is 10 million names, storing the variables and sorting is very expensive. Eg it takes a long time. Luckily there is a faster approach! Since the names are inputted one by one, we need to keep track of the lowest and second lowest names.</p>

<pre><code>students_lowest = []
lowest_grade = float("inf")

students_second_lowest = []
second_lowest_grade = float("inf")

for pupil in range(int(input())):
    name, grade = input(), float(input())
    if grade &lt; lowest_grade:
        students_second_lowest = list(students_lowest)
        students_lowest = [name]
        second_lowest_grade = lowest_grade
        lowest_grade = grade
    elif grade == lowest_grade:
        students_lowest.append(name)
    elif grade &lt; second_lowest_grade:
        students_second_lowest = [name]
        second_lowest_grade = grade
    elif grade == second_lowest_grade:
        students_second_lowest.append(name)

for name in sorted(students_second_lowest):
    print(name)
</code></pre>

<p>This keeps a list of the names with the lowest and second lowest scores. At the very end before printing it sorts the list of students with the second lowest grade. This is a much smaller list. If you have any questions regarding the code above feel free to ask. </p>

<p>I would suggest there are better ways than using the <code>Microsoft.VisualBasic</code> libraries.  This isn't just because you are using C#; I have given the same advice many times in the past to those using VB.NET.</p>

<p>There are a lot of links on how to read text with .NET.  Here is one using <code>System.IO</code>:</p>

<p>To split the fields, there is the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.string.split(v=vs.110).aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">String.Split</a> method.</p>

<p>For reading the specific fields, see the answer from @Heslacher.  Pay attention to his other tips such as naming, etc.  Speaking of naming, <code>MassUploadUser</code> is not a very good name.  I would suggest something simpler and more direct, such as <code>User</code>, or <code>Person</code>, or <code>Employee</code>.</p>

<p>I note you are reading one line at a time, and posting one line at a time.  You may consider doing this in bulk, in which case you would want a <code>List&lt;User&gt;</code> (or <code>List&lt;MassUploadUser&gt;</code>).</p>

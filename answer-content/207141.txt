<p>Some quick remarks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>FindContentOfWordDoc</code> is a bad class name, in the first place because it contains a verb. Please follow the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/names-of-classes-structs-and-interfaces" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Microsoft rules</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>While this code only does a search, it is peppered with names that refer to "find and replace". This makes it hard to understand. I assume this must be due to Aspose, so perhaps this is inevitable, but then perhaps you could add some comments to explain why you implemented it this way.</p>
<p>Are you certain this is the best way to execute a search? I find it odd that you would need to "abuse" the "find and replace" functionality; it seems odd that Aspose would include that functionality yet not a "find" on its own.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You don't check <code>content</code>: is this function only intended for single word queries, or also for combinations of words? And why not check if the user actually entered a search term, in order to avoid invoking the callback etc. on a <code>null</code> or an empty string?</p>
</li>
</ul>

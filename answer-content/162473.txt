<p>Do not <em>manually</em> call <code>Dispose()</code>, you will end-up having some duplication (and you're not even disposing those resources in case of errors...). Use <code>using()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>using (var graphics = new Graphics())
{
    // Your code here...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also do not create a new <code>Font</code> for each page, reuse the same one for all pages. Maybe it's time to move this code into its own separate class with its instance fields?</p>

<p>You do not need to create a <code>SolidBrush(Color.Black)</code>, just use <code>Brush.Black</code>.
Is <code>if (offsetY &gt;= pageWidth-100)</code> correct? You're comparing Y offset with page width.</p>

<p>Note that I suppose <code>elemente</code> and <code>b</code> are instance fields, you might want to make it clear: <code>this.elemente</code> and <code>this.b</code> or rename them to <code>_b</code> and <code>_elemente</code>. Also <code>b</code> isn't best name for an object might it be <code>barcodeImageConverter</code> (guessing from parameters), it's hard to understand what it does without reading the full-code and thinking about it. Also <code>elemente</code> may be something like <code>latestPrintedElement</code>.</p>

<p>Get rid of all those hard-coded constants, they will make your code a nightmare to maintain. Use <code>private const int</code> (or <code>float</code>) for them and you will also gain in readability.</p>

<p>I'd say that memory consumption come from <code>b.Encode()</code> method but we don't have any idea about what it is and what it does. Does it create a bard-code image for the given text? An educate guess may be that you need to <strong>manually dispose images</strong> generated by <code>b.EncodedImage</code> after you used them and before you create a new one calling <code>Encode()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>b.EncodedImage?.Dispose();
b.Encode(TYPE.CODE128A, ...
</code></pre>

<p>All this said...to fix memory issues nothing is better than a memory profiler...</p>

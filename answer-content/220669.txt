<p>This is a code inspection so it's my role to raise questions, not to answer them. I haven't run your code. Did you check your end condition? It appears to me that the first player, let's say it's x, goes on turn_count 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. In the loop when turn_count is 8 you will accept input from x, place it on the board, then increment turn_count to 9 and break out of the loop. The end condition then checks that count is nine and concludes it's a tie. Thus any game that fills the board is classed a draw, without checking it.</p>

<p>The best solution for that is to move the turn count check into the while condition, testing it second, and saving the result of the win checking in a variable for testing outside the loop.</p>

<p>You can also turn the while-do into a do-while since neither a win nor an exceeded turn count can occur at the beginning.</p>

<p>Then make sure you test a game with a player winning with a full board.</p>

<p>And please, even if you can't spell-check your comments as the current best answer suggests, at the very least ensure that all your printed output is spelled correctly! If you start working for a company producing real code those typos are simply an embarrassing proof that the code was never reviewed or thoroughly tested.</p>

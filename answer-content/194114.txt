<p>This is my understanding of MVC.</p>

<p>The Model should handle all the logic and it knows the state of the board, such as where the pieces are, and the state for a Win. </p>

<p>The view only displays things like the board, menu and gamestate like winner. </p>

<p>The controller handles the communication between the user, view and model.
For instance, it updates the model based on user input, and updates the view based on the model.</p>

<p>Someone stated the model "may have some business logic" and to my understanding, this is not really the case. It is supposed to be where most all of the business logic is, and it is in the exceptions that some biz logic shows up else where, not the other way around.</p>

<p>This means the checkBoardForWin should be in the model</p>

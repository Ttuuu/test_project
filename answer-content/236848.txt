<p>in addition to what has already been said, I'd suggest not using <code>clientExists</code> at all.  just have a <code>UNIQUE</code> constraint on <code>clientName, siteName</code> and let the database enforce this for you.  </p>

<p>the reason is that your current code is both doing more work than is needed (the check for existence) as well not enough (the gap between the existence check and inserting a new row is a race condition).  generally the best place to handle this sort of check is the database</p>

<p>see e.g. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/3146838/1358308">https://stackoverflow.com/q/3146838/1358308</a> for how to handle this with MySQL.  I've not programmed PHP for a few years so don't know if there are any nice ways to handle this that generalise to other database engines.</p>

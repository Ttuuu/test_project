<p>You don't have much code written, so I'm not really sure how much help you're likely to get here.</p>

<p>A couple of points:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There's no reason to call it <code>PlayerClass</code>. Just call it <code>Player</code> since the word <code>class</code> appears right next to it.</p></li>
<li><p>You are using <code>PlayerClass</code> as the base class for your other three classes. But you are not calling <code>super</code> in your initializer function, and not taking advantage of inheritance. Try this:</p>

<pre><code>class Swordsman(Player):
    def __init__(self, *, damage=50, strength=100, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(damage=damage, strength=strength, **kwargs)
</code></pre>

<p>And see Raymond Hettinger's <a href="https://rhettinger.wordpress.com/2011/05/26/super-considered-super/" rel="noreferrer">guide to using <code>super</code></a> for more pro-tips. The idea here is to override the default attribute values on a per-class basis (dmg and str, in this case) but have the root class do all the attribute-setting, since it's all the same except for the values.</p></li>
</ol>

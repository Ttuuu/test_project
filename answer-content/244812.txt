<p>In addition to @Linny's answer, I can comment on the following topics:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Use correct method names. <code>getGrades</code> method gets grade input and displays student's status. You should name it accordingly. Actually, your <code>getGrades</code> method does <strong>two</strong> different things which is a violation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Single Responsibility Principle</a>. Dividing it into two methods such as <code>getGrades</code> and <code>displayResult</code> could be a better solution.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Try to handle exceptions. While getting grade input, you tried to cast it to double. However, user input might not be converted to double (For example: supply 'a' as input) after which <code>NumberFormatException</code> is thrown. You should not ignore such errors/exceptions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Avoid writing duplicate code. <code>getStudentName</code> and <code>getStudentCourse</code> methods are doing almost the same thing. Defining a common method for this purpose can reduce code repetition.</p>
</li>
</ol>

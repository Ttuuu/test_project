<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>As both players are handled the same:</p>
<pre><code>// TODO: define marker = char array {' ', 'X', 'O'}

void switchPlayers(){
    printf("     Player %d choose: ", player);
    scanf("%d", &amp;choice);
    // I inverted logic of the if!
    if (!markBoard(marker[player])) {
       player = 3 - player;
    }
    // ... the else can be dropped as player did not change and does not need to be changed
}
</code></pre>
<p>(Not a great improvement. In case of more players this would be wise.)</p>
    </div>

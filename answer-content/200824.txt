<p>Few observations.</p>

<p>I. You don't need to scan the whole string, character-by-character. <code>str.find('$')</code> will do it for you (and remember to start the second search, and all subsequent ones, from the last reference detected.)</p>

<p>II. Rather than taking substrings, parsing them, erasing and insertingâ€”why not increment in-place? You know exactly your number span (from the one past '$' to the one past the last digit.) If this string only consists of '9's, insert a single '1' right after '$' and change all nines into zeroes. If there are digits less than nine, increment the rightmost non-nine, and change all the subsequent nines into zeroes, if any, no insertion/erasure required. Proceed with the next search.</p>

<p>III. As @AJNeufeld mentioned, string reconstruction can be done in a separate buffer, though vast testing is needed to decide if this is a faster option.</p>

<p>I think the most important things to which you should pay attention are:  </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Avoid code duplication.</strong> Every time you find yourself writing the same or similar code even twice, think about using loops (hint: your <code>load</code> method) or extracting the code into a function (hint: <code>dead</code> method). The two most evident out of many existing reasons to avoid code duplication: 1) the code becomes shorter 2) if you need to change something in the logic that is repeated, you need to do it in only one place.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do not use global variables.</strong> You should use them in very very rare cases. Instead, make functions exchange values via parameters. You may want to google why using global variables is so bad.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dicts instead of multilevel elif statements</strong>. If you have something like:</p>

<pre><code>if x==1:
    y = 'a'
    z = 67
elif x==2:
    y = 'b'
    z = 77
elif x == 3:
    y = 'c'
    z = 87
...
</code></pre>

<p>probably you would want to you a <em>dictionary</em> instead: </p>

<pre><code>dict_name = {1: ('a', 67), 2: ('b', 77), 3: ('c',87)}
y,z = dict_name[x]
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Regarding <strong>printing</strong>. First, format the string you want to print, then print it (do not call <code>print</code> 3 times to display one sentence). Also, avoid adding strings (with +) </p>

<p>If you use python of version 3.6 and higher, you can you so-called <em>f-strings</em> instead:</p>

<pre><code>print(f'You have {health} remaining')
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise:</p>

<pre><code>print('You have {0} remaining'.format(health))
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

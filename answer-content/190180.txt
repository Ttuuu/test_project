<p>python has a binary search implementation: <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/bisect.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/2/library/bisect.html</a></p>

<p>so just:</p>

<pre><code>import bisect
ind = bisect.bisect_left(arr, target)
</code></pre>

<p>if you get ind &gt; len(arr)-2, then the solution is arr[-1]. Otherwise you just hceck arr[ind] and arr[ind+1] to find whichever is closest</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, if you implemented your own binary search it should be just as fast. However, having a two line implementation is easier to read than defining your own functions</p>

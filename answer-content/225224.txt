<p>I don't understand why encryption would be "hard" - the code above looks straightforward enough although I'm not sure you need the padding (never tried the new crypto APIs).</p>

<p>Do note that if you want to secure your UUIDs (why?), you probably want to add a random IV to your UUIDs otherwise you'll probably expose too much information - UUIDs have some bits very static. Generally speaking, rolling your own crypto protocol is fraught with error; I would use an existing library like Hashids (<a href="https://hexdocs.pm/hashids/Hashids.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://hexdocs.pm/hashids/Hashids.html</a>) because that protocol has been analyzed and you're probably better off with the mild known weaknesses in such a library than some huge unknown weakness lurking in roll-your-own :).</p>

<p>But for all practical purposes, generating v4 UUIDs using a cryptographically strong RNG should be all you need. </p>

<p>The names of the measurement units are wrong. Kelvin does not take a degree. It's just K, not Â°K. Fixing this requires changes to most of the code.</p>

<p>It's a waste of computation time to calculate all possible conversions and then only use one of them. You can be lucky that you are converting temperatures and not ancient lengths, of which there are hundreds.</p>

<p>The conversion function should convert from <code>Double</code> to <code>Double</code>. Otherwise there will be temperatures that change by a large amount when you repeatedly convert them between the units.</p>

<p>Looping over the indexes in the <code>ForEach</code> loops looks overly complicated to me. I'm sure that Swift provides a better way to fill a picker with an array. I've never programmed in Swift though, so I might be wrong.</p>

<p>The <code>return 0</code> is plain wrong and dangerous since converting an unknown temperature must result in an error message, not in a lie.</p>

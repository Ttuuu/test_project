<p>You should definitely see a huge improvement, by a factor of nearly N.<br>
The overhead that gets mentioned is in the microsecond range, and it is once per thread.</p>

<p>I have a similar example, where the runtime goes down by factors of 2, 4, 8, depending on the number of threads I start (up to the number of cores I have, of course).</p>

<p>I cannot tell you for sure why your example is not working; maybe the compiler was clever enough to run in multiple threads to begin with, or your executable does not get access to run more than one thread. Are you in a virtual machine maybe? Check <code>int N = std::thread::hardware_concurrency()</code> to see how many threads your program have access too.<br>
I think your code is correct, and should work.</p>

<p>I don't have experience in programming in C#, but I do have some regex advice to share.</p>

<p>You can DRY your pattern by </p>

<pre><code>(\d+)(?:ms|mili(?:secon)?s?)
(\d+)(?:s(?:ec)?|seconds?)
(\d+)(?:m|mins?)
(\d+)(?:h|hours?)
(\d+)(?:d|days?)
(\d+)(?:w|weeks?)
</code></pre>

<p>I am encouraging:</p>

<ul>
<li>non-capturing groups when there is no use for the matched substrings.</li>
<li>I am using the zero or more quantifier (<code>?</code>) to reduce repetition and alternation (pipes).</li>
<li>the omission of pipes in your character classes because they are useless in your expected input.</li>
<li><code>s?</code> to make pluralization optional.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you need to ensure that <code>m</code> is not followed by <code>s</code> when executing the minutes pattern, you will need to extend the pattern. Perhap <code>m(?!s)|mins?</code>.</p>

<p>If you are in control of the incoming strings, please correct the spelling of <code>milliseconds</code></p>

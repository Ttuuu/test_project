<li><p>It looks like a BlockingQueue not just SynchQueue</p></li>
<li><p><em>throw new RuntimeException("Doesn't allow storing nulls");</em> - there is <em>IllegalArgumnetException</em> for this.</p></li>
<li><p>It would better to add <em>throws InterruptedException</em> to method declaration rather than swallowing it.</p></li>
<li><p>You are going to add/remove from the tail/head of the internal buffer - LinkedList looks like better options for internal storage. You don't need tons of Array.Copy in this case. It would also remove those <em>tryDequeue()</em> and <em>tryEnqueue()</em> and greatly simplify the code. </p></li>
<li><p>This code doesn't work in a single thread scenario. Consider the situation when I call <em>enqueue()</em> for the first time on queue then <em>full.notify()</em> will fail immediately.</p></li>

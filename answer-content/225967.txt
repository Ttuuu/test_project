<p>We have no need to modify <code>data</code> - it should be a reference to <code>const</code>, so the caller can be guaranteed that we won't change the contents.</p>

<p>It appears that you have a <code>using std::vector</code> hidden somewhere - you should really show this as part of your review request.  It's generally best to keep such things out of the global namespace - use it only within the scope of a function.</p>

<p>None of your unit tests are shown in the review, so it's impossible to know if they are sufficiently complete (or, indeed, whether there are redundant tests).</p>

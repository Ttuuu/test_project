<p>If it's all about semantic then let's see what <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/semantics.html#the-article-element" rel="nofollow noreferrer">HTML5 specs</a> say (emphasis is mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The article element represents a component of a page that consists of a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site and that is intended to be independently distributable or reusable, e.g. in syndication. This could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, <strong>a user-submitted comment</strong>, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this case it seems that <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> is an appropriate choice for your comments. Is it <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> an appropriate container? I don't think it is, specs says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The section element represents a generic document or application section…The section element is not a generic container element. <strong>When an element is needed only for styling purposes or as a convenience for scripting, authors are encouraged to use the div element instead</strong>. A general rule is that the section element is appropriate only if the element’s contents would be listed explicitly in the document’s outline.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree that interpretation can be little bit subjective here but I'd take it literally: you do not have a specific header for this section. In your case if <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> is not to group a <em>section</em> of your document (for example an outer <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> with its list of comments) then I'd use the good old <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="comment-section"&gt;
  &lt;article&gt;
  &lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If, however, comments are just a <em>part</em> (section) of your main document which you may want to see in document outline and not simply a styling container (remember that it's important for screen-readers and all the others assistive tools) then don't refrain and use <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now let's talk about article content. You're using <code>&lt;h4&gt;</code> for styling purposes. I don't see whole page outline then I can't comment on this but keep in mind that heading elements should be used to denote an hypothetical structure, not for their styling. Imagine to replace your <code>&lt;h4&gt;Title&lt;/h4&gt;</code> with <code>&lt;div class="header"&gt;Title&lt;/div&gt;</code> where <code>div.header</code> is appropriately styled. Does the meaning of your document is lost? If answer is <em>no</em> then you're using heading elements because of styling and you shouldn't.</p>

<p>HTML5 introduced a new element  which <em>may</em> be appropriate in your case:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="comment-section"&gt;
  &lt;article&gt;
      &lt;header&gt;...&lt;/header&gt;
  &lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that even if you really want to keep  because of its meaning in document outline I'd wrap it inside an <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> section.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="comment-section"&gt;
  &lt;article&gt;
      &lt;header&gt;
          &lt;h4&gt;Title&lt;/h4&gt;
      &lt;/header&gt;
  &lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>What is it useful for? For example if <em>tomorrow</em> you will add <em>subtitle</em> to hold the date and the author of the comment...</p>

<p>Now let's think about <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>. First of all it has to have an <code>alt</code> attribute but I'd also consider to move it into its own <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> element. It may help screen readers to keep "focus" on the content. About this...do not forget to include all the proper <code>aria-</code> attributes!</p>

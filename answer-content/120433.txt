<p>Everyone has commented about how to better replace the spaces, I will answer how to better test.</p>

<p>I suggest making a <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/junit/junit_test_framework.htm" rel="nofollow">proper unit test with Junit</a>. This way you do not need to manually look at your output, you can simply run the test and it will tell you if it failed or passed. Unit testing is extremely crucial in a professional environment and is a very important skill to pick up early.</p>

<p>(The below assumes your class is named <code>MyClass</code>.)</p>

<pre><code>import org.junit.Assert;
import org.junit.Test;

public class MyClassTest
{

    @Test
    public void testSpaceReplacement()
    {
        Assert.assertEquals("All%20men%20must%20die", MyClass.replaceSpace("All men must die"));
    }

}
</code></pre>
    </div>

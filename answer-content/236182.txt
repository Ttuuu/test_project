<p>If "My target here is speed!" (and assuming you mean speed of execution) then the best advice is to move it into a compiled language.  There are many, many benefits to Python but execution speed is seldom one of them.</p>

<p>The first step, as Andre O suggested, is to get a good algorithm.  Python can be very helpful with that.  The standard <code>profile</code> module can help you find where the code is spending its time and you can focus your optimization on that part of the code.</p>

<p>As an intermediate step to a fully compiled language you can take a Python program and move it to Cython which compiles the Python to machine language.</p>

<p>If your profiling finds certain portions are the most heavily used and slowest then you can code just that portion in C and call it from Python.</p>

<p>I agree with @jonrsharpe: Use <code>itertools.chain()</code>.</p>

<p>The problem with the first two solutions…</p>

<pre><code>choice = sum( ( choices[i] for i in sequence ), [] )
choice = reduce( operator.add, ( choices[i] for i in sequence ) )
</code></pre>

<p>is that adding lists does not scale well, if <code>sequence</code> is long.</p>

<p>The third solution…</p>

<pre><code>choice = [ element for i in sequence for element in choices[i] ]
</code></pre>

<p>doesn't suffer from repeated copying like the first two.  However, it's less readable than the <code>itertools.chain</code> version.</p>

<p>Indeed iterating through all the rows is slowing down your code. But what about letting Excel do the work for you by using a formula?</p>

<p>This is what I suggest:</p>

<pre><code>Sub DupValidation()
Dim wb As Workbook
Dim ws1 As Worksheet

Dim i As Long
Dim lastrow As Long
Dim lastrow2 As Long

Set wb = ActiveWorkbook
Set ws1 = wb.Worksheets("Tickets")

lastrow = ws1.Cells(Rows.Count, 1).End(xlUp).Row


With ws1.Range("g2:g" &amp; lastrow)
    .ClearContents
    .FormulaR1C1 = "=IF(COUNTIF(R2C2:RC[-5],RC[-5])&gt;2,TRUE,"""")"
    .FormulaR1C1 = .Value2 ' To get rid off the formula
End With
End Sub
</code></pre>
    </div>

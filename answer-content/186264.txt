<p>This is a simple task for <em>conditional aggregation</em> using CASEs:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
  COUNT(*) AS total,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN CODE_A BETWEEN 100 AND 199 THEN 1 END) AS code_a_low_count,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN CODE_A BETWEEN 200 AND 299 THEN 1 END) AS code_a_high_count,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN CODE_B BETWEEN 100 AND 199 THEN 1 END) AS code_b_low_count,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN CODE_B BETWEEN 200 AND 299 THEN 1 END) AS code_b_high_count,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN CODE_C BETWEEN 100 AND 199 THEN 1 END) AS code_c_count
FROM table_one
WHERE date=myDate AND name=myName
</code></pre>

<p>As you're COUNTing you can return anything (besides NULL) in THEN.</p>

<p>This can also be written as a SUM over 1/0:</p>

<pre><code>SUM(CASE WHEN CODE_A BETWEEN 100 AND 199 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
</code></pre>
    </div>

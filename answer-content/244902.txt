<h2>Set membership</h2>
<pre><code>valid_clubs = []
with open("validclubs.txt") as f:
    for line in f:
        valid_clubs.append(line)
</code></pre>
<p>should be</p>
<pre><code>with open("validclubs.txt") as f:
    valid_clubs = {line.strip() for line in f}
</code></pre>
<p>Lines coming back from a file handle in Python include their line ending, which you have to strip yourself; and you should be using a set, not a list. Set membership lookups will be much faster than list lookups.</p>
<h2>Consider <code>DictReader</code></h2>
<p>The <code>csv</code> module has a reader that gives you back a dictionary based on the headings, so that you do not have to write <code>row[0]</code>, but rather <code>row['Category']</code>.</p>
<h2>Use <code>Counter</code></h2>
<p>Your list of category <code>ifs</code> can be condensed to a one-liner; read about <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Counter</a>. This will be easier to use and perform better.</p>
<h2>Empty rows</h2>
<p>Based on <code># ignore errors where row is empty</code>, this should be done up-front. Rather than hitting your face on an <code>IndexError</code> and having to ignore it, simply check for an empty row:</p>
<pre><code>if row:
</code></pre>

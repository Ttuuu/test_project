<p>Some comments beyond what others have said</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Your comments are useless. </p>

<pre><code># Login
def login():
</code></pre>

<p>tells you nothing. The name of the function is already <code>login</code>. </p>

<p>You're better off writing comments for blocks of code, particularly those that are not obvious from a first read, or for which a reader might ask, "why does this code do this?". The comments should be in plain English (read: complete sentences), and shouldn't insult the reader's intelligence. </p></li>
<li><p>Don't use <code>input</code> to read passwords. Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/getpass.html" rel="nofollow">getpass</a>, like</p>

<p>password = getpass.getpass()</p>

<p>(and put <code>import getpass</code> at the top of the file). This will read the password without echoing the characters to the terminal, so that if someone else is looking over the shoulder of the person typing they won't be able to see the password on the screen. </p></li>
<li><p>Add some empty space between logical blocks of code. As a simple example, <code>sendmail</code> is easier to read as </p>

<pre><code>def sendmail(username):
while True:
    recipient = input("Recipient &gt; ")
    if not len(recipient) &gt; 0:
        print("Recipient can't be blank")
        continue
    elif recipient not in users:
        print("There is no account with that username")
        continue
    else:
        break

while True:
    subject = input("Subject &gt; ")
    if not len(subject) &gt; 0:
        print("Subject can't be blank")
        continue
    else:
        break

while True:
    context = input("Context &gt; ")
    if not len(context) &gt; 0:
        print("Context can't be blank")
    else:
        break

print("Sending mail...")
users[recipient]["mail"].append(["Sender: " + username, "Subject: " + subject, "Context: " + context])
time.sleep(1)
print("Mail has been sent to " + recipient)
</code></pre>

<p>(along with the suggested changes from the other answers here of course).</p></li>
<li><p>Be consistent with your user prompts. Some use <code>:</code> and some use <code>&gt;</code>. </p></li>
<li><p>Why are you calling <code>time.sleep</code>? It seems to be unnecessary, and only serves to slow down the program. </p></li>
</ul>

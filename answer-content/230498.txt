<p>Not too much to review as the code uses <code>evhttp</code> to handle HTTP and provide a basic, static reply for each request.</p>

<p>Why is <code>host</code> <code>constexpr</code>, but not the <code>port</code>?</p>

<p>All those <code>using</code> statements, combined with traits and <code>decltype</code> one after the other makes the code very hard to read, almost obscuring the fact that <code>evhttp</code> is being initialized at that point. I would try to rewrite that part in a simpler way.</p>

<p>Why <code>auto main() -&gt; int</code> instead of the simple, classic <code>int main()</code>?</p>

<p>I get the feeling you just want to call the setters in a chain to spare you from writing <code>item.</code> and <code>;</code> before and after every call, instead of actually having a <em>fluent</em> interface.</p>

<p>Does this actually make your code more fluent and more maintainable or are you introducing foreign concepts that confuse the people who read it the future? Will you even remember what that code does in 6 months?</p>

<p>I would say that your gut feeling is right here. You're jumping through hoops to not make much of an improvement.</p>

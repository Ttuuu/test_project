  <p>I just want to know if the code I wrote would be appropriate in a interview setting or would I expect to write code like the solution in the book.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As we cannot see the solution form the book, this is hard for us to answer.</p>

<p>Your solution seems to work which is ok for learning purposes, the biggest I can think of with your current code is <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0202/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">List comprehension</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>for col in the_array:
    transposed.append(col[i])
transposed.reverse()
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Could be </p>

<pre><code>transposed = [col[i] for col in the_array][::-1]
</code></pre>

<p><em>Note how instead of <code>.reverse()</code> I use the slice annotation to reverse the list <code>[::-1]</code></em></p>

<p>We could even make the first for loop another list comprehension (essentially creating a double list comprehension)</p>

<pre><code>def transpose2(the_array):
    return [
        [col[i] for col in the_array][::-1]
        for i in range(len(the_array))
    ]
</code></pre>

<p>I should note though that is is a rather elaborate way of writing</p>

<pre><code>def transpose3(arr):
    return zip(*arr[::-1])
</code></pre>

<p>Where the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>zip</code></a> rotates the reversed list with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#unpacking-argument-lists" rel="nofollow noreferrer">argument unpacking</a></p>

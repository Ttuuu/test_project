<p>The main thing which can be recognized as a Junior Developer code is a poor possibility of code support in the future. 
To archive such a point you need to use some common architectural patterns. First of all the code should be tested and error handled.
Also, you were asked to provide SOLID code which again means a bunch of patterns (IoC as DI is a must today in the development cycle). For example, the Loader class is not SOLID at all. Try to use microservices architecture for this purpose. 
Also, I can see a strange code like:</p>

<pre><code>return _schedules.Where(s =&gt; s.Value.Loaded == false)
                        .ToDictionary(dict =&gt; dict.Key, dict =&gt; dict.Value);
</code></pre>

<p>I mean why this:</p>

<pre><code>s.Value.Loaded == false
</code></pre>

<p>and not just </p>

<pre><code>s=&gt;!s.Value.Loaded
</code></pre>

<p>Actually, after this row of code, I would decline your candidature for the Middle developer role. </p>

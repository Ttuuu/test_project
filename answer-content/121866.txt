<p><code>prime_factors</code> never calls <code>is_prime</code> with a number that's divisible by 2 or 3. <code>is_prime</code> could be faster if it used this knowledge. However, if <code>is_prime</code> will use this knowledge, then it may be a bit misleading in global scope. So you could move the definition of <code>is_prime</code> inside of <code>prime_factors</code>.</p>

<p>Although the code is Pythonic alright, it would be more idiomatic to use a prime generator to get the next prime factor, instead of iterating from 5 upwards. Given a prime generator <code>gen</code>, the final loop of the code would become:</p>

<pre><code>while n != 1:
    prime = next(gen)
    while not n % prime:
        prime_factor_list.append(prime)
        n //= prime
</code></pre>

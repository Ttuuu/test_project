<h2>Don't call your function <code>rm</code></h2>
<p>If you start depending on this safety net, you'll eventually have an accident on a system with a standard <code>rm</code> (e.g. when you become root and find yourself using <code>dash</code> for admin tasks).</p>
<p>I'd suggest</p>
<pre><code>weijun_rm() {
    # your safer implementation
}

rm() {
     echo "Disabled - please use weijun_rm instead" &gt;&amp;2
     return 1
}
</code></pre>
<p>This will train you not to use <code>rm</code> for deleting files.  When your function isn't available and you have to use the real <code>rm</code>, you will be on alert and extra careful to check the arguments.</p>

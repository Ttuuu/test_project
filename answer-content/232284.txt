<p>Your main bottleneck is, of course, using the console for drawing the frame.
I suggest you to stop using <code>std::endl</code> in your <code>Display()</code> function, and write a new line character instead.</p>

<p>I believe this only helps you, though, if you turn off automatic flushing using<code>std::ios::sync_with_stdio</code>. You have to see yourself if this is an improvement on your machine anyway.</p>

<p><em>Actually there are other problems I see in this code you should care about; quality, and not performance-wise. But I wouldn't address those now, since you didn't ask for it.</em></p>

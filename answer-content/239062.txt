<p>Just few small points.</p>

<p>You can use <code>std::array</code>.</p>

<p>You can have the size represent half of the entire diameter. Thus having <code>nArray&lt;T, 50&gt;</code> allocate memory for indices -50 to 50 and avoid the odd size check.</p>

<p>You might also reconsider if you really need <code>[][]</code> access and whether it wouldnt be better to implement a class that has just 1d array to represent 2d matrix and offer access through a member method <code>at(x, y)</code>. Or if you have a point like structure you could have something like <code>operator[](const point &amp; p)</code>.</p>

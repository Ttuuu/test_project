<p>I hope you realize these things:</p>

<ol>
<li>You are using r as the offset of the top-left from the origin.</li>
<li>You are using same length for width and height - so square</li>
<li>Length should be 2*r rather than 2r (guessing you made it +1 to make the loop work)</li>
<li>Your i should go from 0 to &lt;=length. It should be inclusive range as you want to include both borders.</li>
</ol>

<p>In other words, length = 2r.
And for loop goes from i=0 to i&lt;=length.</p>

<p>What do I mean by offset? The top-left corner will always be offset by (-r,-r) relative to the axes origin. As the length changes, only the bottom right corner will keep moving.</p>

<p>For example, if length is changed to length = 4r, then top-left corner will remain at (-r,-r) and bottom-right corner will move to (3r, 3r).</p>

<p>Here (+) represents the origin, and it is not at the center of the bigger square.</p>

<p>You can better keep r=0, or remove the variable r completely, and just use length = 10. Then your square will start at (0,0) and go to (l, l).</p>

<p>If you want it to be a rectangle, you can use width and height instead of the common length.</p>

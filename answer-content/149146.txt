<p>Problem 1 is probably better and more pythonic when written as a list comprehension:</p>

<pre><code>x = sum(i for i in range(1000) if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0)
print(x)
</code></pre>

<p>For the second problem I would recommend a generator and to use <code>sum</code> again:</p>

<pre><code>def fibonacci(max_n):
    n, prev = 1, 1
    while n &lt;= max_n:
        yield n
        n, prev = n + prev, n

total = sum(n for n in fibonacci(4000000) if n % 2 == 0)
print(total)
</code></pre>

<p>This way only two ints are ever in memory (well three if you count <code>max_n</code>). In comparison, your code has a list of possibly large size.</p>

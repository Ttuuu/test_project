  <p>[...] I am not sure if the operator[] is done correctly: should I be using the has_key function?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is done correctly (i.e. it does what the contract of its API should), but not efficiently. The operator iterates twice (once in <code>has_key</code> and once in the operator). You can replace both calls with a call to <code>std::find_if</code>, and remove the <code>has_key</code> function completely.</p>

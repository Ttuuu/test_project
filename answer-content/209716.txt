<h3>Exception handling</h3>

<p>Throwing <code>Exception</code> is not recommended because it's too generic.
It doesn't give a clue to the caller as to what went wrong.
It's recommended to use specific exceptions.</p>

<p>When implementing a collection abstract data type, it's good to take a look at a similar interface in the standard library, for example <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Deque.html#addFirst(E)" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Deque</code></a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>How do they handle when an element cannot be added due to capacity restrictions? They throw <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>.</li>
<li>How do they handle when an element is requested but the collection is empty? They throw <code>NoSuchElementException</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>As you see, suitable specific exceptions already exist.
Also notice that these exceptions are <em>unchecked</em>.
It means that callers of these methods don't have to catch them.
And that seems an appropriate decision,
since the situations in which these exceptions can be thrown are quite unexpected, and should not happen under normal circumstances.</p>

<h3>Redundant <code>capacity</code> variable</h3>

<p>The member variable <code>capacity</code> is redundant.
The same information already exists in <code>elements.length</code>.</p>

<h3>Make members <code>final</code> when possible</h3>

<p>Since <code>elements</code> is never reassigned, it would be good to make it <code>final</code>,
so that you cannot reassign by mistake.</p>

<h3>Overriding <code>toString</code></h3>

<p>Keep in mind that <code>toString</code> is not intended for "pretty-printing".</p>

<p>And for printing the content of the heap,
this implementation doesn't look useful to me.
With the <code>null</code> values removed,
the structure of the heap is not visible,
and without the structure, the ordering of the elements is meaningless,
which can be misleading.</p>

<p>For printing the content of the heap I would suggest adding a dedicated method,
keep the <code>null</code>s, and print values of the first <code>size</code> elements.</p>

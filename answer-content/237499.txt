<p>In addition, I'd recommend using a for loop instead of a while loop here just so that it's more clear what's going on. And I'd put the entire for loop in a function so you could do something like</p>

<pre><code>if isPrime(pr):
    print(pr, " is a prime number.")
else:
    print(pr, " is not a prime number.")
</code></pre>

<p>This will also make it so you can use return() instead of exit() as specified in the other answer:</p>

<pre><code>def isPrime(pr):
    for i in range(2, pr):
        if pr % i == 0:
            return(True)
    return(False)
</code></pre>

<p>Also as already stated name your variables properly.</p>

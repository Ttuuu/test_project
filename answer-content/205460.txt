<p>If you take a step back from code and look at the bigger picture, nobody actually reads 100k table rows in one session. It would be 100 rows at best, then people start skimming. At that point, all the effort of rendering is for nothing.</p>

<p>One good example of this is Google. When you search for a term, it can return millions of matches. However, Google only renders <em>the first 10</em> and paginates the rest away. Another would be log aggregation platforms like <a href="https://www.scalyr.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Scalyr</a> or <a href="https://sentry.io/about/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Sentry</a>. Logs can be hundreds of megabytes worth of log messages, but it only renders the first hundred or so. The rest you can reach via search filters, sorts and pagination. </p>

<p>So my advice would be to render only a limited subset at a time. At the same time move your focus towards implementing search capabilities. You might want to look into <a href="https://lunrjs.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Lunr</a> for client-side search indexing capabilities.</p>

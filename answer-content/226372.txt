<p>Ok, first some comments.  I’ll add code if you want - just can’t do it effectively from my phone.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Basically any string function that doesn’t take the length of the string is problematic.  It has the potential to read beyond the end of the buffer.  atoi should be replaced with strtol, strcmp with strncmp, ...</p>

<ol start="2">
<li>Allocating fixed sizes of memory, just to release the fixed sizes of memory is pointless.  Don’t do that.  Now having the allocation and the free in the same function is very beneficial, do that over allocating something buried in a function and remembering to deallocate it later.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The standard string library is very slow.  It is ok for very simple things, as long as you only need to do them once.  If you need to do this faster, you might want to use a tool like lex or flex to do so.  You can also write your own lexical scanner based on deterministic automata - it’s a good exercise, but flex is much easier.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Ok, I’ll have to fix my formatting later.</p>

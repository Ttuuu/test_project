<p>Your indentation is very inconsistent.  Pick a number of spaces for indentation and stick with it.</p>

<p><strong>Hopfield.h</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>You're using some C libraries (<code>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;math.h&gt;</code>) in C++.  They should respectively be <code>&lt;cstdio&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;cmath&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>You may also remove both of them as they don't appear to be in use.</p>

<p>Lastly, you should move <code>&lt;iostream&gt;</code> to the .cpp file since it's not used in the header.  In general, header files should have as few links as possible because other files dependent on them and may be affected by them and break.</p></li>
<li><p>In <code>Hopfield_neuron</code>, it looks like you should have <code>private</code> instead of <code>protected</code>.  The latter would only be needed if another class were to inherit from it.  Also, <code>weight</code> should not be <code>public</code> as it's a data member.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Hopfield_network</code> shouldn't be entirely <code>public</code>.  The first three data members should be <code>private</code> while the member functions can stay <code>public</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>main.cpp</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Do not use <code>void</code> as <code>main()</code>'s return type.  It may be allowed by some non-compliant compilers, but it's still considered non-standard.  It should only return <code>int</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>You use the "magic number" 4 for your array bounds.  You could consider making it a constant so that its meaning is given.  This would also allow you to make changes in just one area if you ever need to modify this value.</p></li>
<li><p><code>threshold()</code> can just use a single-line ternary statement:</p>

<pre><code>return (k &gt;= 0) ? 1 : 0;
</code></pre>

<p>You should also make it <code>const</code> since it doesn't modify any data members:</p>

<pre><code>int Hopfield_network::threshold(int k) const {}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Remove that excess whitespace from the end of the <code>Hopfield_network()</code> parameter line:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>Hopfield_network::Hopfield_network(int nrn0[4], int nrn1[4], int nrn2[4],        int nrn3[4])
</code></pre>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Use storage containers such as <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector" rel="noreferrer"><code>std::vector</code></a> in place of C-style arrays.  The latter should not be used in C++ if at all possible.  One reason is because passing them to functions causes them to decay to pointers.  This is already happening in many of your functions.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider putting each statement in the <code>switch</code> as separate lines.  This could help with readability and with preventing horizontal line character counts from increasing.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I won't read this code beginning to end. Some basic advice:</p>

<h2>Namespaces</h2>

<p><code>ExperimentSimpleBkLibInvTool.ModelInMVC.DictionaryTabelBaseModel</code> doesn't follow naming conventions. 
Naming convention is <code>Company.App.Module</code>. 
It should be something like: <code>Pacmaninbw.PersonalLibrary.Model</code>.</p>

<h2>Naming</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Don't tack on crap affixes to the names. </p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>ExperimentSimple...</code> 
It's ok to write experimentally low quality code. 
But stating the experimentality of the code belongs to README.md. 
Putting it in the name makes it even lower quality. 
If you are worried people will use your code to operate Nuclear Reactors and Airliners put legal discalimers in the LICENCE.txt.</p></li>
<li><p><code>...Tool</code> 
It's either a "library" or a "book inventory", but never a "book library inventory tool", much less "bk lib inv tool". 
You can say "screwdriver" or "hammer", but never "nail driver hammer tool".</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Don't repeat pattern artifacts in names (<code>ModelInMVC</code>)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you are following a well-known pattern no need to mangle names to advertise it.
When you are following patterns follow the naming conventions in the examples.
If you, for some reason, are writing a singleton, add an <code>Instance</code> property. 
Don't name the property <code>TheSingletonInstance</code>.
If you put <code>Models</code>, <code>Views</code>, <code>Controllers</code> folders people will understand you are following a pattern, especially if it is the IDE default. 
If you are following an obscure pattern, document it with the sources where others can learn about it and the reasons you chose it in the README.</p>

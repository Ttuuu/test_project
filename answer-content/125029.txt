<p>Your best fit for this issue is to use the (relatively) new guy in town : the <code>Set</code>, that will do the job for you of ignoring duplicate.<br>
Most browsers support it now, and i looked a few jsperf and it is already fast. 
The <code>Set</code> is especially interesting if you have many duplicates. </p>

<p>Edit : i changed my code for the more efficient code of @juvian, thks to him for his update.</p>

<pre><code>function diffArray(arr1, arr2) {
   var set1 = new Set(arr1);
   var set2 = new Set(arr2);

   var arr = []   

   set1.forEach(function(val) {  
     if (!set2.has(val)) arr.push(val); 
   });
   set2.forEach(function(val) {  
     if (!set1.has(val)) arr.push(val); 
   });

   return arr;
}
</code></pre>

<p>( Notice that if performance matters you'll want to create only once those 4 <code>Set</code> and only <code>clear()</code> them before use ).  </p>

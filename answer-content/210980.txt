<h2>Reconsider <code>ansi</code></h2>

<p><code>-ansi</code> is equivalent to C89, which is many versions behind the current standard (C99 -&gt; C11 -&gt; C17). C99 is popular and will buy you some great language features. C17 is supported by gcc, though, so you should use that.</p>

<h2>Clean up your whitespace</h2>

<p>You should add one or two blank lines between each of your functions.</p>

<p>Your tabs are non-uniform - they seem to vary between two and three spaces. Generally 3-4 spaces is standard; choose a standard and apply it with an IDE or advanced text editor.</p>

<h2>Use <code>const</code></h2>

<p><code>printMat</code> does not modify <code>mat</code>, so declare it <code>const</code>.</p>

<h2>Don't double-initialize</h2>

<p>@Edward correctly indicated that variable declarations should be pulled into the loop. One other thing: you initialize <code>i=0</code> twice, so the first one has no effect. The <code>j=0</code> will also have no effect. Avoid doing effect-less assignment.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Allowing spaces in usernames and passwords represents absolutely no security risk -- so let your users do it if they like. Well, if you don't want usernames to have spaces, that's a person choice. In fact, by silently removing spaces, you stand the chance of irritating your users because they will struggle to log in if the saved username or password doesn't match what they [thought they] typed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I don't see any reason to save a blank username string to the <code>$_SESSION</code> array.  If you are going to save the username to the SESSION, then only added it after it is validated.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Because your script can only produce a single error message,  then it could be argued that employing an array to contain this data is an overly complex data structure.  Unless you plan on extending the volume of error messages to be displayed to the user, just save the variable as a string.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Never display <code>mysqli_error()</code> messages in production code.  You never want to give bad-actors any "useful" information.</p>
</li>

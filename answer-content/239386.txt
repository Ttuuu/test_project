<p>There are a couple of ways to do this.  I thought using <code>deque()</code> like the original code would be slow, but it is actually faster than most I tried.  For reasonable window sizes the code below runs in 2/3 the time. In some tests with large windows (&gt;= 100), it was slower, but not always.</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import islice, tee

def sliding_window_iter4(iterable, size):
    iterables = tee(iter(iterable), size)
    window = zip(*(islice(t, n, None) for n,t in enumerate(iterables)))
    yield from window
</code></pre>

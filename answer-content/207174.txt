<p>As a general rule of thumb, any time you feel the need to use <code>goto</code>, take a couple of aspirin and lay down until the feeling passes.  They probably should have been deprecated decades ago.</p>

<p>In this particular case, using a string of allowed characters and randomly picking an index in that string would do away with your goto's.</p>

<p>I think too a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.stringbuilder" rel="noreferrer"><code>StringBuilder</code></a> would do a lot better for storing the characters than a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.linkedlist-1" rel="noreferrer"><code>LinkedList</code></a>.</p>

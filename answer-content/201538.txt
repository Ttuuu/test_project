<p>Well, interesting.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There's a bug in <code>merge_sort()</code>: Subtracting <code>1</code> from <code>end</code>, without knowing whether the range is empty, is Undefined Behavior. Subtract the iterators and compare the difference instead. While you are at it, use <code>std::distance</code> for that.</p></li>
<li><p>There's no need to move the second half out of the way in <code>sub_merge()</code>: You are merging from the front, and the first half fits in the first half of the range.</p></li>
<li><p>Allocating memory is expensive. Consider whether you can't do one allocation in the public function, and pass it through to the helpers as needed.</p></li>
<li><p>Also consider whether you wouldn't prefer your ordering stable. It doesn't cost anything but being careful with the merge. Currently, you prefer the second range where you should prefer the first.</p></li>
<li><p>Use prefix operators over postfix operators, unless you really need the copy of the old value. The clarity of intent and occasional increased efficiency shouldn't be rejected.</p></li>

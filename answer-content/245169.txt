<p>You only need one instance of <code>Random</code> and <code>Scanner</code> for the whole programm. Especially creating new instances of <code>Scanner</code> is bad, because it locks resources, that you never free by closing it.</p>
<p>For the <code>switch</code> you are unnecessarily using the new expression syntax which is used when you want to return a value which you don't. The more conventional syntax would be:</p>
<pre><code>switch (player) {
  case "s", "S", "shoot", "Shoot", "SHOOT":
    System.out.println(shoot[shot] + "\n");
    break;
  default:
    System.out.println("SHOOT THE BALL PROPERLY.\n");
    break;
}
</code></pre>
    </div>

<p>This really isn't bad, in terms of base Python. The only thing that stands out to me is this:</p>

<pre><code>first_row = [row for row in reader(open('genre_scores.csv', 'r'))][0]
</code></pre>

<p>Firstly, you aren't closing the file. Always close the file after you're done.</p>

<p><code>'r'</code> is implicit, so you don't need to write it in the arguments to <code>open</code>.</p>

<p>Also, you're building up an entire list in memory from the CSV file, and then throwing it all away only to use the first row. Instead, you should use something like:</p>

<pre><code>with open('genre_scores.csv') as f:
    csv_reader = reader(f)
    first_row = next(csv_reader)
</code></pre>

<p>You also ask:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'd like to implement something that makes sure that lst isn't longer than three elements (since four dimensional plots aren't really a thing). The only way I know to do this is <code>assert len(lst) &lt;=3</code>, which gets the job done but it would be nice if it also could raise a useful error message. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fairly straightforward, and I'll also assume that the minimum is 2:</p>

<pre><code>if not (2 &lt;= len(lst) &lt;= 3):
    raise ValueError(f'Invalid lst length of {len(lst)}')
</code></pre>

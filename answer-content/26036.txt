<p>Another thing I would suggest is to try using boolean values without the <code>==</code> operator. As you write more complex expressions, you'll find that to check the value of a boolean to either 'true' or 'false' is a redundant step. For example, your code could be changed to this:</p>

<pre><code>if ( !seating[count] )  // if false, then a seat is available for assignment... Notice the use of the negation operator instead of == false
        {
            seating[count] = true;  // assign seat
            System.out.printf("First Class. Seat# %d\n", count);
            break;
        }
        else if ( seating[5] ) // If seating[5] is true then first class is fully booked
        {
            if ( seating[10] )
</code></pre>
    </div>

<p>When looking at code like this, the first thing that comes to mind is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Single Responsibility Principle</a> Every function module should be responsible for doing one thing. </p>

<p>In this case, you can start with <code>main</code> calling the function that starts the program.</p>

<p>You can have the string literals that you want to print to the screen as string arrays and a function that prints a string array to the screen.</p>

<p>Parsing the choices is easier, when done with a <code>switch</code> block.</p>

<p>Each choice should also call a function specific to that choice.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/articles/j3wTURfi/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Get out of the habit of using <code>system()</code></a>.  It is very insecure since there is no way to confirm that the called function will do what you expect on every machine.</p>

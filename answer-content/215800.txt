<p>If you split things out into (ideally) classes or at least functions, you can have cleaner code as well as reuse things on different pages or in different functions or classes. For example see the refactor of your if/else checking for a valid password:</p>

<p>While this code should work, it's not tested, so please don't use in production without usual considerations and testing.</p>

<pre><code>function getPasswordError($password, $confirm_password)
{
    $password_filter1 = '/(?=.*[A-Z])/m';
    $password_filter2 = '/(?=.*\d)/m';   

    if (empty($password) || empty($confirm_password)) {
        return 'You must enter a password';
    }

    if (strlen($password) &lt; 6) {
        return 'Your password must be at least 6 characters long';
    }

    if ($password !== $confirm_password) {
        return 'The passwords do not match';
    }

    if (!preg_match($password_filter1, $password)) {
        return 'Your password must have at least 1 capital letter';
    }

    if (!preg_match($password_filter2, $password)) {
        return 'Your password must contain at least 1 number';
    }

    return false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can check it such as:</p>

<pre><code>$password_error = getPasswordError($password, $confirm_password);

if ($password_error !== false) {
    echo $password_error; // or do whatever with the data
}    
</code></pre>

<p>The thing about that function is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Cleaner, easier to read and see what errors would be issued</li>
<li>Easier to add, remove, or alter conditions</li>
<li>Reusable - if in a separate file somewhere then the function can be used in other places (eg the login form and registration as both need the same validation)</li>
<li>Return early (as soon as something fails etc go back)</li>
</ol>

<p>Note: That I've put your filters inside the function. You could pass them in, and will in some functions to have control, but likely you wouldn't want to ever have different criteria for those filters. That would (likely) be a different function for a different purpose (even if the same conditions).</p>

<p>Also the function could be better named, but given your other code there's not much to do. E.g. I would have a function that determined if valid or not and just returned bools, then if something failed then issue a specific message.</p>

<p>I see two improvement points in the code.</p>

<ol>
<li>It is better to use getLine() and store the input in char* instead of reading each char and appending to a stack</li>
<li>It is more than enough to iterate till half of the string as the remaining half is checked in the first half iteration <code>cstack.top() != cqueue.front()</code></li>
</ol>
    </div>

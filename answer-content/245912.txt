<p>According to information you provided it's not necessary to wrap it with lock.</p>
<p>Let's consider situation you described. You wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There will be multiple threads instantiating this class</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there will be one instance for each thread. There's no synchronisation needed, because only one thread will be accessing your class at a time.</p>
<p>Other scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li>Single instance of MyDataProvider class is shared between multiple threads. What does it mean? GetItem() method could be invoked by multiple threads at the same time. In that case you'll need synchronization <strong>IF</strong> your class have any state that (private field for example) could be accessed and modified from GetItem() method. You don't have such situation, so synchronization is not needed. Also you get connection from '<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql-server-connection-pooling?redirectedfrom=MSDN" rel="noreferrer">[POOL]</a>' each time anyone is invoking GetItem() instance method.</li>
<li>Single instance of MyDataProvider class is shared between multiple threads <strong>AND</strong> sqlconnection is a state in it. Then you would need to synchronize it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your implementation should be fine.</p>

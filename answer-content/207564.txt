<p>Nothing about code review, I am here to explain my hypothesis that this is not a good algorithm for "Dungon Map" as it can't generate random enough rooms</p>

<p>So from your algo</p>

<pre><code>def _split(self, leaf):
    if leaf.width / leaf.height &gt;= self.split_threshold:
        return self._split_room(leaf, Split.HORIZONTAL)
    elif leaf.height / leaf.width &gt;= self.split_threshold:
        return self._split_room(leaf, Split.VERTICAL)
    else:
        return self._split_room(leaf, choice([Split.VERTICAL, Split.HORIZONTAL]))

def _split_room(self, leaf, direction):
    leaf_a = leaf_b = None
    if direction == Split.VERTICAL:
        if not leaf.height &lt; self.min_room_space * 2:
            ...
    elif direction == Split.HORIZONTAL:
        if not leaf.width &lt; self.min_room_space * 2:
            ...
    return leaf_a, leaf_b
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>split</strong> will <strong>stop</strong> when:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>leaf.height &lt; self.min_room_space * 2</code> or <code>leaf.width &lt; self.min_room_space * 2</code></p></li>
<li><p>And from <code>random_split = randint(leaf.lu.y + self.min_room_space, leaf.rd.y - self.min_room_space)</code> you've make sure that the room's width and heigh with at least <code>self.min_room_space</code> length</p></li>
<li><p><code>self.split_threshold</code> make sure width and height ratio, and whole space will be fully divided(no width/height longer than <code>min_room_space * 2</code>)</p></li>
<li><p>and no extra space between rooms</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So ultimately the whole space will be divided into rooms with width <code>self.min_room_space</code> to <code>self.min_room_space * 2</code> and same for height.</p>

<hr>

<h2>So how will it looks like</h2>

<p>Suppose I have <code>room 1</code> and <code>room 2</code> on the top now, looks like this and ready to add <code>room 3</code>, below <code>room 1</code>, on the top left of the whole space. And what's <code>room 3</code>'s width, <strong>can only be the same as <code>room 1</code></strong></p>

<p>Because no matter when <code>room 3</code> width larger or smaller than <code>room 1</code>, there is 
no possible to fill the "height gap" between <code>room 1</code> and <code>room 2</code>, as the height difference between is smaller than <code>min_room_space</code></p>

<p>You might also find, these small rooms always try to be a "big box" together</p>

<p>So these are rooms with not to much difference in width and height, (the difference be smaller with smaller <code>min_room_space</code>) and try to be "big box" together all the time, I think they are well organized rooms</p>

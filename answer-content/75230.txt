<p>This is really pretty good. 
I would do a few things slightly differently.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Don't use globals. Pass the $mysqli parameter into your function. Globals cause nightmares for maintainers.</p></li>
<li><p>Do an explicit error check after each mysqli method invocation, and get rid of the cascading if statements. Check for a false return, then issue a message.  In your logic you might also emit the error message and then return <code>false</code>. But you need to announce the error somehow or other or you'll have trouble debugging things.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For example: (Note, using <code>die</code> is a little sloppy, but not as bad as failing to report errors.) </p>

<pre><code> $stmt = $mysqli-&gt;prepare( 'SELECT name FROM `payment_methods` WHERE id = ?' );
 if ($stmt === false) {
         die "prepare failed:" . mysqli_connect_error();

 }
</code></pre>
    </div>

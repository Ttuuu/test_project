<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>N is an integer within the range <code>[1..100,000]</code>;
each element of array A is an integer within the range <code>[1..1,000,000,000]</code>.</p>

<p>So, who said that you will have a disordered sequence of 1, 2, 3, 4...
You might get <code>N = 6</code>, and array <code>A[1, 4, 5, 7, 1000, 6]</code>.</p>

<p>So, your solutions are wrong.
I suggest you to use <code>HashTable</code> to store a value and check if it has one or not.</p>

<p>A few things I noticed:</p>

<ul>
<li>You have a double include of <code>sys/stat.h</code></li>
<li>When checking through value of <code>argc</code>, instead of saying “Something wrong with variables”, it would be better to print a notice that the user gave the wrong number of arguments, along with a small usage statement. There’s also an error code for that case, I believe.</li>
<li>You set the file size variables as an <code>int</code>, but I would bet that <code>st_size</code> returns a <code>size_t</code> or at least an unsigned value, I’d suggest checking the man page and changing that declaration </li>
<li>In the conditional branch where the file sizes are different is followed, it might be nice to print a message saying that the file sizes are different </li>
<li>Many of the functions you call( <code>stat</code>, <code>fopen</code>,etc...) set <code>errno</code> on failure. It might be nice if when you handle those errors, you printed out the error with <code>strerror(errno)</code> so the user has a better understanding of the error (make sure to include <code>errno.h</code>)</li>
<li>At the end of your program, it is assumed the files are equal, change <code>return 2</code> to <code>return EXIT_SUCCESS</code></li>
<li>None of these are fatal, but worth considering for quality.</li>
</ul>

<p>So now that I have torn apart your code:
It looks good, the formatting was clear for me to read. I couldn’t detect anything concerning other than what was listed. The best thing I can think to do moving on would be to run <code>valgrind</code> on it, run through it with a debugger and do a bunch of tests.</p>

<p>I must say it a very interesting assignment to do:
what I see missing from your assignment is not much bigger things in development aspects but it all have a huge impact on Code maintainability and infrastructure cost sometimes:</p>

<ul>
<li>your code is not modularized, from the first sight i can see that you should have maintained the Postgres connection-related configuration in another file with its associated getter and setter functions same for creation of etherscan instance.</li>
<li>There should be separate module for app entry point where you will create/ listen server through express and another for app routes.</li>
<li>There should be any logging module used like winston, pino, morgon.</li>
<li>Looking at your addAddress function, i see you are triggering multiple insert queries (one for every transaction), which can be accomplised by only a single query using bulk insert operations.</li>
<li>avoid using var type variables if the values if the variable is not going to be changed.</li>
</ul>

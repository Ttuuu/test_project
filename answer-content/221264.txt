<p>Answering my own question, this might even run quicker than accepted solution:</p>

<pre><code>If lastrow_s &gt; 7 Then

Set copyrng = lo_b1.AutoFilter.Range.SpecialCells(xlCellTypeVisible)
copyrng.Copy Destination:=strng
arr = strng.CurrentRegion.Offset(1, 0)
aRws = Evaluate("Row(1:" &amp; UBound(arr) &amp; ")")
arr = Application.Index(arr, aRws, Array(14, 1, 6, 2, 13, 12, 18, 16, 7))

With strng.CurrentRegion
.ClearContents
.Interior.Color = xlNone
.Borders.LineStyle = xlNone
End With

pasterange1.Resize(UBound(arr, 1), UBound(arr, 2)).Value = arr

Set copyrng = Nothing
Erase arr
Erase aRws
lo_b1.AutoFilter.ShowAllData
End If
</code></pre>

<p>What this does:</p>

<ol>
<li>copies the auto-filtered range to a temp location</li>
<li>an array is created from the temp data</li>
<li>the array is evaluated and only columns of interest are maintained in preferred order</li>
<li>the array is pasted in desired location</li>
</ol>

<p>The only problem I am having is that dates are pasted as text, and cannot be filtered as dates in new location. If you have any ideas on how to fix that without looping please let me know.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What do you think about my implementation? Is is done in a basically correct way?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah who is to say what is "correct"? I mostly have worked with the <a href="https://www.chaijs.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">chaiJS</a> <a href="https://www.chaijs.com/plugins/chai-spies/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">spies API</a> and it feels like a basic version of that library. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm I using the ES6-features (Classes, Rest, Spread) right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While there isn't much to the code, I would say it looks like those features are used correctly. You could consider using more class features like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get" rel="nofollow noreferrer">getters</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set" rel="nofollow noreferrer">setters</a></p>

<hr>

<p>In the constructor, there exists this line:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>this.result = null;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>but the <code>result</code> property doesn't appear to be used anywhere. What is that for?</p>

<p>There isn't a <em>whole</em> lot here to comment on. I'll just mention a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Technically</em>, from my quick search of what a powerset is, this function should return sets. That seems petty, but unless it's documented to return a lazy list of lazy lists, users may try to treat the "subsets" as sets (like using them as functions). I'd finish this function off by <code>map</code>ping <code>set</code> over the list.</p></li>
<li><p>But to do that, you should rename your parameter, as you're shadowing the build-in <code>set</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>After doing the above two, it developed quite long lines and became nested. I'd add in some use of <code>-&gt;&gt;</code>, and put a few of the lines on the next line.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>After that, I ended up with:</p>

<pre><code>(defn powerset [base-set]
  (-&gt;&gt; base-set
       (reduce
         (fn [xs x] 
           (concat xs
                   (map #(cons x %) xs)))
         [()])

       (map set)))
</code></pre>

<p>A short review;</p>

<ul>
<li>Changing CSS for <code>input</code> seems too broad, just apply CSS changes to a class tied to your control</li>
<li><code>throw new TypeError('Unknown geographic position type.');</code> seems odd, why throw this if the calling function does not catch it anyway? You need a think on how this control handles exceptions.</li>
<li>Similarly, in <code>degreesToDMS</code> you return <code>null</code> , but the calling functions don't deal with returned <code>null</code> values. You need a think about that as well.</li>
<li>Naming is well done</li>
<li>Commenting is well done</li>
<li>Design seems standard to me for a new control</li>
</ul>
    </div>

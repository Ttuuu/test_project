<p>Lo and behold, the power of PHP 7's <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/isset_ternary" rel="noreferrer">null coalesce operator!</a> It is also called the isset ternary operator, for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>Here's a passage from php.net's wiki page about it</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Proposal</strong></p>
<p>The coalesce, or ??, operator is added, which returns the result of its first operand if it exists and is not NULL, or else its second operand. This means the <code>$_GET['mykey'] ?? ""</code> is completely safe and will not raise an <code>E_NOTICE</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what it looks like</p>
<p><code>$survey_answers = $_POST['survey_questions'] ?? null;</code></p>
<p>It can even be chained. It'll use the first value that exists and isn't null, consider the following:</p>
<pre><code>$a = 11;
$b = null;
$c = 'test';

$d = $a ?? $b ?? $c;

print $d;
</code></pre>
<p>This would result in <code>11</code>, however if <code>$a = null;</code> it would print <code>test</code>.</p>

<p>I don't have enough reputation to add comments in this stack site. So I'll leave my thoughts in an answer.</p>

<p>Something that really caught my eye was that you are overloading Pythons print() function.
Sure you <strong>CAN</strong> do that, but <strong>SHOULD</strong> you do really do that? I get what you are trying to do, but I would just make a new function of it instead. Also, there are a lot of code that can break in there, I suggest some error handling.</p>

<p>Your drop_box and pick_up_box functions have a lot of returns, but none of them returns anything. I would have used 'elif' and a final 'else' instead.</p>

<p>The function 'fill_all' should be renamed to 'fill_all_stacks'.</p>

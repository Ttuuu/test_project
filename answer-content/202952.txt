<blockquote>
  <p>Is it guaranteed that viewDidLoad() will finish before viewWillAppear() is called? Will an even a larger data set be available for rendering as PDF in viewWillAppear()?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. It needs to be loaded before it will appear.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it acceptable to present modally from the UINavigationController?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it is.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should I be subclassing the main UINavigationController and using its prepare(for:sender:) method (if this is even an option)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It sounds a bit complicated. <code>prepare(for:sender:)</code> is not a very clean way to do transfer data to begin with and only useful when you use segues in a regular way. Why don't you create the <code>ModalViewController</code> in code, set the value and then push it through code instead?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the performSegue(withIdentifier:sender:) method, does the sender argument make any difference?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I used it in rare occasions to understand where the push was coming from.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it preferable to use present() rather than a segue?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think in your case yes.</p>

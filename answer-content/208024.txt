<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>Some suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li>You could get rid of the class and put the entire method contents within your <code>main</code> method; that'll at least get rid of an instantiation.</li>
<li>I'm not sure whether <code>'a'</code> is converted to an integer at compilation time or runtime. Try using 0x61 instead.</li>
<li>You can <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/11876086/96588">avoid converting to a char array</a>.</li>
</ul>

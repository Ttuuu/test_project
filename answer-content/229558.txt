<p>The core of your code can be replaced by the following code:</p>

<pre><code>url.openConnection()    //you can cast to fail if it isn't https
   .getInputStream()   //same as you
   .reader()          // same as wrapping it in inputStreamReader
   .use { it -&gt;      // start lambda that handles the closing of the reader for you
      it.readText() // note, it's one parameter, so 'it -&gt;' can be omitted
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The code above returns the text or throws the exception it got during execution, but always closes the reader, which in turn <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3956163/does-closing-the-inputstream-of-a-socket-also-close-the-socket-connection">closes the connection</a>.</p>

<p>The code above is almost the same as the code below btw:</p>

<pre><code>url.readText()
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to remove all the variables, you should know that try catch can return a value:</p>

<pre><code>val a = try{ 1 } catch(e: Exception) { 2 }
</code></pre>
    </div>

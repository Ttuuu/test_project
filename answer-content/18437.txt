<p>If the list is ordered like in your example you could do something like:</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; ints.size(); ++i) {
    if (i + 1 != ints.get(i)) {
        return i + 1;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The value will always be 1 more than the index (since you start at 1 and not 0) except for the missing number and the numbers that occur after it (which will be 2 ahead of the index). So you just return the first occurrence where it fails.</p>

<p>If the list is out of order, you could sort it first and then do the above.</p>

<p>Another option, which doesn't matter if the list is sorted or not, is to use sets. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6024934/finding-the-different-elements-between-two-arraylists-in-java">Explained here</a>. Although this is probably overkill for only 1 missing element.</p>

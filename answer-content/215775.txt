<p>At first, do you have a link do a working demo? It would be easier to examine the page. But I'll try to give some advice anyway.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you want your page to be fully responsive you should not use <code>px</code> as a unit for the properties <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>. <code>px</code> is an absolute unit. It would be better to use a relative unit such as <code>%</code>, <code>vh</code>, <code>vw</code>, <code>vmin</code>, <code>vmax</code>, <code>em</code> or <code>rem</code>. If you do that, your layout will be more fluid. I would recommend <code>%</code> on the <code>width</code> property and <code>vh</code> on the <code>height</code> property.</p></li>
<li><p>I am not sure why your layout depends so heavily on a height set on the divs. I rarely use <code>height</code> (and if I do it is almost always <code>vh</code>) because a container will expand to the height of its children e.g. text content. So if you maximize the screen and a container has a larger width (use % on width) it will take up less space because the text can spread over the width. I hope it's clear what I mean :D</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Hopefully this is helpful. If you could post a link to a demo version I'd like do have a second look on it.</p>

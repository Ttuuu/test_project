<h1>Style</h1>

<p>All the other answers are quite good and you should definitely follow their recommendations. They do however gloss over a stylistic point I find particularly striking about your code: blank lines.</p>

<p>The way you use them makes them almost obsolete. There would not be a major difference in the readability of your code if you left them out, since there are almost distributed uniformly in your code, and are therefore not helping to structure it.</p>

<p>Python comes with an official <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Style Guide for Python Code</a> (the infamous PEP8) and has clear guidelines on how to use vertical whitespace, aka blank lines to actually aid readability:</p>

<p>Quote from the section on <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#blank-lines" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Blank Lines</a> (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Surround <strong>top-level function</strong> and <strong>class definitions</strong> with <strong>two blank</strong>
  <strong>lines.</strong></p>
  
  <p>Method definitions inside a class are surrounded by a single blank
  line.</p>
  
  <p>Extra blank lines may be used (sparingly) to separate groups of
  related functions. Blank lines may be omitted between a bunch of
  related one-liners (e.g. a set of dummy implementations).</p>
  
  <p>Use <strong>blank lines in functions, sparingly</strong>, to indicate logical sections.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>The code</h1>

<p>Having <code>SUBJECT_PATH</code> and <code>QUERY_PATH</code> as module level constants is likely not a good idea. If they would ever change you will have to change your script. The first step to avoid that would be to change your function in order to accept input parameters instead of relying on a global variable. This part is covered in the <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/228909/92478">answer</a> of <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/168656/">scnerd</a>. The second logical step would be to have a look at Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>argparse</code></a> module, which will help you to create an easy command-line interface for your script. <code>argparse</code> also has a great <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/argparse.html#id1" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tutorial section</a> where you can learn by example.</p>

<p>Well, there is one thing you should consider, as you aim for genericity and composability:<br>
Doing things the other way around.</p>

<p>Rather than writing a <code>for_each_by_n()</code> (which would be better named <code>for_each_stride()</code>), use <code>std::for_each()</code> respectively the for-range-loop, and appropriate views to adapt the range.</p>

<p>As an example, with <a href="https://ericniebler.github.io/range-v3/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">range-v3</a>, you would use the view:</p>

<pre><code>auto view = view::stride(container, n);
</code></pre>

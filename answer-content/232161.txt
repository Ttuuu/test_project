<p>First, your code reformatted properly so it's more legible:</p>

<pre><code>def get_info(alpha, alpha_type):

    print("checking value of item:", alpha_type)

    try:
        if not alpha_type:
            raise

        return alpha, alpha_type

    except Exception:
        alpha_type = "vowel"
        return get_info(alpha, alpha_type)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main_type = None
    for elem in ["a", "e", "o"]:
        result = get_info(elem, alpha_type=main_type)
        main_type = result[1]
        print(result)
</code></pre>

<p>Take 20 minutes and read over <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP8</a>. It's Python's style guide and dictates how code should look. Most notably, you should have spaces after commas, and you shouldn't try to shove things onto one line in most cases (like you're doing with <code>raise</code>).</p>

<hr>

<p>Your code is abusing <code>try</code> and <code>raise</code>. It doesn't make any sense to <code>raise</code> in a <code>try</code> just to go to the <code>except</code>. You should just use make use of the <code>if</code> that you already have:</p>

<pre><code>def get_info(alpha, alpha_type):

    print("checking value of item:", alpha_type)

    if not alpha_type:
        return get_info(alpha, "vowel")

    else:
        return alpha, alpha_type
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Honestly, I don't understand what you're trying to do here, so that's really all I can comment on. I just wanted to point out the formatting and needless use of <code>try</code>.</p>

<p>The only simpler way to do this I've come up with is just to <code>sudo</code> every time and not worry about whether you're already the right user or not.  But overall it seems pretty straight forward and it should work fine as-is.  Some other suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Indent your code with the function.  Leaving the heredoc alone is ok.</li>
<li>Use <code>[[</code> for conditionals.  See <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/306115/79839">https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/306115/79839</a> for more context.</li>
<li>It is more modern to use <code>$()</code> for subcommands instead of backticks (<code>``</code>).  Parenthesis <code>()</code> are also used for creating subshells so the <code>$()</code> is just substituting the result of a subshell.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Declare at initialization</h3>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>        double dealtaX, deltaY, distance,x1, y1, x2, y2;
        String Line, item1, item2, item3, item4;
        String[] Sect;
        Scanner inFile;
        PrintWriter outFile;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>In most modern languages, including Java, we declare variables at initialization.  In a few cases, we need the scope to be greater so we declare earlier.  </p>

<p>There were some older languages where variables had to be declared at the beginning of blocks (e.g. the original version of C) or at the beginning of methods.  That is not necessary in Java.  </p>

<p>The four <code>item</code> variables are unnecessary.  You can just use the array directly.  </p>

<h3>Java naming conventions</h3>

<p>The general Java naming convention is to name constants as ALL_CAPS, types as PascalCase, and variables and methods as camelCase.  <code>Sect</code> and <code>Line</code> are variables, so they'd be <code>sect</code> and <code>line</code> in normal usage.  </p>

<p>I'm also not sure what Sect is supposed to be.  More common names include <code>pieces</code> or <code>tokens</code>, although more explanatory names are possible.  Arrays and collections are often plural, as they represent multiple things.  </p>

<h3>Don't repeat work</h3>

<p>You parse each string three times.  Once in <code>testDoubleLow</code>; once in <code>testDouble</code>; and then a third time in the <code>main</code> method.  It would be better to parse once and then store the result for the other two times.  </p>

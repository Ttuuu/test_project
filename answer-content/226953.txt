<p>A handful of critiques:</p>

<ul>
<li>As mentioned in the comments, this is undefined behavior: <code>SELECT @val = @val + ColumnName FROM AnyTable</code>. As such, you should avoid it. If you need to, use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/stuff-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>STUFF</code></a> or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/string-agg-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>STRING_AGG</code></a> instead</li>
<li>When creating a temp table, <code>(n)varchar</code> columns should specify their collation (e.g. <code>COLLATE DATABASE_DEFAULT</code> ) to avoid errors in case server collation and database collation differ.</li>
<li>Using <code>RETURN</code> or a chain of <code>IF</code> <code>ELSE IF</code> etc is going to raise fewer eyebrows than <code>GOTO</code></li>
<li>Don't just blindly insert into a table; always specify a column list.</li>
<li>Its cheaper to use table variables than temp tables; SQL Server doesn't need to do as much work for statistics and fewer latches of creation are required.</li>
<li>You generally don't need to drop the temp table (assuming this is called from a stored procedure) as that'll get done automatically by SQL Server</li>
<li>You could probably just return the list of disciplines + an error code, and let the consuming application handle presenting it in a friendly way. This also makes I18N someday in the future much easier.</li>
</ul>

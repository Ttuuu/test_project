<p>I think you could improve a lot. :)</p>

<p>I don't think you need an init function, it just add stuff and the code is difficult
to follow and understand.</p>

<p>The main function is yet your initialization.</p>

<p>Even the other functions are a big overhead and make the code complicated.</p>

<p>I put inline comment to explain the code.</p>

<pre><code>function notification(notificationType, message, delay) {
  // you don't need to attach things to this, just use variables.
  const classNameSelector = 'notification';
  const disappearingClass = 'disappei'
  if ($('.'+classNameSelector).length === 0)
    return; // if component is still there you want to avoid recreate it, but
            // so don't need to load all the code, just exit at the beginning.

  // what about place in a template or in a hidden div?
  const _notification = $('&lt;div class=" ' + classNameSelector + ' ' +
    notificationType + '"&gt;&lt;p&gt;' + message +
    '&lt;/p&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-times fa-lg close-notification"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;');

  $(body).append(_notification);

  // here I'm a bit confuse, you have a delay, but you set an arbitrary number
  // to remove the notification box: 1200
  // So I changed it in a way that works for me:
  const startDiappearing = delay / 3
  const disappearingAll = delay - startDiappearing

  // the first timeout is startDisappearing
  let removeTimeout;
  const disappearingTimeOut = setTimeout(function() {
    _notification.addClass('disappearing');
    removeTimeout = setTimeout(function () {
        _notification.remove();
    }, disappearingAll);
  }, startDiappearing);

  // Last but not last the bind to the click event
  _notification.on('click', function() {
    clearTimeout(disappearingTimeOut);
    clearTimeout(removeTimeout);

    _notification.remove();
  });
}
</code></pre>

<p>I know you feel there is some duplication of <em>remove()</em> but is just a lib call and just one.</p>

<p>The purpose here is made something simple and short as effectively simple and short, avoiding overengineering some part of code.</p>

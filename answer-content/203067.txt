<p>One thing I'm confused about while reading this, is <code>gridId as Byte</code> - I assume it can only be <code>1</code> or <code>2</code> - ID of the player, unless I'm mistaken.</p>

<p>So in <code>RangeToGridCoord</code> you take the <code>gridID</code> <em>ByRef</em>, but <em>why?</em></p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>Public Function RangeToGridCoord(ByVal target As Range, ByRef gridId As Byte) As IGridCoord
    If target.Count &gt; 1 Then Exit Function
    For gridId = 1 To 2
        With PlayerGrid(gridId)
            If Not Intersect(.Cells, target) Is Nothing Then
                Set RangeToGridCoord = _
                    GridCoord.Create(xPosition:=target.Column - .Column + 1, _
                                     yPosition:=target.Row - .Row + 1)
                Exit Function
            End If
        End With
    Next
End Function
</code></pre>

<p>You call this function in three different worksheet events, passing a null <code>gridId</code> each time, then you make it iterate over both possibilities -</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>For gridID = 1 to 2
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe (read: definitely) I'm missing some interactions that occur from/to different game areas or mechanics, but this alone looks unnecessary. You're converting a target to a coordinate, but only for the player whose grid intersects that target - but unless a target is more than 1 cell, it can only ever intersect 1 or 0 player grids. Maybe this has something to do with the <code>IGridCoord</code>, but from here, <em>on this question</em> I don't understand the need for the loop - either it intersects or it doesn't, assuming you pass a non-null <code>gridId</code> to the function, right?</p>

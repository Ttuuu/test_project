<p>Since I'm unable to compile your program (there is no full working code), my review will be a little limited. But consider at least the following points.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Do <em>not</em> pass <code>Individual</code> by-value when it is not necessary. This can be very costly. Instead, prefer passing by const-ref as in <code>const Individual&amp; individualToEvaluate</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>It seems that <code>y_result</code> should go inside the first of the for-loops, then you don't have to set it to zero at the end.</p></li>
<li><p>You can try replacing a call to <code>pow(error, 2)</code> by your own squaring function that just returns <code>x * x</code>; I have noticed this to be a little faster than <code>std::pow</code> sometimes in the past (but maybe things are different nowadays).</p></li>
<li><p>Make <code>diff</code> const. There are <em>many</em> more local variables that you should mark const as well. It makes errors less likely to happen and improves readability.</p></li>
<li><p>Doing I/O operations like <code>cout</code> and <code>endl</code> will slow down your program. Get rid of them if you need speed. Also, don't use <code>endl</code> when <code>\n</code> suffices.</p></li>
<li><p>It won't hurt to precompute <code>images[m].rows - WINDOW_SIZE</code> (and <code>images[m].cols - WINDOW_SIZE</code>) as const variables before the for-loop. This can speed up your execution by a tiny margin. You can also precompute <code>row + STEP</code> and <code>col + STEP</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Your decoding function is quite messy. You could borrow an idea from <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/216741/40063">this answer</a> to make it prettier.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This is still quite superficial and you can't hope to get much more unless you isolate your issue and post more details, I believe. </p>

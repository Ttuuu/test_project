<p>Your performance problem is that you are redoing the same computations over and over again.  You keep recomputing the running sums at the extremities.  You should have a more intelligent algorithm that caches the running sums from both directions, or precomputes them.  Those questions are very often about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming" rel="nofollow noreferrer">dynamic programming</a>.</p>

<p>I was confused by the function name <code>isEven</code> (I was thinking even/odd); I think <code>isEqual</code> is better.</p>

<p>I don't get why <code>isEven</code> has the function arguments <code>leftSum</code> and <code>rightSum</code>.  Since they are always set to 0, they should just be variables within the method initialized to 0.</p>

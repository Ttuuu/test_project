<p>Do I get it right that the intention of your code is to brute force guess the contents of a known string value? As noted by @Pharap your approach seems quite complicated and a simpler version would indeed be faster. </p>

<p>I took the liberty of writing an alternative, which was able to match an input value of 4096 characters in just over a second.</p>

<pre><code>var charset = " !\"#$%&amp;'()*+,-./0123456789:;&lt;=&gt;?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~";
function crack(knownPassword) {

    var start = (new Date()).getTime(),
        guess = '',
        c;

    while(guess !== knownPassword) {
        for(var i = 0; i &lt; charset.length; i++) {
            c = charset.charAt(i);
            if (c === knownPassword.charAt(guess.length)) {
                guess += c;
                console.log(guess);
                break;
            }
        }

    }

    console.log('mycrack', ((new Date()) * 1) - start, 'ms');
};
</code></pre>

<p>It's still not very useful though, as it requires one to know the string you're about to guess.</p>

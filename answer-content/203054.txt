<p>Personally I don't like the way <code>UITableView</code>s work with a <code>delegate</code> and <code>dataSource</code> yet there's no real way to say "Here's the data". You are kind of forced to either send around copies of your data or put everything into one class. There's tons of mixing of the M, V and C layers in one class going on.</p>

<p>However, it should be possible to use a separate implementation of the <code>dataSource</code> and `delegate. While in this example there's little code, in some cases you might cross (my personal) soft limit of 200 lines of code or even the hard limit of 300 in one file.</p>

<p>In my Objective-C / Storyboards days I actually had implementations where I would use several objects all linked together via @IBOutlets. So a delegate, dataSource and tableView. The delegate could have a <code>weak</code> ref to the <code>dataSource</code> and the <code>dataSource</code> had the actual data. Not using the <code>selected</code> mechanism for button-like actions could allow you to sever the ties between the <code>delegate</code> and the data.</p>

<p>So I don't disapprove of what you're doing because you're trying to do your best with the bad hand of cards that Apple dealt you. But you could try to have the data only exist on the dataSource implementation. Also I see you doing a lot of stuff to the cell in dequeue, that should definitely move to the implementation of the cell because it's doing V code in an M class. I use a <code>configure(with: *someData*)</code> function that sets it up further.</p>

<p>If you try to separate the M from the V and the C you will see pretty clearly where you should cut it up.</p>

<p>The rescue in your <code>fetch_aws_instances</code> method is pointless. Rescuing errors just to re-raise them identically, is the same as not rescuing them at all. </p>

<p>You should only rescue when you want to customize what happens if the error is raisedd. Unless you want to move the Rails.logger calls to the <code>fetch_aws_instances</code> method, you should only have the rescues when you call it (as you do in your second code block)</p>

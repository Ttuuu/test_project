<p>You should definitely familiarize with the 'modulus' operator <code>%</code> â€“ calculating the 'un-rotated' (original) position of the item to find is waaay faster than performing a hundred thousand rotations (<em>k</em> is up to \$10^5\$) of one hundred thousand-item array (<em>n</em> up to \$10^5\$).<br>
It is even faster than a single rotation.</p>

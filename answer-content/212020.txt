<p>I'm going to look over this in further detail later this evening, but from an initial review I would not remove objects from the pool and add them back later. I would only remove from the pool if the object should never be used again.</p>

<h2>Adding and Removing</h2>

<p>It's easy to understand a fundamental concept of adding and removing objects from a collection. However, when your collection is meant to hold reusable data, why are you removing from it every time you want an object that isn't active. Instead, just set the object to an active state to ensure the same object cannot be pulled twice. Then only remove objects once you determine they are no longer needed. Some eligible criteria for removing objects from your pool are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Enough time has passed that you no longer need to store above <strong>n</strong> objects.</li>
<li>Your scene has ended and you no longer need any of the objects.

<ul>
<li>The exception to this is if your objects are shared across scenes; revert to case 1.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>I will add more later this evening along with an example to further assist.</p>

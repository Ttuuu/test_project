  <li><p>A class is a blueprint or template or set of instructions to build a specific type of object. Every object is built from a class.</p></li>
  <li><p>An instance is a specific object built from a specific class. It is assigned to a reference variable that is used to access all of the instance's properties and methods.</p></li>

<p>Ryan and nate should both be an <strong>instance</strong>. They have the same properties. From the 2 classes you can extract one <strong>template</strong> and make it a <code>Human</code> <strong>class</strong>.</p>

<p>What you are doing now is hard coding their properties into the methods. Try to make it more dynamic by creating one class.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>public void eat() {
    System.out.println("Nate has eaten");
}
</code></pre>

<p>Can then be tranformed into:</p>

<pre><code>public void eat() {
    System.out.println(this.name + " has eaten");
}
</code></pre>

<p>Minor comments here since scott_fakename has provided a pretty good start...</p>

<p>Extract the user input part from <code>show_menu</code> into its own method, so that each method is only dealing with one thing.</p>

<p>You have some idea of showing 'tracing' messages for debugging/troubleshooting, ever considered using a logging framework? Not sure if this is beyond what you need to hand in this assignment, just a thought...</p>

<p>I also think using one static class-wide <code>Random</code> instance is good enough for all the random number generation.</p>

<p>As for consolidating <code>add</code> and <code>subtract</code> methods into a single one that takes an extra parameter to control the calculation, you can consider using enumerations to indicate the different modes. E.g.:</p>

<pre><code>enum Mode {
    ADD, SUBTRACT;
}

...

public void calculation(Mode mode) {
    ...
    int num1, num2, result;
    ...
    switch (mode) {
    case ADD:
        result = num1 + num2;
        break;
    case SUBTRACT:
        result = num1 - num2;
        break;
    }
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>In fact you'll probably want to keep this as a simple method itself (similar to your <code>generateRandomNumber</code>, and have an outside method to get the user input (following scott_fakename's suggestion) to do the comparison.</p>

<p>The whitespace needs a lot of changes to be PEP8-compliant. The capitalisation is also unconventional: functions and variables in Python usually start with a lower-case letter.</p>

<hr>

<p>The meaning of <code>Player</code> is not entirely clear, and the logic is hard to follow because of that. The convention for this type of combinatorial game is to denote a position as "N" (<strong>N</strong>ext player wins) or "P" (<strong>P</strong>revious player wins). So I think that <code>Solve</code> should be renamed <code>position_is_N</code>, and then the <code>Player</code> variable becomes unnecessary.</p>

<p><code>if condition: return</code> doesn't need a following <code>else:</code>.</p>

<p>The loop can be tidied up considerably with <code>range</code> and <code>any</code>. I think this is equivalent:</p>

<pre><code>@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def position_is_N(x, y):
    return x % y == 0 or \
           any(not position_is_N(max(x2, y), min(x2, y))
               for x2 in range(x % y, x, y))
</code></pre>

<p>A comment about the constraint that <code>x &gt;= y</code> would be nice.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>range of both X and Y is 1 to 10^18</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Consider inputs <code>10**18, 3</code> (or other similarly small <code>y</code>). How many times might the loop run in the worst case?</p>

<p>As a rule of thumb, for a challenge like this if you need to do anything more than <code>10**9</code> times your algorithm is wrong. I can only suggest that you will need a complete rewrite to pass the time limit, so you should build a table of small values and see whether you can spot and prove a pattern. The problem is probably far more about mathematics than programming.</p>

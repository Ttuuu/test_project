<p>I agree with @Mast that you are asking the wrong question. IMHO your question should be: "Is it a good idea to get user input in form of a JavaScript array?" and the short answer woudl be "no". The long answer would be: </p>

<p>Why did you choose this form of input? Aren't there better input methods? Where is the string coming from?  </p>

<p>However, if you don't have any other choice, then the proper solution would be to use a more <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=lenient+json+parser+javascript" rel="nofollow noreferrer">lenient "JSON" parser</a>. One possiblity could be to use a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=yaml%20parser%20javascript" rel="nofollow noreferrer">YAML parser</a>. YAML is a superset of JSON that allows (among other things) JSON-like markup.</p>

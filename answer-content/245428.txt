<p>This is not a review, but an extended comment.</p>
<p>Theoretically you are right, a <em>time</em> complexity of the first approach is <span class="math-container">\$O(n)\$</span>. However, there is also a <em>space</em> complexity, also <span class="math-container">\$O(n)\$</span>, due to the <code>Map</code>, and the map is a very heavyweight data structure. Even though it promises a constant time access, it is only an amortized constant time, and the constant could be quite large. You must also take into account its cache unfriendlyness.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, both approaches are suboptimal. There is a way to solve the problem <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore_majority_vote_algorithm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">in a linear time in constant space</a>.</p>

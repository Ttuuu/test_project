<p>I like the idea, but you should carefully explain how this works in comments.</p>

<p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>  MyLazy myLazy = new MyLazy();

  int value1 = myLazy.Get(() =&gt; 42);
  Console.WriteLine(value1);

  int value2 = myLazy.Get(() =&gt; 65);
  Console.WriteLine(value2);
</code></pre>

<p>It correctly prints out:</p>

<pre><code>42
42
</code></pre>

<p>But even that we know the answer to everything is 42, it isn't that intuitive. The problem is obviously that you have to - or can - provide a <code>creator</code> function per call to <code>Get&lt;T&gt;(Func&lt;T&gt; creator)</code> and that it is arbitrary, but only the first actually has any effect.</p>

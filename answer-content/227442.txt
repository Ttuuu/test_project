<p>Consistently formatting your code will help it look professional. There are some slight variations in style but many conventions are well-established such as always putting a space before <code>{</code>.</p>

<p>Be particularly strict about your indentation (everything inside <code>setInterval</code> needs one more) and don't mix tabs and spaces (such as the <code>align-self</code> lines). It's not cheating to have your editor format your code for you.</p>

<p>I tend minimalist on comments (preferring to put effort into naming and refactoring instead). With that in mind, your comments are excessive. For example I would change this:</p>

<pre><code>                    &lt;div id="day"&gt; &lt;!--day counter --&gt;

                    &lt;/div&gt; &lt;!--end of day counter --&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>To simply this:</p>

<pre><code>                    &lt;div id="day-counter"&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>See how the code documents itself?</p>

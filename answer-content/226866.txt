<p>What I hate most.<br>
Is looking for the variables that the class uses to hold the values. IT took my 10 minutes to find them:</p>

<pre><code>    std::array&lt;std::aligned_storage_t&lt;sizeof(T), alignof(T)&gt;, N&gt; elems;
    std::size_t count{0}; // invariant: count &lt;= N
}; // class static_vector

/**
 * @cond DETAIL
 */

} // namespace detail
</code></pre>

<p>They are like three quarters of the way down the file. This is the most important part of the class it should not be hard to find them. If you are not going to put them at the top at least mark them in a way that we can search for them!</p>

<p>You know why I searched for them. Because the constructors don't initialize them so I was wondering are they self initialized. So yes they are but it was hard to find them because they are not mentioned in the constructors. This is why I dislike this way of initializing the members. I want to look at the constructor and see all them members correctly initialized not rely on code review to search through the code and check (a bit pedantic as turning on warnings would tell me but still I hate it).</p>

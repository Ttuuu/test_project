<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>you create a variable here and use it only once</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>bool taskExecutionCancelled = IsScripteExecutionCancelled();
if (taskExecutionCancelled)
{
    tokenSource.Cancel();
}
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>I would just use the method in the if statement, like </p>

<pre><code>if (IsScripteExecutionCancelled())
{
    tokenSource.Cancel();
}
</code></pre>

<p>if you were going to use this value somewhere else and didn't want it evaluated again, then you could assign it to a variable, but then you need to keep in mind that calling the variable will not run the method.</p>

<p>I'm rather wondering why you are splitting your values at all, and even more curious why it hasnt been pointed out yet. When you look at your bank account you dont say i have 10 $100 plus 50 $10 you just say I have $1500.</p>

<p>Spltting up your currency just introduced a lot of potential bugs and is only ever interesting for the front-end. I'd just let the amount of currency be one number and let the front-end deal with splitting it up into copper, silver, gold. The way you display the currency should, in my opinion, be irrelevant to your game-logic. </p>

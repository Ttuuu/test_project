<p>You should not be throwing this excepiton in the <code>BuildObject</code> method (actually nowhere). It's not only that it is used only by the framework itself but it's also misleading. What parameter does it mean? Especially that <code>BuildObject</code> does not have any! If your utility crashes and someone else would be looking for the cause, it would be super confusing for him.</p>

<p>You have two choices how to fix it. First, and this is the best one, validate the parameters in the constructor so it's not possible to create it with invalid parameters. Second, slightly worse but still more helpful than the current implementation, you can throw the <code>InvalidOperationException</code> and tell the user that the object has been initialized with invalid data. Either way the user would instantly know what is wrong.</p>

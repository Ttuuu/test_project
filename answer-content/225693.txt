<p>The first two points can be answered by <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html#extension-DerivingVia" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>DerivingVia</code></a>. It is one of the newer extensions that allows to derive a class instance by delegating to an existing instance for a representationally equivalent type. You can do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>newtype PitchWrapper a = PitchWrapper a

instance PitchClass a =&gt; Num (PitchWrapper a) where
    (PitchWrapper a) + (PitchWrapper b) = a +: b
    ... and do on

deriving via (PitchWrapper NoteName) instance Num NoteName
deriving via (PitchWrapper Solfege) instance Num Solfege
deriving via (PitchWrapper Interval) instance Num Interval
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>That said, even though this is possible, I must warn you that it is not a good idea. </p>

<p>This is a very common pattern that I see in newcomers (including myself): overload all the things, declare operators for everything, make everything as short as possible. The language makes it possible, so let's run wild with it.</p>

<p>Never works out well in practice. If you follow this pattern, you usually end up with spaghetti code that nobody can understand without looking up every single character.</p>

<p>I would even argue that in this case it doesn't make sense. Look: notes do not actually constitute a ring. You don't add two notes together to get another note. You add intervals to notes, but not notes to each other.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now, about extensions.</p>

<p>Unlike most languages, which simply add new features in every new release, the Haskell designers chose to give the power to the user. When you install a new version of GHC, you don't just get all the new features. You get a choice to opt-in.</p>

<p>This is what most extensions are: merely an opt-in mechanism for new language features.</p>

<p>It is true that there are some problematic extensions, but those are few and far between. In most cases, you'll be just fine turning on everything you see in those error messages.</p>

<p>There are numerous works on the internet describing and/or recommending particular sets of extensions to use. <a href="https://limperg.de/ghc-extensions/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Here's one example</a>.</p>

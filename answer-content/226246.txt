<p>BubbleSort is not an efficient algorithm. Talking time-complexity it runs in <span class="math-container">\$O(n^2)\$</span> which is okay given a very small array, but for a larger amount of numbers its almost unusable.</p>

<p>This is a comparison between a few sorting algorithms that i wrote in C#. As you can see the only advantage of BubbleSort over the other algorithms is that it is very easy to program.

<p>Anyway - back to your code. I would your implementation is good although i find the first one way more readable.
All in all if you just wanted to implement BubbleSort you did a good job, but if you really want to sort a list, you should  definitely consider another algorithm that runs in <span class="math-container">\$O(log(n))\$</span>.</p>

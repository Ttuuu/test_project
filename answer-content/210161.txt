<p>Calling <code>PriorityQueue.contains</code> is O(n) in the size of the priority queue and this ruins your performance.</p>

<p>For example here:</p>

<pre><code>if(!openSet.contains(map)){
    map.setPathG(Integer.MAX_VALUE);//if this tile has not been added set the G to max value 
    map.setPathH(getDistance(map, nodeEnd));//find cost to to end node
}
</code></pre>

<p>It is ok to have duplicates in the open set just check if the current node is in the closed set when you pull it out of the open set before continuing with it. Or if you don't like that, you can have a parallel open set to the open priority queue.</p>

<p>There is a much easier solution which is strictly <span class="math-container">\$\Theta(n)\$</span>. Given <span class="math-container">\$\ell\$</span> the input list:</p>

<ul>
<li>Filter for just positive numbers: <span class="math-container">\$\ell_{&gt;0} = \{i \in \ell\mid i &gt; 0\}\$</span></li>
<li>Compute the maximum and the sum of the elements of <span class="math-container">\$\ell_{&gt;0}\$</span>. Namely, <span class="math-container">\$m = \max \ell_{&gt;0}\$</span> and <span class="math-container">\$ s = \sum _ {i \in \ell_{&gt;0}} i\$</span></li>
<li>Now there are two cases: whether it is missing a number in <span class="math-container">\$[1, m)\$</span> or it is missing <span class="math-container">\$m+1\$</span>.</li>
<li>We know that <span class="math-container">\$1 + 2 + \dots + m=m\times(1+m)/2\$</span>. Call this sum <span class="math-container">\$t\$</span>. Compare <span class="math-container">\$t\$</span> with <span class="math-container">\$s\$</span>. If they are equal,  it means that the sum is complete, so return the next integer, <span class="math-container">\$m+1\$</span>. Otherwise, the difference will tell you which number is missing: <span class="math-container">\$t-s\$</span>.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can achieve constant space by storing just three numbers: <span class="math-container">\$m\$</span>, <span class="math-container">\$s\$</span> and <span class="math-container">\$t\$</span>. Where <span class="math-container">\$m\$</span> and <span class="math-container">\$s\$</span> will require <span class="math-container">\$|\ell|\$</span> steps to be computed. Consider this pseudocode.</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>m = 0 # You can safely assume 0 here (or l[0] if you wish)
s = 0
for i in l:
   if i &gt; 0:
     s += i
     if i &gt; m:
       m = i

t = m*(m+1) /2
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, then computing <span class="math-container">\$t\$</span> is <span class="math-container">\$\Theta(1)\$</span>.</p>

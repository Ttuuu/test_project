<p>You're wrong :)</p>

<p>There's a sea of repeated code here. You need to seriously DRY it up. I don't have enough of your system to test this myself, so you need to; but you should do something like</p>

<pre><code>class RenderTag:
    @staticmethod
    def get_context_data():
        annotations = Annotations()

        def to_json(x):
            return x.to_json()

        context = {}
        for i in range(1, 5):
            df_type = getattr(annotations, f'df_type_{i}')
            categories = annotations.filter_categories(df_type)
            for j, category in enumerate(categories, 1):
                js = category.apply(to_json, axis=1).to_json(orient='split')
                context[f'json{j}_{i}'] = js

        return context
</code></pre>

<p>That assumes that <code>Annotations</code> cannot change. You can make it even simpler if <code>Annotations.df_type</code> is stored as a 3-tuple, instead of three separate attributes. Elsewhere in your code, you really should carry this philosophy forward - instead of hard-coding three or four variables with numbers in the name, just maintain one tuple (if immutable) or list (if mutable).</p>

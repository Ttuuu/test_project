<p>Because you specifically ask about security:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For comparing hashes like SHA, you should use <a href="https://secure.php.net/hash_equals" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>hash_equals()</code></a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you are requiring the use of a password, you shouldn't use SHA-512. While it's certainly better than MD5, instead use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt" rel="nofollow noreferrer">bcrypt</a>. Bcrypt is <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/q/4781">heavily recommended</a> for password storage, especially long-term.</p>
<p>With bcrypt, instead of using <code>hash()</code> and <code>hash_equals()</code>, you would use <a href="https://secure.php.net/password_hash" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>password_hash()</code></a> and <a href="https://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.password-verify.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>password_verify()</code></a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Should new directories really have read and execute permissions for the group and other users? Likewise, I would check the permissions of the file itself.</p>
<p>I would personally have the files as <code>0600</code> and directories as <code>0700</code> unless other permissions are needed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Checking the file extension is only helpful for preventing naive false uploads. On Linux and most UNIX-like operating systems, a file extension means very little (if anything). It could be any type of file with a JPEG extension, likewise anything could have a JPEG file extension.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't know about the rest of the code.</p>

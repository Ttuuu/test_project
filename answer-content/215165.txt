<p><strong>Advice 1</strong></p>

<p>This implementation is not thread safe. For example, if two threads invoked <code>getElement(key1)</code> simultaneously, they may runs to <code>concurrentLinkedQueue.add(key)</code> at same times(they both performed delete and get, but delete will fail the second time or just do nothing), then two same keys will be added.</p>

<p><strong>Advice 2</strong></p>

<p>Maybe <code>capacity</code> is more suitable than <code>maxSize</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Advice 3</strong></p>

<p><code>LinkedHashMap</code> is often used as LRU cache. </p>

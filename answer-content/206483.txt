<p>Converting props to data is a bad idea if it is not a copy of the <code>prop</code> because you might end up in a situation where your parent changes your <code>prop</code> and your component changes your <code>data</code> and then which is right? The component manipulating <code>props</code> is not good. Instead decide which is externally sourced (from parent) and which is internally manipulated, and then assign each to either prop or data.</p>

<p>Since your code in particular doesn't actually manipulate the data or props you are simply better off if you remove the <code>data</code> key completely, just leave it with <code>props</code> and you can access the values in precisely the same way using <code>this.totalStarsData</code> for example. You can clearly see that having a <code>props</code> key and manually entering the same info into <code>data</code> is ugly code anyway.</p>

<p>Having that global variable is unhelpful in my opinion, and probably bad practice since it goes against the decoupling of the component. Why not make it another <code>prop</code> with a default value of false?</p>

<p>Please note that there is an "error" especially in the <strong><em>score</em></strong> predicate.
For example, by launching the command: *l<code>score([red, blue, green], [red, red, blue], S)</code>, the result is <code>S = [1,2]</code> instead of <code>[1,1]</code>. And there are many of these cases.</p>

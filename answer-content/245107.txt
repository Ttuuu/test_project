<h3>possible race condition</h3>
<p>This code seem to have a race condition:</p>
<pre><code>if self.progress_check(progress_hash):
    return json_response({
        "success": False,
        'result': "This report is already being generated",
    })

file = open(f'/root/progress_data/{progress_hash}', 'w+')
</code></pre>
<p>The question doesn't say what server is being used, but it presumably uses threads, processes or async techniques.  After a first thread or process executes the <code>if</code> statement but before the file gets opened, other threads or processes could pass the <code>if</code> statement.  This can result in multiple computations, multiple files, trying to delete a file multiple times, etc.  I think some kind of lock or semaphore may be needed.</p>

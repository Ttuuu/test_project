<h2>Pre-compilation</h2>

<p>In theory, you're going to want to call this function more than once. That means that you only want to pay the cost of regex compilation once, and you should move your <code>re.compile</code> calls out of the function, setting your regex variables in the module's global scope.</p>

<h2>Type-hinting</h2>

<p><code>s</code> is <code>s: str</code>, and <code>char</code> is (I think) also <code>char: str</code>.</p>

<h2>'Removed from the string'?</h2>

<p>I think this is the fault of unclear requirements, but - it would make more sense for the <code>char</code> argument to be <em>the character[s] to strip from the string edges</em>, not <em>characters to remove from anywhere in the string</em>. As such, you would need to re-evaluate how you create your regex.</p>

<h2>Combine left and right</h2>

<p>There's no need for two regexes. You can use one with a capturing group:</p>

<pre><code>^\s*(.*?)\s*$
</code></pre>

<h2>Declarations</h2>

<p>My first comment is <code>Option explicit</code>. <strong>Every. Single. Time.</strong> </p>

<p>Your first line of code is :</p>

<pre><code>Set objShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
</code></pre>

<p>Why? <code>objshell</code> is not declared or used. And while on the matter of declarations:</p>

<pre><code>Dim WDR, WDCheck, ShipmentID As Object
</code></pre>

<p>declares <code>WDR</code> and <code>WDCheck</code> as Variant, not Object. </p>

<p>Youi are writing a utility tool - using <em>early binding</em> instead of <em>late binding</em> will improve the code. (<code>Dim wdApp as Word.Application</code> : <code>Set wdApp = New Word.Application</code>, assuming you are running this from Excel).</p>

<h2>Macro recorder</h2>

<p>To me it is obvious you used the macro recorder and then simply copied the code to get what you wanted. In order to improve your code, look at each step that has been recorded (a couple of lines each time) to work out what is really happening</p>

<p>You open a word document, but do not assign that open document to the declared variable <code>wdDoc</code>. Which should be declared as <code>Word.Document</code> not <code>Object</code>. Hint: <code>Word.Application.Documents.Open</code> returns a Document.</p>

<p>Once you start looking at the recorded code and making sensible changes, you will stop working with the nebulous <code>Selection</code> and start working directly with defined objects that you can control better.</p>

<h2>Approach</h2>

<p>A good approach is to first clean the input data. This can be as simple as identifying the block of text to be imported, copying that to an intermediate work area (perhaps a temporary word document, or a work area in your excel file) and then setting up the data format to suit your next step (the direct import).</p>

<p>What I have inferred from your code is that each column is separated by multiple spaces to create a nicely formatted output. So you can have two approaches here:</p>

<ul>
<li>replace those spaces with a known delimiter</li>
<li>use the fixed column widths to do a text input into Excel (noted by
@MathieuGuindon in the comments)</li>
</ul>

<p>The first approach is useful if there is no consistency between the documents. The second is useful if there is this consistency.</p>

<p>Either way, at the end of these steps you have a consistent form of input data that you can now directly import into Excel. </p>

<p>I have deliberately not included any example code. The initial steps of refactoring the macro-recorded code is great learning experience for yourself and is something that will give you good insight into how you can improve your own code.</p>

<p>Looking forwards to the seeing the refactored code as a new article here for further review! </p>

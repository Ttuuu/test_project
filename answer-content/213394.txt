<p>Be wary of this:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>void clearScreen()
{
    printf("\x1b[2J\x1b[1;1H");
}
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Whilst many terminals support the ANSI command set, not all do, so hard-coding this escape code will limit the program's flexibility.</p>

<p>There are libraries (such as Curses) that help with this, but that's likely overkill for this purpose.  The pragmatic approach here is to outsource to the standard command using <code>system()</code> - on POSIX systems, you'll just invoke <code>clear</code>, for example.</p>

<p>That said, I'd advise against clearing screen repeatedly - it makes it much harder for the user to go back and review the actions that have been performed.</p>

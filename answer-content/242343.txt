<p>The problem I see there is that when a new view controller subscribes, the previous one stops receiving notifications. There reason is because delegation is a one to one relationship.</p>

<p>"View controllers can subscribe to its delegate" That is wrong, it should be something like: "A view controller can subscribe to its delegate"</p>

<p>If that is what you want, then it is OK.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you want to have several view controllers listening for those events, you need a 1 to many relationship. You can use NoticationCenter, KVO, Observables (RxSwift or Combine), or create your own solution, like:</p>

<p>addObserver removeObserver an array to save these observers (that conform to a protocol) and when triggering the event, just use observers.forEach { $0.sendEvent... }</p>

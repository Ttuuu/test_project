<li><p>Not sure that a class definition makes a lot of sense here since you donâ€™t really have any real behavior being defined in this class. </p></li>
<li><p>Destructuring can also help you populate variables from the input array directly.</p></li>
<li><p>camelCase is generally preferred in JS vs. snake_case. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>For example you might simplify to something like this:</p>

<pre><code>const conversionFn = ( [ channelId, payload, sequence ] ) =&gt; {  
  return { channelId, payload, sequence };
};
</code></pre>
    </div>

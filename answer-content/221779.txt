<p>Well, you have one huge bug in the code. You have <code>return â€¦</code> as the last line of the <code>while(1)</code> loop. This <code>return</code> will be hit the moment first <code>arr1</code> and <code>arr2</code> elements match but <code>arr3</code> does not contain that element. I suggest you to use Roland's approach as it works and keeps your general algorithm the same.</p>

<p>This can be condensed and simplified a bit more.</p>

<pre><code>Math.random().toString(16)
</code></pre>

<p>This line will return a decimal value which we want to turn into a String. We also want the number to be written in base 16.  So, by doing these two methods we get a result that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>0.ae5782d36ac5331
</code></pre>

<p>All we need to do is skip past the zero and the decimal and grab the first 6 characters. We don't need to worry about padding because the length of the number that is returned by <code>Math.random()</code> will always be more than 6 digits.</p>

<p>This leaves us with the following:</p>

<pre><code>return "#" + Math.random().toString(16).slice(2, 8);
</code></pre>

<p>The final step is adding the "#" in front of our 6 characters.</p>

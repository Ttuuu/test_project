<h1>List Unpacking</h1>

<p>Instead of assigning each variable to an index of the list, you can assign both variables to the list and it will unpack each item of the list to its respective variable.</p>

<pre><code>w, h = size
</code></pre>

<h1>String Formatting</h1>

<p>I personally would rather use <code>f""</code> since it allows you to visually see where your variables are in the string, instead of remembering which number (<code>{0}</code>, <code>{1}</code>, etc) is associated with which variable.</p>

<pre><code>print(f"The {ordinal(i + 1)} darkest grayscale value is {value}%, quantity is {cnt}.")
</code></pre>

<h1>Unnecessary Type Conversions</h1>

<p>In <code>ordinal</code>, you convert <code>n</code> to an integer. However, you already pass an integer as an argument, so no need to convert. Also, if you want to use <code>f""</code>, you don't need to convert variables to strings before you format them with your strings. You can put the raw values in and python will work all of it out.</p>

<h1>Constants</h1>

<p>There are a lot of magic numbers in your program. Specifically, <code>255</code> and <code>100</code> show up a lot. I would define constants that contain these values and use those instead.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I'm not sure if the manually-allocated array in <code>LevenshteinDistance()</code> is necessary when you can probably still use <code>std::vector</code>.</p>

<p>If this is still necessary, then you could consider accounting for failure with <code>new</code> if it could help make your program more robust.  Still, having to do something like this suggests that you should avoid manual memory allocation as much as possible in C++.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to avoid single-character variable names, unless they're loop counters.  The names <code>m</code> and <code>n</code> may work in a mathematical sense, but you shouldn't assume that the user (or even you in several years) will not be confused by this.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider better names than <code>s1</code> and <code>s2</code>, based on their intended uses (you already have info on this in some comments in <code>main()</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Keep your whitespace use consistent and don't add it where unnecessary.  For instance, there's a lot of excess whitespace before and within <code>main()</code> for some reason.  This does nothing to improve readability.</p></li>
<li><p>This is quite unclear and is practically a magic number:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>int num = 13309;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The comment next to it describes this variable, so just rename it as such, and make it <code>const</code> since it's a constant.  If you need a comment to describe something like this, then you may need to rethink your naming.  Comments should mostly be needed for more complex explanations.</p></li>
<li><p>You attempt to open a file for reading, but only display an error on failure and continue executing the program.  You should instead terminate the program with a valid error code on failure after displaying the error.  The error itself should also be printed to <code>std::cerr</code> instead of <code>std::cout</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Prefer a better alternative to a "pause" when running the code through certain IDEs, such as:</p>

<pre><code>std::cin.get();
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

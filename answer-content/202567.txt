<p>From my point of view, there's nothing wrong with doing the network requests like you are doing it <strong>IF you are using MVC</strong>. You are just asking the model for the target request and using blocks to manage the data returned. Maybe I would only put in the view controller the requests that after being executed, need to update some UI (not the case for your <code>getRule</code> and <code>getAppSystem</code> methods), and put the other ones in an model layer that manages basic data for the app.</p>

<p>Talking about battery consumption, I think there is no problem at all with your requests if those requests are justified and you need to call them anyway. Of course, you should avoid as much as possible to call them continuously because the battery drain.</p>

<p>Maybe I would group some of them in one single request.</p>

<p>If you find a problem with <code>AFNetworking</code> to perform batch requests for the lack of a completion handler, you can use dispatch groups:</p>

<pre><code>// create the group
dispatch_group_t group = dispatch_group_create();
// before calling each request
dispatch_group_enter(group);
// on the completion of each request
dispatch_group_leave(group);
// to use it as a completion handler
dispatch_group_notify(group, dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_HIGH, 0), ^{
    NSLog(@"all requests finished!");
});
</code></pre>

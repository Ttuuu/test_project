<p>NB: Note that I'm biased towards a more functional style</p>

<p>Good:</p>

<ul>
<li>List of suits and cards with plain old data</li>
<li>The update function is declarative. Very good</li>
<li>Event handlers mostly delegate to other functions (but you can do even more)</li>
</ul>

<p>Bad:</p>

<ul>
<li>Check your code formatting</li>
<li>Storing phrases and other ui-related things directly in the state is not good. It adds noise, and it should be done in the ui logic</li>
<li>Game result should probably be some kind of enum. The ui should decide how to display the enum</li>
<li>There's too much state in the hand class. You can get rid of almost the entire class, and replace with util functions operating on plain old data.
These util functions can operate on any hand, including dealer's</li>
<li>The game should probe hands for information when it calculates who's the winner, not the other way around. It seems weird that the hand tells the game it has won.
If you also make a separate function out of this you can use early returns to avoid nested if's</li>
<li>Update ui should take required state as an argument. Not rely on globals, and preferrably relying on some sort of state object rather than the entire game object</li>
<li>A typical game loop consists of an update function: 1. reading events 2. updating the game state 3. updating the ui. I suggest you also do this, instead of updating it ad-hoc from button handlers.
By doing this you won't need to remember to update the ui from so many places.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, use more pure functions when you can to avoid keeping track of all this state. Store the state in plain old objects instead. Only store the state you need, the ui should compute its result from it.</p>

<p>Some inspiration:</p>

<pre><code>state = intitialState

updateGame(event){
    state = handleEvent(state, event)
    state = updateState(state)
    updateUi(state)
}

onButton(event){
    updateGame(event)
}
</code></pre>

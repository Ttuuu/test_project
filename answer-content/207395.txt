<h2>Include order :</h2>

<p><strike>You completely reversered order of includes.</strike>  You could include standard header first, then 3rd party header and finally yours. <a href="https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/issues/981" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Here's the two way</a> and the explanation.</p>

<h2>Raw pointer</h2>

<p>You use <code>std::unique_ptr</code> for some widget but not for all nor for <code>ui</code>, why? If you do, you don't want to delete <code>ui</code> anymore thanks to RAII.</p>

<h2>Use name that makes sense</h2>

<p>Try to use full name, eg: <code>curIsNoCat</code> can be renamed to <code>hasNoCategory</code></p>

<h2>Comments/code ratio</h2>

<p>When you have too much comment comparing to your code, that is because your code isn't explicit by itself, so what it do is not enought obvious.</p>

<p>Code style is not the problem. The expectation is that a new coder uses the in house style guides when writing.</p>

<p>I think the problem is that you missed an important assumption. </p>

<p>The test case passes one argument, however that does not mean that the function you are given will have only one argument.</p>

<p>Thus maybe (I am just guessing) if you wrote... </p>

<pre><code>const alternate = fn =&gt; {
    let odd = false;
    return (...args) =&gt; (odd = !odd) ? fn(...args) : undefined;
};
</code></pre>

<p>Also though not stated there could have been an expectation that it not throw on bad input. Thus first vet the input function.</p>

<pre><code>const alternate = fn =&gt; {
    let odd = false;
    return typeof fn === "function" ?
        (...args) =&gt; odd = !odd ? fn(...args) : undefined :
        () =&gt; {};
}
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>function alternate (fn) {
    if (typeof fn === "function") {
        let odd = false;
        return (...args) =&gt; odd = !odd ? fn(...args) : undefined;
    }
    return () =&gt; {};
}
</code></pre>

<p>As the documentation does not say anything about throwing an error the safer bet is to silently deal with bad input</p>

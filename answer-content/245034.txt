<h2>URL</h2>
<p>URL components should generally appear from "broadest to narrowest" left-to-right. I'm not totally convinced that this is currently the case - the weather site is probably "broader" than the latitude and longitude.</p>
<p>Is the city within a climbing area, or vice versa? If a climbing area is within (or smaller than) a city, their positions should be reversed.</p>

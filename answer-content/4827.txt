<p>This looks fine to me although you may want to extract it out in to a separate class if it  starts to get bigger. I usually end up with an Init (or similar) folder with classes for IOC, ORM, Mapper and Routes (if they get big enough). Once out of the Global.asax you can test them if needed as well (not required for basic mappings in your example of course).</p>

<p>Rename it to <code>RegisterViewMapper()</code> or similar and it will smell less.</p>

<p>Some comments about things that you said in the question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"First I solved this using Scanner. But this solutions seems to be slow, cause IO was blocking."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are reading from a file, I/O will not be blocking.   It is possible that Scanner is using a buffer that is too small, but I think that is unlikely.  You were probably doing something else wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"I think solution is good (but not sure). Is there any other optimization techniques I've ignored?"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using streams is not an optimization technique.  Accepted wisdom is that using streams is currently <em>a bit</em> slower than an equivalent algorithm implemented using loops.  The real advantage of streams is that they are simpler to write and understand than old-fashioned loops, especially when the transformation is complex.  For example, you have implemented your problem with just two statements.</p>

<p>Not that I would rewrite your code.  It is rarely worthwhile rewriting code to get a small performance boost.  Developer time is more precious than computer time.</p>

<p>Here's the real problem.  Too many cookies are bad for your health.  Black coffee with no sugar is a much better aid for programming ... and it is better for your waistline and your teeth :-)</p>

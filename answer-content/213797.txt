<p>You do a lot of tests. It would be simplier if you implement a few objects containing your different values and you just display these values.</p>

<p>You'd have to do enough objects to cover all cases but you limit the tests to the minimum this way.</p>

<p>Example :</p>

<pre><code>// I won't print every cases but you got the idea
let dayOfWeekWhenNoMonthIsSpecified = {
    '*' : 'every day', '0' : 'on Sundays', '1' : 'on Mondays',
    '0,6' : 'on weekends', '1-5' : 'on weekdays'
};

cronToString = "Runs " + dayOfWeekWhenNoMonthIsSpecified[cron[4]];
</code></pre>
    </div>

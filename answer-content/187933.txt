<h2>Playability</h2>

<p>For a game of 2048, I would expect that at least all of the tiles up to 2048 would have distinct colors.</p>

<p>The animation for each move is extremely annoying and confusing:</p>

<ul>
<li>The sliding movement is usually too slow, but is sometimes fast.</li>
<li>The result of two equal tiles colliding should result in a merged tile, but the merged tile <em>appears instantaneously, before</em> the sliding animation completes.</li>
<li>The random new tile usually appears before the sliding is complete.  This often results in tiles sliding "underneath" the new tile.</li>
</ul>

<p>When a new tile appears, it has value 2, 4, or 8 with equal probability.  In an authentic 2048 game, it's usually 2, and occasionally 4, but never 8.</p>

<p>The "Game over" condition should be detected as soon as the board is full and no move is possible.  You shouldn't have to wait until the user tries to make the next move.</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>The <code>Cell</code> class is misnamed; its name seems to refer to one of the fixed positions of the board, but actually refers to one of the movable items.  In English, <code>Tile</code> would be a more appropriate name.</p>

<p>Using a UUID for each <code>Cell</code> object seems like overkill.  Generating the <code>id</code> from a global counter (perhaps from an <code>itertools.count()</code>) would suffice.</p>

<p>Mapping left, right, down, and up to the numbers 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and having <code>App.callback()</code> map those numbers back to the methods <code>._left()</code>, <code>._right()</code>, <code>._down()</code>, and <code>._up()</code> is a pointless use of magic numbers.  You could have represented the four directions as strings, and performed a method lookup based on the name.</p>

<p>Those four methods for moving cells in each direction are extremely similar to each other.  They should be refactored to call a common handler that accepts (Δx, Δy) as parameters.</p>

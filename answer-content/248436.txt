<p>Nice, one of my favorite games.</p>
<p>What you got now is all the responsibilities of a program mixed together into same classes merrily violating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle" rel="nofollow noreferrer">single responsibility principle</a>. Study the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller" rel="nofollow noreferrer">MVC</a> model. Then start by separating your game physics into their own set of classes and the graphical representation to another set. Put the key and action listeners into their own classes and create a main class that connects all the components together.</p>
<p>Move all the magic numbers (such as screen size) into variables so that you can change them easily. Make the object sizes relative to the screen size so that you can scale the game for different screen resolutions. Take into account that not all screens have the same width to height aspect ratio.</p>
<p>Avoid arbitrary abbreviations like <code>posun</code>. What is a posun?</p>

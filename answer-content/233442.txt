<pre><code>String h = human == 1 ? "ROCK" : human == 2 ? "PAPER" : "SCISSORS";

<p>This line is duplicated and can be converted into a method.</p>

<pre><code>System.out.println("Computer Won : " + computerScore);
System.out.println("Human Chose " + h + " and Computer Chose " + c);
</code></pre>

<p>and </p>

<pre><code>System.out.println("Human Won : " + humanScore);
System.out.println("Human Chose " + h + " and Computer Chose " + c);
</code></pre>

<p>have very similar logic, and can be refactored into another method where the differing strings can be substituted.</p>

<pre><code>((computer == ROCK &amp;&amp; human == SCISSORS) || (computer == PAPER &amp;&amp; human == ROCK) || (computer == SCISSORS &amp;&amp; human == PAPER))
</code></pre>

<p>This comparison check is duplicated twice, and could be refactored into another method.</p>

<p>Each player has three properties: a name, score, and current move and needs to know if another move beats theirs. This can be converted into a <code>Player</code> class and the <code>beats(x, y)</code> comparison can be done there so that <code>human.beats(computer)</code> can be run. This makes it easier to read as there is more English.</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++) {
    System.out.println("------------------------------");
}
</code></pre>

<p>This loop can be replaced with a <code>.repeat(n)</code> invocation, which duplicates the string four times.</p>

<pre><code>while (human != -1) {
</code></pre>

<p>This could be converted into a <code>while true</code> loop and then this condition can be specified as <code>if (human == -1) break</code> which simplifies the control flow.</p>

<pre><code>ROCK IS 1 :: PAPER IS 2 :: SCISSORS 3
</code></pre>

<p>It is unclear that the user has to enter in -1 to end the program. Perhaps the message could be added here.</p>

<p>Applying these suggestions, I get the following code:</p>

<p>Shouldn't the 'IsValid' method be static? I suppose you use it like <code>Rule.IsValid(calculatedCompensation, 0, Rule.CompensationIsZero.Id)</code>, (as general idea, obviously it can be simplified).</p>

<p>Anyway PERSONALLY I would not do this, because <code>Rule</code> is no more an <code>Enum</code>, you gave it logic, that usually <code>Enum</code> don't have. I would have keep the <code>Enum</code> as original and built on top of that a <code>Class</code> with the required logic. (Maybe called <code>RuleValidator</code> with a static method <code>public static bool IsValid(Rule rule, decimal compensation, decimal demand) {...}</code>.</p>

<p>If this does not concern you, than another way could be to write an extension method:</p>

<pre class="lang-cs prettyprint-override"><code>static class RuleExtensions 
{
  public static bool Validate(this Rule rule, decimal compensation, decimal demand) 
  {
    switch (rule) 
    {
      case None: return true;
      case CompensationIsZero: return compensation == 0;
      case CompensationLessThanDemand : return compensation &lt; demand;
      // ecc...
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

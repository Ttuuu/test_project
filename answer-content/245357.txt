<p>To add to "Your Common Sense" answer:</p>
<ol>
<li>I would suggest that the next step would be to separate your HTML and PHP code.</li>
</ol>
<p>i.e. moving out the logic for account closure into its own class since you might want to use that logic elsewhere. (DRY Principle)</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>It's best to let JS/HTML handle redirects too since that is something related to the front end facing application.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In a larger application, speed is of the essence and every data byte may count, due to which I would suggest declaring variables only when and where you need them.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>i.e.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>$userLoggedIn</code> is used within an if statement, yet it was declared outside of an if statement.</li>
<li><code>$userLoggedIn</code> is used only once. The question to ask is - does having this variable improve the readability of my code? If not, then just use <code>$_SESSION['thesocial_username']</code>.</li>
</ul>

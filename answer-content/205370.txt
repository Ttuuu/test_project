<p>The problem's definition doesn't specify that the answer should be in C++.  You can get the answer in less than a second with the following Unix shell pipeline one-liner.</p>

<pre><code>$ time grep -v '[gkmqvwxz]' words.txt | awk '{print length($1), $1}' | sort -rn | head -1

31 dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane

real    0m0.960s
</code></pre>

<p>Here are the commands explained one-by-one. The commands are connected into a <em>pipeline</em> so that the output of each command is filtered by the next one.</p>

<pre><code># Remove lines containing any of the disallowed characters
grep -v '[gkmqvwxz]' words.txt |
# Prefix each word by its length
awk '{print length($1), $1}' |
# Order the output numerically in reverse order
sort -rn |
# Output first line
head -1
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, you might want to write this in a scripting language, which, compared to the C++ implementation, is almost as concise and also executes faster.</p>

<p><strong>awk</strong></p>

<pre><code>$ time awk '!/[gkmqvwxz]/ &amp;&amp; length($1) &gt; max_length {result = $1; max_length = length($1); } END {print result}' words.txt
dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane

real    0m0.180s
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Perl</strong></p>

<pre><code>$ time perl -ne ' if (!/[gkmqvwxz]/ &amp;&amp; length($_) &gt; $max_length) {$result = $_; $max_length = length($_); } END {print $result}' words.txt
dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane

real    0m0.371s

<p>Less code means fewer possibilities for bugs and significantly less effort from your part. Nowadays in most cases it's better to optimize for readability and developer effort rather than for CPU efficiency.</p>

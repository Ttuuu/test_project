<p>Something is missing in your question: does a duplicate entry is an <strong>error</strong> or a <strong>special case</strong>? This is the only question you should ask yourself.</p>

<p>If duplicates are not expected, use an exception (and don't catch it at this level). Performance is not an issue when an error occurs.</p>

<p>Otherwise, don't use exceptions. This would deceive other developers (they will think that a duplicate IS an error). It would also bother them each time they'll ask Visual Studio to stop on each exception.</p>

<p>Just some general thoughts since I am not familiar with the ECM algorithm you are using:</p>

<p>The standard implementation of Python is interpreted. The Python executive is switched to for every line of your source.  Thus idiomatic Python will use Numpy or other libraries to express the algorithm as calls to matrix routines or as operations on complex values or quaternions. Thus the interpreter is called less often and code spends more of its time running in compiled routines.  In contrast your code looks more like Fortran.</p>

<p>Other options are using Cython, which compiles Python to machine code, and writing compiled functions for routines that are called often inside loops.</p>

<p>The standard module <code>profile</code> can tell you how often a line is executed and identify where your code is spending its time.</p>

<p>You don't say which version of Python you are running with, but if you are using a 32 bit version of Python 2 you can get an immediate increase in speed and stability by upgrading to Python 3.</p>

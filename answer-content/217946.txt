<h2>Code format</h2>

<p>Your use of spaces, braces and parantheses is unconventional in some places.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>while( (line = strReadLine(input)) ){
    x++;
    printf("%s\n",line);
    if(x == 300){printf("emergency break\n");break;}
}
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Conventionally this would look more like this:</p>

<pre><code>while (line = strReadLine(input)) {
    x++;
    printf("%s\n", line);
    if (x == 300) {
        printf("emergency break\n");
        break;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You could try using your IDE's auto-format feature and see how it arranges the code. Also you might want to have a look at some C coding conventions that can be found online, to see how people commonly format their C code in a readable way.</p>

<h2>Thread safety</h2>

<p>It seems like you are trying to guard the function against multiple threads executing it at the same time. However, the function's purpose is to read a string line by line, not to write to it. So as long as the function is only reading from its input, there should be no need to prevent multiple concurrent executions.</p>

<p>If multiple threads really did execute it at the same time, you could still get a race condition between checking the variables and overwriting it, and thus not get the error message when you would expect it.</p>

<h2>Abusing booleanness</h2>

<p>When checking whether an integer has the value <code>0</code>, it is more readable if you compare it to 0, as you do in the first of the following two lines. It reads more intuitively, because a length cannot be true or false, as the second line implies, even though the compiler can handle both. Then you also wouldn't need the comment explaining what <code>!length</code> is supposed to mean. <code>if (length == 0)</code> says it explicitly.</p>

<pre><code>if(length == 0 || start == 0) length = strlen(text);
if(!length) return (char*) 0;//the string is 0 length
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Please</strong> improve the variable names - it's not at all obvious what <code>a</code>, <code>k</code> and <code>p</code> are (and conventionally, <code>p</code> is usually used for a small-scope pointer, not an integer).</p>

<p><strong>Always</strong> check whether <code>malloc()</code> (or <code>calloc()</code>, or <code>realloc()</code>) returns a non-null pointer before dereferencing.</p>

<p>The algorithm is so opaque that I'm not going to attempt to unravel it.  It's nowhere near suitable for production use.</p>

<p>BTW, it's misleading to claim that you don't use array indexing when there's clearly <code>*(arr+i)</code> in a couple of places and <code>*(s+p)</code> in a couple more.  Just changing the syntax doesn't stop that being a cheat.</p>

<p>I would recommend using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/middleware/extensibility?view=aspnetcore-2.2" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Factory-based middleware</a> instead of the by-convention method that you share here. You would then be able to have scoped DI.</p>

<p>For string concatenation, consider using a <code>StringBuilder</code> instead of the plus-operator everywhere. I can see you use it in some places, but that string concatenation with interpolation "looks" costly. Refer to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.stringbuilder?view=netframework-4.8#remarks" rel="nofollow noreferrer">remarks section</a> to see if the <code>StringBuilder</code> is a good choice for your use-case.</p>

<p>Experiment with <code>ReadChunkBufferLength</code> and consider making it a configurable value with a sane default. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/780316/optimal-buffer-size-for-response-stream-of-httpwebresponse">This SO post</a> might provide some insight.</p>

<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>I don't like name <code>startTheTransitionAfterTheSplashScreen</code>. Too long, you are already in <code>SplashScreen</code>. Maybe <code>startTransition</code> or <code>startTransitionafter1second</code>.</p>

<p>Using handler is fine, but what if user manages to change orientation during that 1 second? Activity gets destroyed and recreated. Now you have 2 active handlers and I expect <code>ActivityJustAfterSplashScreen</code> will be called 2 times.</p>

<p>I suggest keeping reference to handler so that you can cancel in <code>onDestroy</code> - <code>handler.removeCallbacksAndMessages(null)</code>.</p>

<p>You are not using any stored data in the <code>RevereseString</code> [sic] object, so you do not actually need to create the object.  Changing <code>reverseStr()</code> to a <code>static</code> method, (optionally <code>private</code> as well) and you can remove <code>RevereseString reverseStr = new RevereseString();</code> to save one line of code.</p>

<p>There is no need for a <code>midIndex</code>.  You just need to reverse characters until the <code>startIndex</code> and <code>lastIndex</code> meet or cross.  Thus you can remove <code>int midIndex = 0 + (oldArray.length - 0)/2 ;</code> and save another line of code.</p>

<p>Finally, you are not returning a new array; you are returning the original <code>oldArray</code> and assigning that object to <code>newArray</code>.  In other words, as <code>main()</code> finishes, <code>oldArray == newArray</code> is <code>true</code>.  You have reversed the <code>oldArray</code> in place; there is no need for a return value from <code>reverseStr()</code>, so you can eliminate at least another two lines of code.</p>

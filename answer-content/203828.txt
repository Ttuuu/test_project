<li><p>It's very surprising that your custom exception-class can throw an exception for anything but original creation. <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/support.exception" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>std::exception</code> and derived standard classes aren't allowed to do that.</a></p></li>
<li><p>Is it actually significant whether the object stores a stack-trace at all? Most likely not. So, consider simply modifying the passed message instead of creating your own classes. That calls for a (potentially templated) function instead.</p></li>
<li><p>As-is, you store the original message, and then try to store the enhanced message and a flag that the enhanced message exists (which is equivalent to not being empty, so why a flag???) <em>and should be used instead</em>. That's a waste.</p></li>

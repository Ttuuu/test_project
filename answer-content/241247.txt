<p>The first step of optimization is to remove the duplicate call to triangulated.</p>

<p>The second step of optimization is to pick only the factors that are the divisors and ignore the numbers that aren't.</p>

<p>Start from the reverse in the second function loop, if there is a divisor from reverse, all the factors of that divisor will definitely be a divisor, so find and all of them, so you can skip them in the loop.
Eg, if you start the loop from 200, then all the factors of 200, (100, 50, 25, 4...) can be ignored by adding them to a set. 
In further loops do it only for the numbers that aren't present in this set.
This technique is what is followed in "Seive of Erastosthenes".</p>

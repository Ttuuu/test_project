<p>I realized that deactivating <code>rnu</code> when I start <code>:Termdebug</code> is unproductive, as the option remains inactive even when I'm navigating the scripts while the <code>!gdb</code> window is open.</p>
<p>So I ended up with this solution, where <code>rnu</code> is off only if the cursor is in the <code>!gdb</code> window; as soon as the cursor moves away from it, <code>rnu</code> is turned on.</p>
<pre><code>" mapping and function to start gdb and activate "smart" relativenumber
nnoremap &lt;silent&gt; &lt;Leader&gt;td :call TermdebugAndRelNumOff()&lt;CR&gt;
function! TermdebugAndRelNumOff()
  augroup ClosingDebugger
    au!
    " set/unset rnu when leaving/entering gdb window
    autocmd BufLeave  !gdb call SetRelNumInAllWin(1)
    autocmd BufEnter  !gdb call SetRelNumInAllWin(0)
    " delete the augroup (and its autocmd-s) when closing gdb
    autocmd BufUnload !gdb au! | augroup! ClosingDebugger
  augroup END
  " start Termdebug
  Termdebug
endfunction
</code></pre>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong></p>
<p>The use of <code>windo</code> has the undesirable behavior of altering the window which <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd> will jump to: once I move <em>to</em> the <code>!gdb</code> window from <code>ThisWindow</code>, those keys will jump to the bottom-right window instead of to <code>ThisWindow</code>. I'm trying to address this annoying thing <a href="https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/26852/how-can-i-alter-the-window-to-which-ctrlp-will-jump-to">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE2</strong></p>
<p>Since moving away from the <code>!gdb</code> window makes no sense if that window is not in the current tab, and since moving to it from a tab which does not contain it is unlikely (or is it non-sense too?), I suspect that <code>tabdo</code> can be avoided entirely in the definition of <code>SetRelNumInAllWin</code> given in the question.</p>

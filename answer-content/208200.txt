<p>I'd expect to see many more tests of any program that addresses a problem as gnarly as parsing a C++ declaration.</p>

<p>Choosing a couple I've recently had cause to write (on Stack Overflow), I would immediately add</p>



<ul>
<li><pre class="lang-c++ prettyprint-override"><code>void (SENDER::*get_func())(double, double);
</code></pre>

(from <a href="//stackoverflow.com/a/53390003"><em>Passing pointers to member function as returned values to <code>QObject::connect()</code></em></a>)</li>
<li><pre class="lang-c++ prettyprint-override"><code>constexpr std::size_t len(const T(&amp;)[length]);
</code></pre>

(from <a href="//stackoverflow.com/a/53409160"><em>Differentiate between array and pointer as function parameter</em></a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Neither of these succeeded when I tried them.</p>

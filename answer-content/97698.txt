<p>There are 6 global variables in your file. Considering a simple app that is 10x the lines of code of this, you would have written 60 global variables. Each global variable by definition can be modified from anywhere in the code. This is impossible to keep track of. Each function should be as pure as possible, taking input and giving output not caring of the state of the world.</p>

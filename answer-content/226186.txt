<p>The main problem with your code is that your methods are using the global variables <code>c,p,m</code>. </p>

<p>Firstly, these variable names could use a little love, naming them <code>cards, probabilities</code>and <code>money</code> would be useful, but I'd go one step farther and try to find better class names for those three classes. I'd expect a class <code>Cards</code> to represent a pack of cards, not the hands of two different players. The point is : When naming a class, ask yourself what that class represents and name it this way. Otherwise, it makes the code difficult to understand.</p>

<p>Second of all, I think you should either encapsulate this code in a <code>class</code> where <code>c,p,m</code> would be member variables (<code>self.p, self.m, self.c</code>), which would make it clearer the variables have already been declared and are supposed to be used. Otherwise, you have methods that can't be called before the three global variables have been initialized and while this works in your current situation, if you were to move your code a little bit it might break, which is a pretty big code smell.</p>

<p>Apart from those two points, I think your code is great.</p>

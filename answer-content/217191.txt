<p>It appears that you built and tested this code on a system using ASCII or similar encoding.  Codings other than ASCII will cause you problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>Encodings that are supersets of ASCII have more characters that match <code>isalpha()</code> (e.g. in Latin-1, <code>Ã </code> is an alphabetic character).</li>
<li>Other encodings have different numeric values for <code>a</code>, <code>A</code> and the other values you've written as integer literals.</li>
<li>Some encodings (notably EBCDIC) don't have contiguous alphabetic runs, so performing arithmetic on characters won't give the results you want.</li>
<li><code>isalpha()</code> and related functions have undefined behaviour when passed negative values (in this code, that can happen on systems where <code>char</code> is a signed type).</li>
</ul>

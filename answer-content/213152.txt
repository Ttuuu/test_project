<h3>Easter: Leap Year Check Is Redundant</h3>

<p>Given that it is easy to calculate whether a year is a leap year, any performance loss from re-calculating it will be miniscule compared to the risk of the two being inconsistent.</p>

<h3>Easter: DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)</h3>

<p>There are several places which, essentially, amount to this:</p>

<pre><code>return isLeapYear ? (stuff) + 1 : (stuff)
</code></pre>

<p>It would reduce the amount of repetition by calculating as if it weren't a leap year, then adding an extra day if necessary.</p>

<h3>What First Day Of Year?</h3>

<p>Isn't this always January 1st?  I can't work out what it is calculating.  Consider renaming it.</p>

<h3>XMLInterior: Revisit Your Fields</h3>

<p>Fields are meant to be used across calls to various methods of an object.  In your case, most of the fields set by <code>newDocumentXML</code> won't be accessible.  These should be passed around as parameters and return values instead.</p>

<h3>XMLInterior: What are these holidays?</h3>

<p>It would make this code a lot clearer to have methods that tested each holiday, such as <code>isNewYearsDay(date)</code>.</p>

<h3>XMLMarker: Consider using NIO methods for creating directories</h3>

<p>Methods in <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/Files.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>java.nio.Files</code></a> throw exceptions on failure, rather than returning a boolean to indicate success or not.  These will make the code significantly cleaner.</p>

<p>The final column's call to <code>MATCH()</code> is triggering some slowdown. The <code>0</code> parameter forces a linear search, so the whole thing takes time proportional to n^2 where n is the number of elements. This needs to be avoided. The list of count in column G (or wherever you put it, if you got them combined) is in monotonically increasing order, so it is permissible to use <code>1</code> or <code>true</code> as the third parameter to <code>SEARCH()</code>, causing it to perform a binary search -- but unfortunately it might pick any element with that value. In order to end up at the right spot, take advantage of the other feature of binary search: it picks the latest value less than or equal to the searched item. Tweak the value slightly and end up at the right spot!</p>

<pre><code>=IF(ROWS($G$3:G3)&lt;=MAX($G$3:$G$1000),
 INDEX($E$3:$E$22,1+IFERROR(MATCH(ROWS($G$3:G3)-0.5,$G$3:$G$22,1),0)),"")
</code></pre>

<p>This depends on a helper cell somewhere else, named <code>MaxOfColumnG</code>, which is just the <code>=MAX($G$3:$G$1000)</code> or whatever.</p>

<p>How it works: The list in column G ("third column") is something like</p>

<pre><code>0
0
0
1
1
1
2
2
3
4
</code></pre>

<p>The formula in <strong>H3</strong> wants to find the first <code>1</code>. So we search for <code>0.5</code>. We find the largest value less than or equal to <code>0.5</code>, which ends up being the last <code>0</code>. Add on one more and we're at the right place. I had to change the <code>IFERROR</code> to an <code>IF</code> but we already know the max-index. In addition, the <code>IF()</code> will short-circuit and not perform the <code>MATCH()</code> unless it is necessary.</p>

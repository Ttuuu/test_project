<p>Implementing both Iterable and Iterator at the same time is a bit weird choice and while the API documentation for Iterator makes no claims about the implementation, I think most people would assume that subsequent calls to iterator() return a different object each time and those objects, if used for reading only, do not interfere with each other.</p>

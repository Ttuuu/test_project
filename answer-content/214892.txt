<p>Some suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Running this code through a linter such as <a href="https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8" rel="nofollow noreferrer">flake8</a> will give you some hints towards producing more idiomatic code. You can also use <a href="https://github.com/ambv/black" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Black</a> to automatically format your code to be more idiomatic.</li>
<li>You don't need to assign <code>obj1</code> in <code>main</code> - the variable is unused.</li>
<li><code>main_menu</code> taking a bunch of strings and numbers makes the call completely unintelligible on its own. If you were to instead create a <code>Customer</code> with an <code>Account</code>, <code>Identification</code> and <code>BankCard</code> instead, the meaning of the now single parameter would be obvious.</li>
<li><code>fetchone</code> does not assert that there is only one record. You should make sure to check that whenever you use it outside of a loop you <code>assert</code> that there are no more rows after retrieving it. Otherwise you can very easily get into situations where business rules such as having only one code per card is broken.</li>
<li>Optional parameters are a code smell. That doesn't mean they are always bad, but they are very often a sign that the code needs some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it" rel="nofollow noreferrer">YAGNI</a> love. In your case you never call <code>main_menu</code> without <code>card_no</code>, so it should not be optional.</li>
</ul>

  <p>this sounded like <code>IComparable&lt;T&gt;</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it's not. <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/43hc6wht">The documentation of <code>Compare()</code></a> states that the relation has to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_relation">transitive</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If <code>A.CompareTo(B)</code> returns a value <em>x</em> that is not equal to zero, and <code>B.CompareTo(C)</code> returns a value <em>y</em> of the same sign as <em>x</em>, then <code>A.CompareTo(C)</code> is required to return a value of the same sign as <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn't true in your case, which means that your types shouldn't implement <code>IComparable&lt;T&gt;</code> and that ideally, the comparing method shouldn't be called <code>CompareTo()</code> to avoid confusion.</p>

<p>The problem is that you are erasing elements from <code>prog</code> and then without bounds checking access it with <code>prog[j]</code>. That is sure to fall over.</p>

<p>Your <code>end_time</code> function is commonly known as <code>operator&lt;</code> So you should use the appropriate name.</p>

<p>There is no comment on the significance of <code>1</code> and why a program should not be reordered when it starts at <code>1</code>. It seems that different programs with starting time <code>1</code> should still have an ordering.</p>

<p>You are inconsistent in your loops. Once goes from <code>1</code> to <code>&lt;= participants</code> the other goes from <code>0</code> to <code>&lt; participants</code>. The latter is the commonly used one.</p>

<p>The first loop seems to sort for start time? You can achieve the same if you create a proper <code>operator&lt;</code>.</p>

<p><code>using namespace std;</code> is bad practice. There is no benefit to it other that you do not really know what is standard and what not, which is actually bad. Also it isprone to name clashes. Use what you need and not everything <code>C++</code> has in the box</p>

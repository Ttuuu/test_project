<p><strong>A bit of honesty</strong></p>

<p>When starting to review your code, I found it unintelligible and I was unable to follow the logic. I was able to understand what you are trying to do but not your implementation so I will post a few improvements here. </p>

<p><strong>Structure</strong></p>

<p>There is no need for the <code>for</code> loop in the body. You can see this as you do not use the value you gain from the interand. Because of this, we can cut the loop out. </p>

<p><strong>.lower()</strong></p>

<p>We can strip checking for a lowercase or uppercase answer by using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/stdtypes.html#str.lower" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>.lower()</code></a>. This takes a string and returns the all lowercase equivalent. This means we can strip the user input check to: <code>if start.lower() == "y":</code></p>

<p><strong>Walrus operator</strong></p>

<p>New in Python 3.8 is the <a href="https://realpython.com/lessons/assignment-expressions/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">walrus operator</a>! It looks like this <code>:=</code>. We can use this in the <code>while</code> loop as it can handle prompting the user to quit. We can combine this with the <code>.lower()</code> to simplify the while loop.</p>

<p><strong>Unused import</strong></p>

<p>Despite importing <code>random.seed</code> you never use it, we can remove it from the imports. </p>

<p><strong>Final code</strong></p>

<pre><code>from random import randint
dice = [
[[1],[2],[3]],
[[4],[5],[6]],
[[7],[8],[9]]
]

def diceroll():
    """Loop over dice and print the value"""
    start = input("do you want to play dice Y/N ")
    if start.lower() == "y":
        print(dice[0])
        print(dice[1])
        print(dice[2])

        while (x := input("Do you want to roll the dice?  [y/n]: ").lower()) == "y":
            roll=randint(1,9)
            print(roll)
    else:
        print("GoodBye: ")
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Further improvements</strong></p>

<p>The function uses a global variable which is a bad practice, it is much better to give the function the global variable as an argument. I did not know if you wanted the dice array for something else, so I left it as it is. Also I question the need for a dice array in the first place, but again, this is your code with your own spec.</p>

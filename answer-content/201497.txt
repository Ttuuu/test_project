<p>First thing that feels off is that you're mixing using var together with let and const (check here: <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/274342/is-there-any-reason-to-use-the-var-keyword-in-es6">var in es-6</a>)</p>

<p>As for names of variables, don't be afraid to make them a bit more descriptive. For example "equals" doesn't explain much. If variable is a boolean it's a common practice to name them starting with "is" (isEqual can be true or false and it's indicated just by looking at variables name). You also should say what equals to what, that would explain more.</p>

<p>It would be also good to avoid nesting so many if statements.</p>

<p>Oh, and remember to remove all console.logs in the final version</p>

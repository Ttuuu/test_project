<p>Readability-wise, this is fine, though I prefer <code>ConsoleForegroundBrush</code>, because it keeps the theme of Drawing library, which is well known, and in the real world, you can definitely destroy/dispose brushes / put them down, but disposing an actual colour would be like... changing the color of the text back to black?</p>

<p>The main issue is there is a performance impact that comes with <code>using</code>, as this is really a <code>try</code>/<code>finally</code> block under the hood, and so you are adding <code>try</code>/<code>finally</code> around your code which may slow things down unnecessarily, particularly if there's other non-console logic in the using block. </p>

<p>The using block can also sometimes hide other errors, because it's a <code>try</code>/<code>finally</code> block. If you put a <code>using</code> block inside a <code>try()</code> block and your <code>dispose</code> method of the <code>ConsoleForegroundColour</code> class throws an exception (such as if the Console became null somehow), you will probably only see the <code>Dispose()</code> exception, and not the other exception. This situation is highly unlikely to happen in your class though.</p>

<li>Converting from string to int in your first comprehension isn't needed as you're comparing to a literal anyway.</li>
<li>You can merge the first two comprehensions.</li>
<li>you don't need to return early, as you can default <code>max</code> to 1.</li>
<li>You shouldn't need the <code>8</code> in your format, as it shouldn't matter if there's padding or not, as it'll be filtered anyway.</li>
<li>From Python 3.6 you can use an f-string.</li>
</ol>

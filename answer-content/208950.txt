<p>There's a failing case you might have missed.  If the target number is <em>exactly twice the value of one of the entries</em>, then you'll wrongly return true.</p>

<p>Test case:</p>

<pre><code>anyequalto([5], 10)
</code></pre>

<p>Besides that, try to think of a better name for the function.  Perhaps <code>contains_pair_totalling()</code> as a start?</p>

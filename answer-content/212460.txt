<p>A couple of small things to add:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Maybe not applicable to a timed interview, but inline documentation (<code>///</code>) on public members is always nice, and would help to explain the otherwise vague <code>IsValid</code> method name.</p></li>
<li><p>I'd want to throw an exception if any other character is encountered, since the behaviour is undefined and undocumented. The spec says to assume only <code>()[]{}</code> will appear in the string, which means anyone using it incorrectly (by including such characters) should be informed (maybe they assume it handles <code>&lt;&gt;</code> as well?). If a customer were to depend upon this (undocumented) behaviour of just ignoring such characters, you'd have another undocumented 'feature' to maintain in future (or else an unhappy customer).</p></li>
<li><p>Any reason the method isn't <code>static</code>? Conceptual benefits aside, making it static would make it clear that it's not messing with any state, and makes it easier to use.</p></li>
<li><p>That's a very limited set of test-cases: you don't test for <code>{}</code> at all.</p></li>
</ul>

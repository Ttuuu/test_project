  <p>What do you think about my implementation?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To tell you the truth, I don't think much of your implementation.  Instead of in-place swaps you're creating a bunch of temporary lists and combining them after.  It probably more closely resembles a merge sort than a quick sort.</p>

<p>Creating all those lists and merging them together requires many more iterations than the usual quick sort.</p>

<p>Altogether, it seems to me, that both the time and space complexity is worse than the usual quick sort.</p>

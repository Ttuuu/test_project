<p>There simply aren't enough comments in your code for the average C# developer to grok what's happening quickly. I don't meant to slight a large group of people, but let's face facts here, we live our lives in the wonderful world where memory is managed for us, and pointers are never thought of, excepts in the abstract "classes are reference types" kind of way. Be nice to the Jr. dev that has to read this code 5 years from now. Leave some brief comments about what this code is doing and <em>why</em> you've chosen to use the <code>fixed</code> keyword and raw pointers.</p>

<p>Other than that, it appears to be a sane implementation to me. For what it's worth, it looks very much like an implementation of my own. Personally, I chose to use <code>Marshal</code> for everything so that I didn't I have to compile with the unsafe flag, or declare uses of the methods as <code>unsafe</code>. I can't say if it would perform any better or worse than your implementation in terms of memory or speed. If a safe implementation was just as good, I would prefer it so that the code doesn't leak the the unmanaged memory details up through the abstraction. </p>

<p>I posted <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/136007/structure-to-bytearray-extension">my own implementation for review</a>. It does not require the use of the <code>unsafe</code> keyword and context.</p>

<p>The input asking for which value to delete can/should be placed in a separate function.  Then the function to remove the nodes can take that value as a parameter.</p>

<p>The two <code>malloc</code> calls for <code>temp</code> and <code>curr</code> near the top are completely unnecessary and just leak memory.  You want to remove nodes, so you shouldn't have to allocate any memory.</p>

<p>If your list consists of a single node where <code>val == x</code> (or, more generally, all nodes in the list have that value), your program will crash.</p>

<p>If the last node in the list matches the value (and there are other nodes that don't), you'd be leaking that node except that you will be stuck in an infinite loop.  You shouldn't need to handle the last node any differently than removing any other node.</p>

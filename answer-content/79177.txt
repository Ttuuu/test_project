<p>Using <code>package com.areacalculator</code> implies that the domain <em>areacalculator.com</em> is under the control of the programmer or the organization for whom the code was written[1]. The idea is to produce unique Java namespaces by leveraging the uniqueness of internet domain names.</p>

<p>It's a convention designed for the age of the internet and a sound strategy for avoiding namespace conflicts. It makes assigning responsibility a more reasoned process: only one or none of the packages can be named correctly.</p>

<p>[1] <em>Clearly I have assumed that the author of the review code does not control the domain. My apologies if I am in error. The bases for this assumption were the standard parking content currently on the domain and the shape of the code relative to the shape of code expected when serving of area calculations from a website.</em></p>

<p>There's not much to say about your answer, it looks fine! One could quibble over the names of variables, maybe <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> could be named <code>left_sum</code> and <code>right_sum</code> for example, and you could've used <code>auto</code> for the type of those two variables. But other than that I think there is nothing that can be improved.</p>

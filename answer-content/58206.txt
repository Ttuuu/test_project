<p>Yes it is perfectly valid.</p>

<p>lambdas in C++ were designed to be functionally equivalent to functors that were used a lot in C++03.</p>

<p>So you can consider:</p>

<pre><code>auto x = [state1, state2](Param1 param1, Param2 param2){/* Do Stuff */};
</code></pre>

<p>To be functionally equivalent to:   </p>

<pre><code>struct AnonClassX
{
    State1  state1;
    State2  state2;
    AnonClassX(State1 state1, State2 state2)
       : state1(state1)
       , state2(state2)
    {}
    returnValue operator()(Param1 param1, Param2 param2) const
    {
         /* Do Stuff */
    }
};
AnonClassX   x(state1,state2);
</code></pre>

<p>It is quite normal to use static variables in functions and methods. Lambda is just a shorthand for creating an anonymous class with state and an <code>operator()()</code> to make it act like a function. So it should be very normal to put static members inside it.</p>

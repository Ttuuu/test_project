  <p>I placed the if condition for checking lengths at the top even before the index definitions because I figured that if they aren't even the same size, why bother with doing anything else. Is that weird?</p>

<p>No I don't think that is weird. I would consider it a good optimization.</p>

<p>Personally I think the code is mostly fine, a good starting point would be to Google some examples on how to merge sub-arrays since that is fairly similar.</p>

<p>My one question would be why you started at the end of the array and merged them in descending order. That is kind of strange to me. I would do it in ascending order. I would also use a <code>for</code> loop instead of a <code>while</code> loop. </p>

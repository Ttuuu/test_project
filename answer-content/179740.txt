<p>Don't make member fields const. This creates issues when you go and copy an object. Just drop the const on the fields and instead pass const ref around if something needs a view.</p>

<p>You make a very strict statement about indentation (spaces only and 4 at a time) and whitespace. Instead you can follow python's scheme: if new line is longer then prefix must be exactly equal to the previous line's indentation (push current to stack). If shorter then look backwards in the indentation stack until you find a match and pop until that point. Number of indentation tokens is equal to the size of the stack. </p>

<p>You don't have any way to express escaped characters in your string literals.</p>

<p>Is would also consider adding offsets in the line for each token. Having error into down to the proper token is much easier for the user than only the line. especially when they go for obtuse one-liners.</p>

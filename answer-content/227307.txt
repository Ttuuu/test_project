<h1>Stop hammering XKCD server</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>You basically wrote a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack" rel="noreferrer">denial-of-service attack</a>, since you try to connect as fast and as often as possible to the server.</p></li>
<li><p>By sharing this code on CodeReview, it becomes a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack#Distributed_DoS" rel="noreferrer">distributed denial-of-service</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Just in case it wasn't clear : don't do that.</p>

<p>I suppose the load of XKCD servers is high enough that your code won't make any noticeable difference. Still, the primary goal of your code should be to stay under the radar. Seen from outside, there shouldn't be any difference between launching your script and casually browsing <a href="https://xkcd.com/" rel="noreferrer">https://xkcd.com/</a>.</p>

<p>It isn't just as a courtesy to fellow developers : you might be banned by the remote servers if you send too many requests too fast.</p>

<h1>Solutions</h1>

<ul>
<li>Wait at least one second before downloading any picture. The desired pause might be defined as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard#Crawl-delay_directive" rel="noreferrer"><code>Crawl-delay</code></a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard" rel="noreferrer"><code>robots.txt</code></a>.</li>
<li>Remove multi-threading or at least limit the number of threads.</li>
<li>Don't download a file again if it is already in <code>SAVE_DIRECTORY</code>. You can check if it's here, if its size is larger than <code>0</code> or if it is indeed a PNG file.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Unrelated note</h1>

<p>You know the id for each comic. You should probably write it in the filename : <code>geologic_time.png</code> could be called <code>2187_geologic_time.png</code> or <code>02187_geologic_time.png</code>.</p>

<p>This way, comics are sorted chronologically inside <code>SAVE_DIRECTORY</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Weak EPS test</strong></p>

<p>The following is only useful for differences on a narrow power-of-2 range.  This approach is taking the float out of floating point.</p>

<pre><code>if (fabs(x - prev) &lt; eps)  // weak
</code></pre>

<p>When <code>x, prev</code> are small like 10e-10 the result is always true.  Not useful to find the of sqrt(10e-20).</p>

<p>When <code>x, prev</code> are large like 10e+12 the result may never be true as the large difference wobbles around 0.0.</p>

<p>Instead with <em>floating point</em>, this nearness test needs to consider the magnitudes of <code>x, prev</code>.</p>

<p>Something like <code>fabs(x - prev)/fabs(x + prev) &lt;  eps</code> can make sense - with additional code to protect against division by zero and overflow.</p>

<p>This is a deep subject and better tests exist.  Usually what is best is depends on the situation.</p>

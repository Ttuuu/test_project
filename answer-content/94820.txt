<li><p>I know, that you know, that your code is messy, but I'm still going to give some tips on your coding style. Here are a few tips I have on what can be improved there.</p>

<ol>
<li>Don't use <code>%</code> for string formatting, as it is deprecated. You should be using <code>str.format()</code> instead. Here's an example: <code>print "Hello {0}".format("world")</code></li>
<li>You can remove the docstring at the end of your file containing <code>"""!@endcond"""</code>. This does nothing, and serves no purpose.</li>
<li>Separate this out into different functions. In it's current state, it's really hard to read as one large block of code.</li>
<li>Add more comments. Comments will make your code much clearer, and easier to read. Functions and classes should use docstrings, over regular inline comments.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Don't import multiple modules on one line. If an error occurs with one module, it can be hard to distinguish where the error came from.</p></li>
<li>Some variable names could be better. For example, the names <code>sts</code>, or <code>shp2pgsql</code> provide no useful information. Try to find any other names with not so great names, and see how you can improve them.</li>
<li>I'm not an expert on asynchronous programming, or any of the modules provided in Python made for this, but if you want to do a task like this, Python 3.5 will include the <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> keywords built for asynchronous programming. </li>
</ol>

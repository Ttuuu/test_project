<p><strong>Do one thing</strong></p>

<p>Let's start with your top level:</p>

<pre><code>def count_div_digits(l):
    for number in l:
</code></pre>

<p>Firstly, <code>l</code> is a terrible variable name. It looks like <code>1</code>. Avoid it at all costs. Secondly, this function is less useful than it could be simply because it requires a list of numbers. It'd be better if the function took a single number, then you could call it on a list separately if you want:</p>

<pre><code>def count_div_digits(number):
    ...

for number in lst:
    count_div_digits(number)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Return, don't <code>print</code></strong></p>

<p>Right now, your <code>count_div_digits</code> simply prints its result. That's all well and good, but it'd be better if you just returned the number. If you want to print it, you can always just do:</p>

<pre><code>print count_div_digits(number)
</code></pre>

<p>And this way, you can store the results somewhere else for further analysis later.</p>

<p><strong>Avoid <code>continue</code></strong>:</p>

<p>The less weird hops your loops make, the easier it is to follow along the logic. Right now you have:</p>

<pre><code>if digit=='0':
    continue
else:    
    # stuff
</code></pre>

<p>But it'd be clearer to just do:</p>

<pre><code>if digit != '0':
    # same stuff
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Proposed Solution</strong></p>

<pre><code>def count_div_digits(number):
    count = 0
    for digit in str(number):
        if digit != '0' and number % int(digit) == 0:
            count += 1
    return count
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Generator Expressions</strong></p>

<p>You could also write the above with the help of a generator expression by factoring out a length:</p>

<pre><code>def sizeof(iterable):
    return sum(1 for _ in iterable)

def count_div_digits(number):
    return sizeof(digit for digit in str(number)
                  if digit != '0' and number % int(digit) == 0)
</code></pre>

<p>Whether you consider that an improvement or not is a matter of opinion.    </p>

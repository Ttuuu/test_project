<p>Just to add to the other answers, not sure if you've considered this, but keep in mind that the file name will be the same unless you create a new instance of your class.</p>

<p>That means that if your logger instance is the same across midnight, you'll have the log of things that happened in one day written in the file of the previous day.</p>

<p>Maybe this is actually what you want? Again, not sure. But consider instead something along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>def get_log_filename():
    today = datetime.now().strftime(format="%d-%m-%Y")
    return f"logs/log{today}"

class Logger:
    def log(self, msg):
        with open(get_log_filename(), "a") as file:
            log_type = "INFO".ljust(Logger.PADDING)
            file.write("|{log_type}|{Time.getHour()}:{Time.getMinute()}| {msg}\n")
</code></pre>

<p>Another couple of things that I wanted to mention:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I understand wanting to put docstrings, but they should either be meaningful or not be there at all, otherwise it's just polluting the code. Having a method called <code>clear</code> with a docstring that says <code>clears the logfile</code> isn't really useful.</p></li>
<li><p>I'd also avoid naming a variable <code>type</code>, because not only it's very generic, there's also the built-in function <code>type</code>. The common practice when name clashes happen is to add an underscore at the end (<code>type_</code>), but in this case I think <code>log_type</code> is much better</p></li>
</ul>

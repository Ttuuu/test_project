<p>Fairly simple code.  On thing that caught my eye was the <code>isLeapYear</code> method.  I think the logic would be easier to understand by keeping it in one line:</p>

<pre><code>if((year % 4 == 0 &amp;&amp; year % 100 != 0) || year % 400 == 0){
     return true;
}
</code></pre>
    </div>

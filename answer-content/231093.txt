<p>I like the code, what you can do more is to add interfaces. Lets say Chart can be an interface and RectangularChart implement it and used in your application. In main you will declare variable as Chart and instantiate with RectangularChart.
Also don't be afraid to try to other jobs, if you trust yourself then don't pay attentions to the answer(this can hide other things in back: they like other candidates, they don't like you because you are smart ...).
Think lie this: your story doesn't fit to their story, go on ;)</p>

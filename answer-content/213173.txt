<p>What will happen if another file with the same name already exists?                        This may show interesting error messages that can lead to information disclosure. </p>

<p>Here some suggestions,</p>

<ul>
<li>It is recommended to use an algorithm to determine the filenames. For instance, a filename can be a MD5 hash of the name of file plus the date of the day.</li>
<li>Limit the file size to a maximum value in order to prevent denial of service attacks (on file space or other web applicationâ€™s functions such as the image resizer).</li>
<li>Prevent from overwriting a file in case of having the same hash for both.</li>
<li>Ensure that files with double extensions (e.g. "file.php.txt") cannot be executed especially in Apache.</li>
<li>All the control characters and Unicode ones should be removed from the filenames and their extensions without any exception. Also, the special characters such as ";", ":", "&gt;", "&lt;", "/" ,"\", additional ".", "*", "%", "$", and so on should be discarded as well. If it is applicable and there is no need to have Unicode characters, it is highly recommended to only accept Alpha-Numeric characters and only 1 dot as an input for the file name and the extension; in which the file name and also the extension should not be empty at all (regular expression: [a-zA-Z0-9]{1,200}.[a-zA-Z0-9]{1,10}).</li>
</ul>

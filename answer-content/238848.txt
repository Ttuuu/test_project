<p>There are way too many ways to improve the situation. Some require big changes some require small changes.</p>

<p>Why not simply store the data inside <code>double</code> instead of <code>any</code>? <code>double</code> only fails to 100% accurately contain <code>long long</code> types - but even that happens for very large numbers. At most have <code>long long</code>, <code>double</code> and a boolean that indicates which variable it is. Or say use <code>std::variant&lt;double, long long&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Using <code>std::any</code> for basic types is a total overkill and will surely result in lots of overhead.</p>

<p>The <code>while True</code> is fine, and is probably the best way to do it. However, the rest of the flow control is a bit clumsy.  By rearranging a few statements, you can eliminate the <code>continue</code>s.</p>

<p>PEP 8, the official Python style guide, recommends <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names" rel="noreferrer"><code>lowercase_with_underscores</code> for function names</a> unless you have a good reason to deviate.</p>

<p>The loop to print the numbered menu would be better written using <code>enumerate()</code>.  Also, Python supports double-ended comparisons for validating that the answer is in range.</p>

<pre><code>def multi_choice_question(options: list):
    while True:
        print("\nEnter the number of your choice - ")
        for i, option in enumerate(options, 1):
            print(f'{i}. {option}')
        print("\n")
        try:
            answer = int(input())
            if 1 &lt;= answer &lt;= len(options):
                 return answer
            print("That option does not exist! Try again!")
        except ValueError:
            print("Doesn't seem like a number! Try again!")

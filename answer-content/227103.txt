<p>From the mathematical point , <strong><em>one number is divisible by 3 if sum of its digits is divisible by 3</em></strong> and it is valid the commutative property, so 3 + 6 + 2 is equal to 6 + 3 + 2 because you can commute elements in every position and still obtain the same result.
So if sum of <em>n</em> digits is divisible by 3, the <em>n!</em> permutations of the number including itself are still divisible by 3. Below the execution of algorithm starting from number <code>362</code>:</p>

<ol>
<li>First step: you start from number <code>362</code> and the sum is <code>11</code> that is
not divisible by 3 and so are the commutation of its digits that are
the permutation of the number: the amount of multiples is <code>0</code> and the maximum multiple is <code>None</code>.</li>
<li>Second step: you subtract one digit from number '362'  obtaining numbers <code>62, 32, 36</code>; now there is one number <code>36</code> that is divisible by 3 and its permutations are divisible by 3. In this case there is the permutation <code>63</code> that is the maximum multiple. The amount of multiples is now <code>2</code>.</li>
<li>Third step: you subtract one digit from number <code>36</code> obtaining numbers <code>3</code> and <code>6</code>: both are divisible by <code>3</code> and the final amount of multiples is now <code>4</code>.</li>
</ol>

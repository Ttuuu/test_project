<p>Although tagged <a href="/questions/tagged/bash" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'bash'" rel="tag">bash</a>, this could easily be portable POSIX shell if we use <code>[</code> rather than <code>[[</code>.</p>

<p>Always quote strings containing parameter expansions; even though you might think it unlikely that anyone would invoke the script with <code>$0</code> containing spaces (for example), if you don't code for it, then someone eventually will!</p>

<p>Error messages should always be directed to <code>&amp;2</code>, and error exits should always be non-zero.</p>

<p>Consider using <code>getopt</code> for better argument handling (or at least loop over the arguments and use <code>shift</code> to consume them).  Users don't like having to remember that <code>-o filename</code> has to come after the input file; they are used to commands that accept options in any reasonable order.</p>

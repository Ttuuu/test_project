<p>Instead of indexing to access the rows, you could use iteration:</p>

<pre><code>l = sum(row[i] for i, row in enumerate(matrix))
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of doing two passes over <code>matrix</code> to calculate <code>l</code> and <code>r</code>, you could accumulate the difference in one pass: (note also negative indexing from end of list)</p>

<pre><code>difference = sum(row[i] - row[-i-1] for i, row in enumerate(matrix))
return abs(difference)
</code></pre>

<p>The single-pass approach would also allow you to process input line by line, instead of storing the whole matrix in memory.</p>

<p>The main problem I see with this code is that it's write-only:</p>

<ul>
<li>Single character names. These are deadly to understanding the code.</li>
<li>Over-reliance on regular expressions. These take a long time to read, and in my experience usually hide at least one bug each.</li>
<li>Magical values which should be constants, such as <code>2</code>.</li>
<li>A single variable which is changed several times.</li>
<li>No unit tests, although they may be elsewhere.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other than that, provide <em>one</em> way to run each function. Since you already support providing the same name as the Python function, why not just mandate that and make the code significantly simpler? In fact, why invent your own DSL at all for this problem? Just giving the user a Python shell with mathematical functions already imported should get them 90% of the way there.</p>

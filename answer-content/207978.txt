<p>You can try something along these lines where you nest your formula calls:</p>

<pre><code>Range("F2").FormulaArray = _
    "=IFERROR(" _
        &amp; "INDEX(" _
            &amp; "R2C3:R7C3," _
            &amp; "MATCH(" _
                &amp; "1," _
                &amp; "((R2C1:R7C1=RC5)*(R2C2:R7C2=R1C))," _
                &amp; "0))," _
        &amp; """"")"
</code></pre>

<p>But the way you have it currently is not that bad</p>

<p>Also would highly suggest wrapping code into a <code>With</code> block and adding <code>.</code>'s to your <code>Ranges</code> and <code>Cells</code> to protect against errors from bad references.</p>

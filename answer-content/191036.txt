<p>Do take care to run <code>flake8</code> over the source, and follow its advice.</p>

<p>Array slicing <code>[:max_furnitures]</code> is idiomatic and nice. But if you have a thousand or a million items, you will prefer to use SQL <code>limit</code>, so you don't retrieve a ton of items from the DB only to discard them. You will get a different execution plan from the backend DB if you expose <code>limit 10</code> to its query optimizer.</p>

<p>I see four different max_furnitures parameters. Now maybe this is perfectly nice and we prefer to leave it as is. But also consider introducing it as an attribute used by constructor.</p>

<p>Looks good.</p>

<p>Ship it.</p>

<p>It is hard to tell because the AssetSite enum is small. Is the logic for generating Name is to take the first letter from AssetSite? If so, no need for ifs or switch case. And you don't need to update the function when a new site is added to the enum.</p>
<h1>Error handling</h1>
<p>In general, the creation of class should fail if it's data  is invalid.</p>
<p>Tomorrow you will add more code that use AssetSite, you don't want to handle invalid AssetSite in all the places that use it.</p>
<p>What is the validation for AssetSite? Can it only be only from a closed set of values?
Are you sure  it should be an enum and not a string?</p>
<h1>Conciseness</h1>
<p>Maybe it is a matter of taste, I prefer to call <code>property</code> instead of <code>this.Property</code>.</p>

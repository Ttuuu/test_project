<p>Only use IDs for parts of your page that will be existing in this page only once. For example: <code>&lt;nav id="mainNavigation"&gt;&lt;/nav&gt;</code></p>

<p>An ID like "menu" wouldn't be as good, because you could have multiple menus on your page, that share the same style. But there is only one main navigation.</p>

<p>And always remember: </p>

<p>An element can have only one ID, and every ID is only allowed once on a page!
But an element can have multiple classes and multiple elements can share on class!</p>

<p>For what it's worth, I think your solution is clearer than any of the alternatives posted so far. They are shorter in some cases, but I note that you asked for a <em>better</em> solution, not a shorter one. In this case, I don't believe that brevity is an improvement.</p>

<p>I am not a python programmer, but I can <em>understand</em> your solution. It does what it is supposed to do and it is clear what is happening in each step, and what the result will therefore be. A brief comment at the start of the method explaining what it does might be nice, and perhaps a more descriptive name for the method (although not sure what that would be in this case, since the operation seems rather arbitrary). Other than that, unless other constraints are placed on this method, such as performance, I would not change it. </p>

<p>The only alternative I can see that would be equally readable would be to elide the product variable entirely and simply use return statements, i.e.</p>

<pre><code>if a == b == c:
    return 1
elif a == b:
    return c
elif a == c:
    return b
elif b == c:
    return a

return a * b * c
</code></pre>

<p>However, I do not think this is <em>better</em>, simply different, and as clear. Note that this solution <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4838828/why-should-a-function-have-only-one-exit-point">has more than one exit point</a>, but it is largely a matter of opinion whether that is a bad thing or not, so I will leave that for you to decide.</p>

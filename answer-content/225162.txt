<p>In a circular buffer context, the standard way to avoid busy waiting is to have two semaphores. First to block a producer when a buffer is full, and second to block a consumer when the buffer is empty. Once a process passes its semaphore, and does its job, it should signal the peer.</p>

<hr>

<p>The circular buffer is good when the consumer is only sometimes late <em>and</em> you cannot afford loosing data. In your situation it looks like a wrong solution: the producer becomes throttled by the rate of consumption, and the consumer is a presented with the stale data.</p>

<p>A typical answer is to let the producer run at full speed, and triple-buffer the production (at least, it guarantees that the consumer would get the most recently produced data).

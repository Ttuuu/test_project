<p>Why do you only allow floats when dividing? To me this sounds like it was used to resolve a bug where divided numbers would be rounded improperly. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't allow floats for the other operators as well. The only problem this causes is printing the pointless <code>.0</code> at the end of a whole number. But you could solve that with a small function that tests <code>if int(num) == num</code> and then formatting the number accordingly, like this:</p>

<pre><code>def format_num(num):
    """Return num as a string without unnecessary float info"""

    if int(num) == num:
        return str(int(num))
    else:
        return str(num)


print(format_num(result))
</code></pre>

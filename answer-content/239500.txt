<p>Because this makes it much clearer and easier to read in my opinion.</p>

<p>Absolutely. And that's a good reason to do it. Your 80-100 character limit makes sense as well. 80 is considered a standard 'limit' of sorts in many languages (Python is famous for it, but back in the day punch cards and teletypes were already limited to 80 columns).</p>
<p>Google's <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#HTML_Line-Wrapping" rel="nofollow noreferrer">HTML style guide</a> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Break long lines (optional).</p>
<p>While there is no column limit recommendation for HTML, you may consider wrapping long lines if it significantly improves readability.</p>
<p>When line-wrapping, each continuation line should be indented at least 4 additional spaces from the original line.</p>

<p>You've already verified your <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">validator</a> doesn't have a problem with it either, so, go for it. In hindsight, if the validator would've had problems with it, it would've been time for a better validator.</p>
<p>Better readability =&gt; better maintainability =&gt; less bugs and less development time.</p>

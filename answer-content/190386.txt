<p>To save power you can use/implement a function to detect when the user is stationary. You can for example define a user in stationary state when the location has not changed in more than 2 minutes (set this parameter so it does not fire too often, as when the user stops at a red light). When stationary states are detected,  stop listen for location updates from the GPS and start listen for SIGNIFICANT_MOTION_SENSOR to detect active states. Be aware that not all models have this software sensor so you have to support situations when this is the case. </p>

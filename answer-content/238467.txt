<p>Specific suggestions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Parameter defaults are not relevant for <code>reveal_cards</code> - it's always called with <code>hide</code> set.</li>
<li>Boolean parameters are a code smell. Usually they should be replaced by two methods which each encapsulate just their difference, usually calling a third method to do the common work.</li>
<li>The ranks and suits and their values should probably be an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">enumeration</a>. That way any reference to for example the ace would be a reference to an enumeration value rather than a magic string which <em>happens</em> to be connected to a number elsewhere.</li>
<li>The value of the ace is <em>either</em> 1 <em>or</em> 11, depending on what's best for the player. That could be encapsulated by a method on the ace enum value.</li>
<li>Try to get rid of comments by improving the code where possible. For example, renaming <code>hand1</code> to <code>player_hand</code> removes the need for mapping that in a comment.</li>
<li>Mixing output and logic is usually a bad idea. Pulling out the printing code to just print the current state after each event should make the logic easier to read.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tool support suggestions</h2>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ambv/black" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>black</code></a> can automatically format your code to be more idiomatic. It'll do things like adjusting the vertical and horizontal spacing, while keeping the functionality of the code unchanged.</li>
<li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/isort/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>isort</code></a> can group imports (built-ins first, then libraries and finally imports from within your project) and sort them.</li>
<li><p><a href="https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>flake8</code></a> can give you more hints to write idiomatic Python:</p>

<pre><code>[flake8]
max-complexity = 4
ignore = W503,E203
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>I would then recommend validating your <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">type hints</a> using a strict <a href="https://github.com/python/mypy" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>mypy</code></a> configuration:</p>

<pre><code>[mypy]
check_untyped_defs = true
disallow_any_generics = true
disallow_untyped_defs = true
ignore_missing_imports = true
no_implicit_optional = true
warn_redundant_casts = true
warn_return_any = true
warn_unused_ignores = true
</code></pre>

<p>This ensures that anyone reading the code (including yourself) understand how it's meant to be called, which is very powerful in terms of modifying and reusing it.</p></li>

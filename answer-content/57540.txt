<p>I would recommend dumping the idea of free form text.  While I don't understand your use-case completely, I suggest giving the user a list to choose from.  Allow the user to pick or sort values from your list.  On the back end, you would only allow values from the sanctioned list and this will ease the coding quite a bit.</p>

<h3>Indentation</h3>

<p>You should indent your methods and if/while blocks in order to improve general readability.</p>

<h3>Unnecessary Recursion</h3>

<p>If your user decides to perform enough operations, it could result in the call stack overflowing and affecting other applications.  In your application, a loop is a more appropriate choice than recursion.</p>

<h3>DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself</h3>

<p>You have four different places where you are getting inputs.  While it may be OK on this occasion (it's only one line after all), if it were any longer I would suggest extracting it to a method to allow for easy reuse.</p>

<h3>Typo</h3>

<p><code>typer in lowercase</code> should be <code>type in lowercase</code>.</p>

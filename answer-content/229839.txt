<p>Your code looks okay to me. For your questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Flask uses Jinja template engine, it already does XSS filter automatically for you. So you don't need to worry about that. Actually, implementing a XSS filter has a lot of things to concern, so just leave it to the template engine.</li>
<li>For a toy app, storing data into a json file is fine. But in actual production environment, you should use a real database like mysql to handle this. Because once you've got a huge amount of data, reading all of them from a file would be very slow.</li>
</ol>

<p>I would like only to show other possibility how "lock" a variable, but Adriano Repetti shows a really nice work in the other post. So, you also might consider using <code>readonly</code> keyword which allows setting to the variable only in the constructor. So this will basically become (plus consider all the other stuff said by Adriano)</p>

<pre><code>public class User
{
    public readonly string FirstName;
    public readonly string Surname;
    public readonly string Email;

    public User(string firstName, string surname, string email)
    {
        FirstName = firstName;
        Surname = surname;
        Email = email;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: For clarification, I was addressing only the part about immutability. Without any further considerations about interfaces, reflections etc. as that was not asked for. And given "simplicity" of question it seemed a bit like overthinking.</p>

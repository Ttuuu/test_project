<h3>How do I improve the print_cpu_data function in the way it shows the information ?</h3>

<p>Well, nowadays the most common architectural pattern (design scheme) for many projects is the MVC its principle is to separate the classes and code constructs in your project into 3 packages (model-view-controller)</p>

<ul>
<li>In the model goes <em>all the code which constitutes your application logic</em> for example your class <code>GameCpu</code></li>
<li>In the view goes <em>the code which displays the information that the user is supposed to see</em> in exmaple a class which uses <code>tkinter, Pygame</code> etc.</li>
<li>In the controller goes the code which allows communication between model and view.</li>
</ul>

<p>You need to be aware that Desktop apps and Web apps have a different approach for the MVC due its nature.</p>

<h3>If I wish to make a GUI for the game (e.g tkinter, Pygame, etc), what part of the code should be made into functions and how to do so efficiently ?</h3>

<p>As I said, you could use an MVC pattern which is basically 3 packages named model, view, controller and import classes accordingly.</p>

<p>I believe your question is more likely to be answered with <strong>modularization</strong> and <strong>refactoring</strong></p>

<p>Modularization is to split independent code blocs into functions, and refactoring is to simplify the code you have written.</p>

<p>Well, I hope it helped you, maybe you need a couple of youtube videos to understand how MVC works. I know, it seems more work, but when you are debugging medium to semi-large <em>personal projects</em> it is worthy, in great scale projects its indispensable. (not just MVC, to use an architectural pattern with an enterprise architecture [the names makes it sound complex but actually it isn't]).</p>

<p>Note: You may ask why did i not answered your first question, well, the code does not work when I execute it, so I can't make suggestions in the air, plus if I recommend a new form to solve this problem, many mods request answers to be bassed on the poster's code.</p>

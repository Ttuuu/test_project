<p>First off, what @Blindman67 said.</p>

<p>However, if you were to use this approach in production code, there are a few things to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>You probably want to create a class/function with a functions like <code>add</code></li>
<li><p>I see a few issues with your add code:</p>

<pre><code>if (test_original[test[x]] === undefined){
  test_original[test[x]] = [];
  test_original[test[x]][0] = test[x];
}
else{
  test_original[test[x]].push(test[x]);
}
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Accessing <code>test[x]</code> is slower than assigning it to a temp variable, and use that temp variable</li>
<li>Even accessing several times <code>test_original[test[x]</code> is slow, you should reduce that to a maximum as well</li>
<li><p>You can assign an array with 1 element like this:</p>

<pre><code>test_original[test[x]] = [test[x]];
</code></pre></li>
</ul></li>
<li>JavaScript is all about lowerCamelCase, so <code>test_original</code> should be <code>testOriginal</code>, and really I think &lt;adjective&gt;&lt;noun&gt; is better than &lt;noun&gt;&lt;adjective&gt;, so <code>originalTest</code> would be even better</li>
<li>The Spartan naming convention has a place in JavaScript, but I would have gone with <code>i</code>(nteger) over <code>x</code></li>
<li>Your looping over arrays is not idiomatic, I would go for <code>for(;;)</code> loops or use the <code>forEach</code> method</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, just a thought, but in your output you have </p>

<ol start="20">
<li>73: 73,73,73</li>
<li>75: 75</li>
<li>79: 79</li>
<li>80: 80</li>
</ol>

<p>You could just store the counts in the array, instead of arrays</p>

<p><code>test_original[73]</code> would then contain <code>3</code> instead of <code>[73,73,73]</code> which saves space and is faster</p>

<p>Consider not using System.Drawing to manipulate images in ASP.NET:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Classes within the System.Drawing namespace are not supported for use
within a Windows or ASP.NET service. Attempting to use these classes
from within one of these application types may produce unexpected
problems, such as diminished service performance and run-time
exceptions.<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.drawing#remarks" rel="nofollow noreferrer">1</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>An alternative could be the new <a href="https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ImageSharp</a> library currently in pre-release or <a href="https://github.com/saucecontrol/PhotoSauce" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ImageScaler</a>.</p>

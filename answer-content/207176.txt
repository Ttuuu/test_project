<p><strong>Readability &amp; GoTo</strong></p>

<p>If you want to do the same action for 3 different if-statements make them one if-statement or make them a function. <code>goto</code> causes massive headaches when it's been months since you've touched the code and you come back to it not remembering a thing.</p>

<pre><code>rng.GetBytes(buffer);
var nextChar = (char)buffer[0];

var isNumber = nextChar &gt;= '0' &amp;&amp; nextChar &lt;= '9';
var isUppercaseLetter = nextChar &gt;= 'A' &amp;&amp; nextChar &lt;= 'Z';
var isLowercaseLetter = nextChar &gt;= 'a' &amp;&amp; nextChar &lt;= 'z';

if (isNumber || isUppercaseLetter || isLowercaseLetter)
{
    chars.Add(nextChar);
    ++counter;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now with the conditions named even an idiot like me can come in here and see that you're checking if the character is alpha-numeric. If you wanted to make it even more obvious you could go one step further and make it a function.</p>

<pre><code>public bool IsAlphaNumericCharacter(char c)
{
    var isNumber = c &gt;= '0' &amp;&amp; c &lt;= '9';
    var isUppercaseLetter = c &gt;= 'A' &amp;&amp; c &lt;= 'Z';
    var isLowercaseLetter = c &gt;= 'a' &amp;&amp; c &lt;= 'z';

    return isNumber
        || isUppercaseLetter
        || isLowercaseLetter;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then your loop becomes shorter and clearer.</p>

<pre><code>while (counter &lt; length)
{
    rng.GetBytes(buffer);
    var nextChar = (char)buffer[0];

    if (IsAlphaNumericCharacter(nextChar))
    {
        chars.Add(nextChar);
        ++counter;
    }   
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Bytes</strong></p>

<p>Is there a particular reason you're using <code>byte</code> for length instead of <code>int</code>? Also, was there a reason for <code>var buffer = new byte[1];</code> being an array instead of just <code>var buffer = new byte();</code></p>

<p>If the answer to both of those questions is no, then you could have a character array of size <code>length</code> instead of a <code>LinkedList&lt;char&gt;</code>.</p>

<p><strong>StringBuilder</strong></p>

<p><code>StringBuilder</code> could be beneficial, but if you're at a low amount of characters (like your link suggests) then it's probably not going to make a difference performance-wise (always best to test yourself instead of listening to a stranger on the internet though :P).</p>

<h3>ListChangedType.Reset</h3>

<p><code>AddItems</code> is nothing more than a glorified wrapper method for calling <code>Add</code> multiple times. However, guidelines suggest that <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.componentmodel.listchangedtype?view=netframework-4.8" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ListChangedType.Reset</a> could and probably should also be called here. Since <code>Reset</code> should be called when..</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Much of the list has changed. Any listening controls should refresh
  all their data from the list.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To give this method some purpose other than looping elements and call <code>Add</code>, consider using the same deferral strategy as you did with <code>SetItems</code>.</p>

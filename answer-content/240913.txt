<p>Not a review, but an extended comment.</p>

<p>This is a very common problem. Polling the bunch of event sources is easy to implement, but it leads to the flaws you've discoverd. The only way out is to abandon polling, and switch to <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/external-interrupts/attachinterrupt/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">interrupts</a>. In your case, consider to</p>

<pre><code>    attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(pin), ISR, RISING);
</code></pre>

<p>for each pin you are interested in, during <code>setup</code>. The ISR shall push a pin which triggered it into a queue. Then the <code>loop</code> would pick the pin numbers from the queue, and do whatever is relevant.</p>

<p>Be careful with synchronizing the queue between the ISR and the main line. Solving the synchronization is hard, but very enlightening.</p>

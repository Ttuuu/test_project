<p>Computing powers repeatedly and log are not cheap operations.
You could substitute them with cheaper alternatives:</p>

<ul>
<li>Instead of computing powers of <code>tens</code>, you could start with <code>1</code> and multiply in the loop steps.</li>
<li>Instead of computing the number of digits and using a counting loop, you could divide by 10 until reaching 0.</li>
</ul>

<p>Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>if (number == 0) {
  return 1;
}

int work = number;

int tens = 1;
int result = 0;
while (work &gt; 0) {
  int digit = work % 10;
  work /= 10;

  result += tens * (digit + 1);
  tens *= 10;
  if (digit == 9) {
    tens *= 10;
  }
}
return result;
</code></pre>
    </div>

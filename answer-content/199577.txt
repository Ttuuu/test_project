<p>Your add method can be simplified if you use a <code>collections.defaultdict</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class Lexicon:
    'a lexicon holding each term and providing some lexicon services like term frequency, and term ids'

    def __init__(self):
        self.dictt = defaultdict(int)

    â€¦

    def add(self, token):
        self.dictt[token] += 1
</code></pre>

<p>This would however loose the "traceability" (whatever that means).
However you can easily provide a method to check whether a token is contained within the dict:</p>

<pre><code>def __contains__(self, token):
    return token in self.dictt
</code></pre>

<p>This is imho a cleaner approach, since it separates your concerns.</p>

<p>You currently use pickle, to store the lexicon as a file. Consider using <code>json.{loads,dumps}</code> instead, which can easily be reused within a possible web application context.</p>

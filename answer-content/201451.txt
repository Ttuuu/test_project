<h3>Bug: uninitialized variables</h3>
<p>You didn't initialize <code>sharp</code> and <code>flat</code> to <code>false</code>, so they could randomly be <code>true</code> even when the note string doesn't contain any sharp or flat symbols.  You should make a habit of initializing all your local variables to avoid these kinds of problems.  Also, some compilers will warn you about uninitialized variables if you turn on full warnings, so you should look into how to do that for the compiler you are using.</p>

<p>Not much to say for such a simple algorithm.  However there is an optimization that you could employ.  Check for odd instead of even, then convert to even.  Then divide by 2.  At most this cuts your iterations by half.</p>

<p>It would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>public int NumberOfSteps(int num)
{
    int count = 0;
    while (num != 0)
    {
        if(num % 2 == 1)
        {
            num -= 1;
            ++count;
        }
        if(num &gt; 0)
        {
            num /= 2;
            ++count;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
</code></pre>
    </div>

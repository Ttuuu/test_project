<p>It’s not really clear what you are trying to achieve. Judging from the code smells I see, this code needs a helper method/object. Don’t be afraid of adding private functions, besides the ones defined in the public interface.</p>

<p>During a traversal, a collection of already visited objects needs to be maintained. The entry method should create it locally and pass it to another private method visit(componentId, visited). This way the visited collection will get automatically garbage collected, when you are finished.</p>

<p>From the performance point of view, it seems that you need a <code>LinkedHashMap</code>, not an <code>ArrayList</code>.</p>

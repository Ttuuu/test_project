<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>The only major thing I would change is that: </p>

<pre><code>if len(item['vendors']) != 0
</code></pre>

<p>Is the same as:</p>

<pre><code>if item['vendors']
</code></pre>

<p>Because an empty list will return back as False. If you want to try it out: </p>

<pre><code>a = []
bool(a)      # False
b = [1,2,3]
bool(b)      # True
</code></pre>

<p>I would also be careful with what you have because those dictionaries that you are converting might have more than one value, in which case you would miss them. This is the line that I am referring to:</p>

<pre><code>    paths = [item['paths'][0]['path_label'] for item in data]
</code></pre>
    </div>

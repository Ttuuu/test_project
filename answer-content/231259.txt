<p>I will focus on one thing already addressed by another answer but that I think deserve more attention: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Single Responsibility Principle.</a></p>

<p>Your <code>NBody</code> class has several functionalities merged into one, which would be advisable to separate. It, as far as I can see:</p>

<ul>
<li>it represent a group of N particles</li>
<li>it provides the algorithm to perform the physics simulation</li>
<li>it provides the facilities to print the results of the simulation</li>
</ul>

<p>I think there is enough material to separate these into three separate entities, leaving more flexibility for changing in the future.</p>

<p>Also, some of the methods in your <code>NBody</code> class actually act only on the given <code>Particle</code>, so they could be refactored as methods of the <code>Particle</code> struct.</p>

<p>Another suggestion is to take a look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_method_pattern" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Template Method Pattern</a>, which could be a useful starting point for the simulation framework to provide the right flexibility to change the integration method if it ever becomes necessary.</p>

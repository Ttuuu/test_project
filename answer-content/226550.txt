<p>The static variables declared in the beginning of the class should be constants and named according to naming conventions.</p>

<pre><code>private static final int LOWER_RANGE = 1;
private static final int UPPER_RANGE = 99;
private static final int MAX_TRIES = 6;
</code></pre>

<p>Things that are not meant to change should be final. It's debatable if these should be named like constants like above, as they are static and final, but in this context of pure procedural programming, the static keyord doesn't make much difference, so going lower case can be justified.</p>

<pre><code>private static final Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
private static final Random random = new Random();
</code></pre>

<p>A number guessing game should handle invalid input too, so the code should catch NumberFormatException. However, now that the input reading became more complex, I would refactor it into a separate method. How errors and user's desire to stop playing is reported is again debatable, but since the context is procedural programming, I'm sticking to C-style magic return values.</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * Read input from user.
 *
 * @return The user's guess or -1 if the user wants to stop playing.
 */    
private static int readGuess() { 
  ...
}
</code></pre>

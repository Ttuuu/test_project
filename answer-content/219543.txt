<h1>FP arithmetic</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Besides trivialities i.e. inserting constants</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is <em>kind</em> of a constant, but perhaps you'll view it as non-trivial.
For one thing it allows turning a division into a (cheaper) multiplication.</p>
<p>Rather than supplying two args to <code>math.log()</code>, use this faster technique:</p>
<pre><code>    # one-time init
    rad_five = sqrt(5)
    phi = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2
    recip_phi = 1 / phi

    # compute log base b, that is, base phi
    log((LAMBs + 1 + 0.5) * rad_five) * recip_phi
</code></pre>
<p>Invoking with 1 arg and then multiplying definitely runs faster.</p>
<h1>lookup table</h1>
<p>We accept a number that is at most a billion,
then compute lots of detailed mantissa bits,
only to have <code>ceil()</code> discard most of them.
Which is to say that the only input values you <em>really</em> care about
are the ones that bump the log result past the next integer lattice point.
Store such values in an ordered lookup table.
Repeated multiplication by <code>phi</code> will help you find them.</p>
<p>At runtime, compute the relevant log result using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html" rel="noreferrer">binary search</a>
on the lookup table.</p>
<p>And yeah, you're right, you want to promote the <code>import</code>s to top-of-file.</p>

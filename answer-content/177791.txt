<p>If the error handling takes too much space in your code, you can invent a little helper function.</p>

<pre><code>private static void ensure(boolean condition, String message) {
    if (!condition) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException(message);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Using this helper method, you can write the <code>power</code> function like this:</p>

<pre><code>long power(int n, int p) {
    ensure(n != 0 || p != 0, "n and p should not be zero.");
    ensure(n &gt;= 0, "n should not be negative.");
    ensure(p &gt;= 0, "p should not be negative.");
    return (long)Math.pow(n, p);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the messages are all string literals. If you were to use a string expression like <code>"n is negative: " + n</code> instead, this string would be computed on every invocation of <code>power</code>, which would make your code very slow. Using string literals, on the other hand, doesn't cost any time.</p>

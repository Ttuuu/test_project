<p>A Priority Queue is synonymous with a heap so I'm assuming that the implication in this assignment was to implement a maximally efficient data structure. </p>

<p>The optimal implementation is spelled out in Wikipedia: <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)" rel="nofollow">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)</a></p>

<p>If it were me, I would use a tree instead of a list. There is no Node class. A Heap object has two nullable Heap children, and every operation is recursive in nature. Length, for example, would just return each child's length or 1 if no children existed. The other operations would take advantage of the tree's structure in order to return results in logarithmic time. </p>

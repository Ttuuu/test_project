<p>While sharing styles is possible, I find it a little cumbersome and personally, I would <strong>not</strong> do it. Instead, I'd recommend going one level higher: do not share <em>styles</em>, share <em>components</em>.</p>

<p>That's what React is about - sharing components. In React Native, you won't have to import a component and styles (and pass the styles to the component), you'll just have to import the component. There will be less duplication.</p>

<p>I'd recommend you take a look at <a href="https://www.styled-components.com/docs" rel="nofollow noreferrer">styled-components</a> or glamorous-native, and see their utilities for defining styles, extending them and other utilities. They will make working with styles and components easier.</p>

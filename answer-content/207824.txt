<p>Proper use of a <code>Pool p</code> should include <code>p.close()</code> and <code>p.join()</code> (in this order).</p>

<p>Cases of the websites not responding should be handled. Requests should have a timeout, the timeout exception is caught, and non-200 should be handled as well.</p>

<p>Other than that, the script is correct for a one time extract of a few pages, but will need to be extended if you intend to produce a high volume daemon. If that is the case, usage of <code>Pool</code> can be questionnable and has multiple alternatives, such as using Scrapy framework scheduler or using a celery broker for high-level handling of workers (this will avoid your workers to crash entirely on exceptions, among a few other benefits).</p>

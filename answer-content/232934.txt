<p>If you build a dictionary of keyword arguments (customarily called <code>kwargs</code>), you can address the two options separately and consolidate everything into one call to <code>MongoClient</code>. This has the advantage that if you update e.g. the SSL part, you only need to change it in one place instead of remembering to change it twice:</p>

<pre><code>host = '{host}:{port}'.format(**config[component])
kwargs = {"serverSelectionTimeoutMS": timeout}

if config.getboolean(component, 'ssl', fallback=False):
    kwargs["ssl"] = True
    kwargs["ssl_ca_certs"] = config.get(component, 'ssl_path')

if auth_required:
    kwargs.update({"username": username, "password": password,
                   "authSource": auth_source, "authMechanism": auth_mechanism})

client = MongoClient(host, **kwargs)
</code></pre>

<p>I also used the fact that <code>config[component]</code> seems to be a dictionary, so you can unpack it in the <code>format</code> and the <code>host</code> and <code>port</code> keys will be used.</p>

<p>I used two different ways to change the values in the dictionary so you can choose, depending on which one is easier to read. Using both is also fine, as I did here. For the SSL part there is few values, so using <code>dict.update</code> would make it more cluttered, but for the auth part there are enough values that typing <code>kwargs[...] = ...</code> would get tedious.</p>

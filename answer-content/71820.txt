  <p>I'm representing DB tables as classes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, you're not. You are representing objects as classes - the same objects that you store as rows in your database tables. In other words, you are using classes as data structures. Consider this:</p>

<pre><code>class Player extends DB {
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is wrong: a player is not a database (and a database is not a table). So I suggest to rename your <code>DB</code> class to, for example, <code>Row</code> or <code>PODS</code> (Plain Old Data Structure)</p>

<p>You would be representing DB tables as classes if you had a class like this (pseudocode):</p>

<pre><code>class Table {
    private Column[] columns;
    private Index[] indexes;
    ...
    public addColumn(column);
    public drop();
    ...
}
</code></pre>
    </div>

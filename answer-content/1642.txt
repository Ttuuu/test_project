<p>It runs in <span class="math-container">\$O(n)\$</span> time so I'm not sure there's a way to improve this.  It looks like you've implemented the algorithm pretty well, according the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Fisher-Yates shuffle</a>.</p>

<p>You might consider not using <code>Object</code> if you can use the type that's stored in the array instead.</p>

<p>I also thought I read somewhere that it should be safe to loop to <span class="math-container">\$n/2\$</span> instead of <span class="math-container">\$n\$</span> (because you're swapping with elements from <span class="math-container">\$1 \cdots n\$</span> so in theory, you shouldn't need to swap every element), but I don't have hard proof of that, so you take your chances ;)</p>

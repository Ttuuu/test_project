  <p>Is there a better way of doing Task cancellation than the one I implemented</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's no task cancellation implemented here. By passing a token to <code>Task.Run</code> you just make the returned task <code>IsCanceled</code> equal to true in case it cancels itself (without, it gets <code>IsFaulted</code> by the <code>OperationCanceledException</code>). But you need (at least) to pass the token to <code>DoSomeWork</code>, because that has to check the token and cancel itself.</p>

<p>Task cancellation works through cooperation of the to-be-canceled task and has nothing to do with <code>Thread.Abort</code>.</p>

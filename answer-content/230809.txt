<p>A common problem for "western" programmers is the inability to process letters that consist of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5903008/what-is-a-surrogate-pair-in-java">multiple characters</a>. Your approach will fail if it encounters one of those.</p>

return reverse.toString().equals(original);
</code></pre>

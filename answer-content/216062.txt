<p>I have reviewed your code and here are my analysis-</p>

<p>use modulo operator(%) to get the remainder in place of using too much mathematics like</p>

<pre><code>long remainder = num - (quotient * 10); //note: it will just shorten your code 
// but will be overhead as well because internally it will 
//perform three operation(multiplication, subtraction, division).
// C = A % B is equivalent to C = A â€“ B * (A / B).
</code></pre>

<p>could be simplified to   </p>

<pre><code>long remainder = num % 10;
</code></pre>

<p>You don't need an extra method to count divisor it can be done in the same method itself.</p>

<p>You can merge both method while extracting the digit itself can check whether it's a divisor or not?</p>

<pre><code>static int findDigits(int n) {
    int count = 0;
    int num = n;
    while (n &gt; 0) {
        int r = n % 10;  // to get the remainder
        if (r != 0 &amp;&amp; num % r == 0)  // checking for the divisor
            count++;
        n = n / 10;   // using to remove last digit
    }
    return count;
}
</code></pre>

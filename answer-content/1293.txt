<p>Naming (minor): Something possibly more specific to the domain for sector boundaries ('left'? and 'right'? relative angles) might be instead be called a radial.  Each radial in at least [aeronautical] navigation is referred to as the '#named number of radial# radial', such as 'the 025 radial', or commonly just by number, 'the 025' (read as zero two five).  Perhaps this would help minimize magic numbers by declaring your boundaries as named radial constants.  </p>

<p>To go a step further, since you are dividing the compass into equally sized parts, or partitions, you might create constant/immutable value objects that describe these partitions.  'CardinalDirection' (n e s w) with public getters of left radial and right radial is an revised offhand suggestion.  Ordinals are the next set of directional divisions (ne se sw nw).</p>

<p>Hope this helps refine your model for the better. </p>

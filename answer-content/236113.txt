<p>Do you necessarily want to have one Event-Manager only ?</p>

<p>If you would have <code>EventManager&lt;t&gt;</code>, instead of 3 generic methods, you would have one Eventmanager by Type. It's already resolved at compile time, which dictionary to access.</p>

<p>Today, <code>Trigger&lt;int&gt;</code> and <code>Trigger&lt;string&gt;</code> put their things in the same dictionary, which you need to subdivide by type.</p>

<p>If you have <code>EventManager&lt;T&gt;</code>, a call to Trigger would just insert in the dictionary, other Types would have other dictionaries.</p>

<p>Something else:</p>

<p>If you have influence on how your incidentID is used, you could use a little registry for this, and generate continuous numbers, you just have to define, where this number is used the first time. Doing so, you can safe the top-dictionary also, it would be just a full-length indexed array - very easy to access, very performant.
As a side effect you can also attach a string, to the incidentID, this makes debugging messages and exceptions more readable.</p>

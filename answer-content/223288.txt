<p>My first instinct is that your code is a pretty “cool” way to rewrite if else statements, but I don’t think it gains you too much. If you have massive amounts of if trees and want to make them more readable, I would consider using polymorphism to your advantage or, when appropriate, strategy pattern. </p>

<p>If you want some help refactoring a certain if tree please feel free to post the code and we can help. </p>

<p>There are often, IMO, two big reasons to make a new abstraction. </p>

<p>1) to decrease the mental load on the maintainers of this code or </p>

<p>2) to increase the ability to add new features in the future. </p>

<p>Both of these are, of course, related. My question is, and feel free to comment below, does your if abstraction decrease maintainer mental load through simplicity or brevity and/or does your if abstraction improve the ability to add new features in the future? If not then you need to consider why you are doing it in the first place.</p>

<p>A few issues with the code:</p>

<ul>
<li>You're comparing the <em>string</em> length for both, but then replacing the <em>bytes</em>. In UTF-8 encoding, as you're using, it's possible that the two will be different: if find = "aeiou" and replace = "áéíóú" you'll have findBytes.Length == 5, and replaceBytes.Length == 10</li>
<li>You don't need to pass the position parameter by reference to <code>SearchBytePattern</code>, since you're not changing the reference, only calling methods on it.</li>
<li>On <code>SearchBytePattern</code>, you don't need the outermost loop to go all the way to <code>bytes.Length</code>, it only needs to go to <code>bytes.Length - pattern.Length + 1</code> (and that would simplify the inner "if"</li>
<li>stream.Read doesn't necessarily return the count of bytes you asked for - it can return less than that. Your code should be ready to handle that situation.</li>
</ul>

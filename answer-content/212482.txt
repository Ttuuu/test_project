<p>Not looked in detail at the interesting stuff, but a couple of tiny things jumped out at me:</p>

<h1><code>CalcBufferSize</code></h1>

<p>This method looks wrong:</p>

<pre><code>public static int CalcBufferSize( int n, int max )
// Calculates a power of 2 &gt;= n, but not more than max.
{
  if ( n &gt;= max ) return max;
  int result = 1;
  while ( result &lt; n ) result = result &lt;&lt; 1;
  return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The comment (or inline documentation) should probably explain here that you assume <code>max</code> is a power of two (because it doesn't work otherwise); this might cause confusion in the future otherwise. I see that you've made this method private in later revisions, so that's good.</p>

<h1>Heap Sort</h1>

<p>I think your heap-sort in <code>PackageMerge</code> can be better. Repeated insertion is <code>O(n log(n))</code>, but you can build a heap from a known set of elements in linear time (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap#Building_a_heap" rel="nofollow noreferrer">lazy Wikipedia reference</a>), which is an option there (and I'm assuming you've benchmarked your own heap-sort against <code>Array.Sort</code> and such if this matters). I'd also feel compelled to add parentheses into <code>(ulong)Used[ i ] &lt;&lt; IdBits | i )</code>, since both <code>&lt;&lt;</code> and <code>|</code> are uncommon operations and the order of operations may not be clear.</p>

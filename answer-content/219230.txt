<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/878704">This answer to a question on multi line strings</a> contains a lot of good examples of trouble with building multi line string output this way but in particular I think the String.format approach works best with a template string.</p>

<p>Your setup would be something like</p>

<pre><code>String template = “ Name: %s %n ID: ...”
</code></pre>

<p>And you would place it with</p>

<pre><code>String formatted = String.format(template, nameString, idString,...);
</code></pre>

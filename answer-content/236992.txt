<p>Your implementation looks good. It's an in memory algorithm so space wise you can't do better. Timewise you're looping over each element swapping it twice so that's perfectly fine.</p>

<p>The only remark left to give is the typo in rever<strong>es</strong>Array -&gt; rever<strong>se</strong>Array.</p>

<p>It's also possible to print the array using <code>System.out.println(Arrays.toString(arr));</code> so you don't really need your own method.</p>

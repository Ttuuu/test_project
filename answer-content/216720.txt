<p>I would suggest declaring your semaphores as fair:  </p>

<pre><code>static Semaphore readLock = new Semaphore(1, true);
static Semaphore writeLock = new Semaphore(1, true);
</code></pre>

<p>With that, the threads are placed into a FIFO queue when blocked, so any starvation problems are solved.</p>

<p>BTW, I've added a new version <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/216603/java-many-readers-one-writer-with-semaphores-and-multithreading">in this post</a></p>

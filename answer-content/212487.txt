<p>Yes as others suggested the best and cheapest way. Although if you wouldn't like to use collections then you could do something like this too.</p>

<pre><code>def are_anagrams(str1, str2):
    if len(str1) == len(str2):
        return sorted(str1) == sorted(str1)
</code></pre>

<p>For large anagrams this isn't optimal but its still one liner and pure python no collections.
Anyway using a dictionary is far cheaper then using sorting on strings (at least I think so).</p>

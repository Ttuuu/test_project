<p>To replace the elements in-place without building a new list,
you would need to reassign the elements at each index, that is,
essentially <code>zorglubs[i] = zorglubs[i].transform()</code> for each index <code>i</code> in the list.</p>

<p>A perhaps elegant way to do this is using the <code>eachWithIndex</code> function,
which gives you access to each element and its index:</p>

<pre><code>zorglubs.eachWithIndex { it, index -&gt; zorglubs[index] = it.transform() }
</code></pre>
    </div>

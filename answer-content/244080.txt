<p>Correct me if I'm wrong but aren't functions and overloading operators basically the same thing, a glorified goto statement? I would only put it in if it makes it easier to read when you come back to it in 3 months.</p>
<p>I would change all the <code>1u &lt;&lt; x</code> to the hex value.
Those carry marks will not change any time soon, so you could make them constants and not rely on that function.</p>
<p>I think you forgot a <code>continue</code> in your for loop for <code>ALPHA &amp;&amp; OMEGA</code></p>
<p>Are you ever worried about a string longer than an unsigned characters? <code>unsigned k = 0; k &lt; len; ++k</code> Are you restricting the size of the string else where?</p>
<p>Other than that, it looks okay.</p>

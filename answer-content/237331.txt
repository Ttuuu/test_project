<p>You have one bug in your code. The <code>binaryGap</code> function is supposed to be side-effect free. Your implementation isn't since it modifies the global variable <code>i</code>.</p>

<p>To fix this, apply the following patch:</p>

<pre><code>-   for (i=0; i&lt;bin.length; i++){
+   for (let i=0; i&lt;bin.length; i++){
</code></pre>

<p>There are 2 lines in your code that are redundant:</p>

<pre><code>if (gaps.length===1){
  return gaps[0];
else
</code></pre>

<p>When you remove the above code, you have reduced your code by 2 lines, and it still works the same as before.</p>

<p>The rest of the code looks fine. There's a more efficient way to calculate the binary gap though, as I outlined <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/217515/6499">in my answer to the same question in Java</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>getClient</code>, I'm pretty sure you should pass through the <code>context</code>
object from the outside and not simply create a dummy with
<code>Background</code>.  Also, at some point doing both logging of an error
<em>and</em> passing it back will bite you because you're going to end up
with two or more copies of the same error (unless you're 100% diligent
about only logging it at the origin).</li>
<li>Same <code>context</code> comment goes for all other methods actually.  As a user
of the library I want to pass in <em>my</em> context, otherwise there's
little point to it.</li>
<li>The configurations in <code>createSubscription</code> look like they should be
coming from the outside, that is, have defaults, but let the user
override them.  The comments are great though if they're not explained
as part of the <code>pubsub</code> library already.</li>
<li>In <code>Process</code>, the anonymous function doesn't have to have parameters,
it'll simply capture the values of <code>subscriber</code> and <code>output</code>
automatically.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'd say the wait group is fine?  Assuming that the <code>Stop</code> call will
cause the appropriate error that shuts down the goroutine running
<code>Process</code>.  What's a bit vague to me is if it's intentional that the
<code>errorHandler</code> is always called, even when the subscriber is terminated
via <code>Stop</code>?  It's not the worst of problems of course.</p>

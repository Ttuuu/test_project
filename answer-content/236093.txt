<li><p>gcdn[] is unused.  </p></li>
<li><p>if n==0, you access a non-existent array element, and even if it isn't, you do the GCD with a[0] twice.  </p></li>
<li><p>gcd() is called before it is declared, which is bad style and can mess up optimization.  </p></li>
<li><p>you might think about whether the M or arr[] elements are likely to be larger.  The order you pass values to gcd() can reduce by one loop if you guess right.</p></li>
<li><p>The tail recursion on gcd() should be OK as long as you optimize.</p></li>

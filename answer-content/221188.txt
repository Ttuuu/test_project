<p>This is a surprisingly difficult problem, especially you want it to work reliably in mobile browsers. That's why there are quite a few plugins out there. Full disclosure, I'm the author of one of them (<a href="https://lithiumlist.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">lithiumlist.com</a>). When developing Lithium List, here are some of the issues I had to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>From a UX perspective, how will the sorting item be visualised? I<br>
found that a sizable drop shadow and small scale increase works well. Something like <code>box-shadow: 0 5px 14px rgba(0,0,0,0.15), 0 6px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.12)</code> and <code>transform: scale(1.02)</code>.</li>
<li>Will the non-sorting items slide up/down during sorting? Using CSS<br>
translations to move the items, together with transitions, can help to make this smooth.</li>
<li>When sorting finishes, will the item move smoothly to its final position? 
Again, CSS translations and transitions can help with this.</li>
<li>What happens if the sorting item reaches the top/bottom of the viewport?<br>
Ideally the list or page will automatically scroll.</li>
<li>Safari on MacOS (not iOS) produces strange jerky behaviour when a selection is<br>
dragged beyond the top/bottom of the browser window. Setting<br>
<code>overflow: hidden</code> on <code>#checklist</code> (even if only during sorting) will fix this.</li>
</ul>

<p>By the way, you are right to apply the <code>user-select: none</code> classes to prevent selection during sorting. You probably also want <code>-ms-user-select: none</code> since you've included the 'ms' prefix elsewhere. You may also want to consider <code>-webkit-touch-callout</code>, which disables the callout in iOS browsers.</p>

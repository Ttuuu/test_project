<p>Please note that you should be posting working code in your question, not pseudo code. It is a general rule for Code Review questions.</p>

<p>There is also a problem with your pseudo code. Your <code>function_3</code> will never get executed. Note that the first two <code>if</code> blocks require either <code>$value_1</code> or <code>$value_2</code> to be filled, which is exactly what the third <code>if</code> block states. Since it is in the third position it will never get executed. You would have know this if it was actual code. That's one of the reasons you should post working code.</p>

<p>So it can be rewitten as:</p>

<pre><code>if (empty($value_1)) {
    if (empty($value_2)) {
        function_default(){ }
    }
    else {
        function_2(){ }
    } 
} elseif (empty($value_2)) {
    function_1(){ } 
}
</code></pre>

<p>But I doubt this is useful to you, since you clearly want to do something else.</p>

<p>Your code suggests you want to define functions depending on certain conditions. I cannot think of any good reason to do this. Can you give me one?</p>

<p>So, can your code be written better? Yes, it clearly can. Can it be made faster? Given the little code you've written, I have to say: No.</p>

<h1>Let me tell you about <code>IMPORTHTML()</code>...</h1>

<p>So here's all the code you need in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets" rel="noreferrer">Google Sheets</a>:</p>

<pre><code>=IMPORTHTML("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_count", "table", 2)
</code></pre>

<p>The import seems to work fine:

<p>And it's possible to download the table as CSV:</p>

<p>You'll just need to clean the numbers up, which you'd have to do anyway with the API or by scraping with BeautifulSoup.</p>

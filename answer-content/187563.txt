<p>Your program's time complexity is \$O(n*m)\$ and space complexity is \$O(n + m)\$ where 'n' is no. of lines in the first file and 'm' is no. of lines in second file.</p>

<p>Here is an optimised version of the above program, with time complexity \$O(n + m)\$ and space complexity \$O( min(m,n) )\$. I have not tested this program, but it should be able to present output on the screen within few seconds :)<br></p>

<pre><code>import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

class Main{
   public static void main(String args[]){
      try ( BufferedReader reader1 = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file1.txt"));
            BufferedReader reader2 = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file2.txt")) ){

            //assuming file1.txt is smaller than file2.txt in terms of no. of lines
            HashSet&lt;String&gt; file1 = new HashSet&lt;String&gt;();

            String s = null;
            while( ( s = reader1.readLine()) != null){
               file1.add(s);
            }

            while( (s = reader2.readLine()) != null ){
               if(file1.contains(s))
                  System.out.println(s);
            }
      }
      catch(IOException e){
         System.out.println(e);
      }

   }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Only one file is in memory at a time and HashSet&lt;&gt; instead of nested loops for comparison.</p>

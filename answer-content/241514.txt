<p>As pointed out in the comments by both MrVajid and AJNeufeld, the previous solution (now deleted because it is actually irrelevant now; see post history) actually did not work.
This is because in reality, the task requires the input array to <em>not</em> be a set, aka it should be allowed to have duplicate entries.</p>

<p>In fact, I had solved that challenge successfully a while ago, using:</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>n, m = [int(x) for x in input().split()]

array = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
A = {int(x) for x in input().split()}
B = {int(x) for x in input().split()}

happiness = 0

for value in array:
    change = 1 if value in A else -1 if value in B else 0
    happiness += change

print(happiness)
</code></pre>

<p>This is using <code>set</code> comprehension (<code>{ }</code>) and passes just fine on HackerRank.</p>

<p>Iteration over the input array as a <code>list</code> is still <span class="math-container">\$O(n)\$</span>, see <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>, but containment checks for sets is constant time, <span class="math-container">\$O(1)\$</span>. Previously, with <span class="math-container">\$A\$</span> and <span class="math-container">\$B\$</span> being lists, this was also linear as <span class="math-container">\$O(m)\$</span>, leading to <span class="math-container">\$O(n*m)\$</span> aka quadratic time complexity.</p>

<p>Since this task on HackerRank is specifically about <code>set</code> usage, it will judge pedantically about time complexity, with only the approach using sets not running into timeout errors.</p>

<hr>

<p>Notice that your solution also has an error apart from the <code>set</code> one.
You check for containment in <code>happy_set</code> and decrement <code>happy</code> for a negative result.
However, you first need to check for containment in <code>sad_set</code> first.
Otherwise, you are much sadder than required.</p>

<p>In Python there is no need to initialize variables before using them. So e.g. <code>avgproteinlength = 0</code> is not needed.</p>

<p>Python also has an official style-guide, <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP8</a>, which recommend using <code>lower_case_with_underscores</code> for variable and function names, so that should probably be named <code>average_protein_length</code>.</p>

<p>While we are renaming things, <code>species_name_function</code> is probably better named <code>get_species_name</code>.</p>

<p>Now, <a href="http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/api/Bio.Seq.Seq-class.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Bio.Seq</code></a> objects actually support getting their length, so your main block can be greatly reduced in complexity (which should also cut down on the runtime). You can also pull out getting the species name from the loop (it should stay the same, and if not you are not taking that into account at the moment either). You are also not using the <code>frequency</code> variable, nor the <code>listofbases</code>.</p>

<pre><code>from statistics import mean

if __name__ == '__main__':
    infile = sys.argv[1]
    species_name = get_species_name(infile)
    genomes = (fasta.seq for fasta in SeqIO.parse(open(infile), "fasta")) # a generator
    average_protein_length = mean(len(seq) for seq in genomes)

    with open("proteinlength.csv", "a") as myfile:
        myfile.write(f"{average_protein_length}\t{species_name}\t\n")
</code></pre>

<p>I used the Python 3.4+ <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.mean" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>statistics.mean</code></a> function and the Python 3.6+ <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">f-strings</a>.</p>

<p>This of course assumes that the length of the genome which you calculate by hand by summing all frequencies, is the same as the length of the genome sequence.</p>

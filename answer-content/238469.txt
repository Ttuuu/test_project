<p>Your code is not thread-safe. You should use <code>ConcurrentHashMap</code> instead of <code>HashMap</code>, if this code is ever run in a multithreaded environment.</p>

<p>In Java 8 there was a <a href="https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8161372" rel="noreferrer">terrible performance bug</a> in <code>ConcurrentHashMap.computeIfAbsent</code>, which would lock the whole map even if the key already exists. That bug has been fixed in Java 9. See also <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26481796/concurrenthashmap-computeifabsent/26483476">this question</a>.</p>

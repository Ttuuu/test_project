<h1>Help the end user!</h1>

<p>If I was using this script, and forgot to put one or both of the filepaths when calling the script, there would be this error: <code>IndexError: list index out of range</code>. This error wouldn't help the user in a significant way. Consider this:</p>

<pre><code>try:
    path1 = sys.argv[1]  
    path2 = sys.argv[2]
except IndexError:
    raise Exception("Usage: python3 jpg_to_png.py &lt;path to input folder&gt; &lt;path to output folder&gt;")
</code></pre>

<p>This gives the user a detailed message on how the use your script.</p>

<h1>Remove commented code.</h1>

<p>Code you don't need anymore adds useless clutter, and can make your code harder to read.</p>

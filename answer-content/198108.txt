<p>I'd suggest to do not use StringBuilder as a source of data - it could be replaced with List or even plain arrays because StringBuilder-s used to invoke charAt(idx) and then some if comparing obtained char as int.</p>

<p>For me usage of number of CORES (I assume it will not be hardcoded but obtained from system props) is a kind of bad practice. You think that if you start as many threads as number of cores than all these threads will run in parallel and all of them will <em>do</em> calculations at the same time and you will get the result as soon as possible. Such assumptions are not correct because does not take into account thread scheduling on OS and hardware level which indeed exists and sometimes has much bigger impact on overall performance than code constructions you wrote. I strongly suggest to consider <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/forkjoin.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Fork/Join methodology</a> in case you use Java modern enough.</p>

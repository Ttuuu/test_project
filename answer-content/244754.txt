<p>Whereas @pacmaninbw offers some excellent general strategies, let's look at some specific syntax.</p>
<h2>Pi</h2>
<p>This is a point of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5007925/using-m-pi-with-c89-standard">some contention</a>, but - where a library defines <code>M_PI</code>, and most do - I tend to use it. Since you're including <code>windows.h</code> it's likely that you're using MSVC. In that case, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/math-constants?view=vs-2019" rel="nofollow noreferrer">it gives you math constants</a> if you configure the compiler with <code>_USE_MATH_DEFINES</code>.</p>
<p>My opinion is that this is a precompiler directive, and the precompiler is build-configurable, so configure it in the build. If you need to port this to Linux, the precompiler configuration necessary to support <code>M_PI</code> would change, but you can cross that bridge when you get there.</p>
<h2>Prototype</h2>
<pre><code>load();                    //Function Prototype
</code></pre>
<p>It is? For what function? I don't see this defined anywhere.</p>
<h2>Variable declaration</h2>
<p>Since C99, predeclaring all variables at the top of the function is both unnecessary and, I find, unsightly. You can declare and initialize these where they are used. Also, your naming (Oof?) needs a little love.</p>
<h2>Implicit string concatenation</h2>
<p>Split this:</p>
<pre><code>    printf("\n\nWhich mode do you want to use?\n[1] Normal maths operations\n[2] Special Functions\n[3] Fibonacci Series\n[4] Random Mathematical Question\n[5] Exit\n\nYour input: ");
</code></pre>
<p>into</p>
<pre><code>printf(
    "\n\n"
    "Which mode do you want to use?\n"
    "[1] Normal maths operations\n"
    "[2] Special Functions\n"
    "[3] Fibonacci Series\n"
    "[4] Random Mathematical Question\n"
    "[5] Exit\n\n"
    "Your input: "
);
</code></pre>
<h2>Use a <code>switch</code></h2>
<p>This, and its related comparisons:</p>
<pre><code>if (Opt == '1'){
</code></pre>
<p>should use a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-language/switch-statement-c?view=vs-2019" rel="nofollow noreferrer">switch</a>.</p>
<h2>Order of operations</h2>
<pre><code>                                ans = ( log(Num2) / log(Num1));
</code></pre>
<p>does not need outer parens.</p>

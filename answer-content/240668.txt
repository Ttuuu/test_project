<p>Calling the functions setting the maximum number of threads to use change a global state inside the respective libraries which makes the decorator not thread safe. When you use the numpy functions from several different threads, the threads not using your decorator might also get a single threaded implementation called.</p>

<p>AFAIK there is no good way to solve this. <a href="https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/wiki/faq#multi-threaded" rel="nofollow noreferrer">OpenBLAS FAQ</a> even states that you should disable threads in OpenBLAS if your application uses threads itself.</p>

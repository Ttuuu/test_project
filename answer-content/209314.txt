<p>As you said, regex is not meant for HTML parsing. But as you are aware of it and it's a conscious choice, parsing a well-defined tree is, I guess, OK. 
The code is easy to read and follow. One improvement would be to break out the actual tag handling (the content of the ifs) from <code>iterate</code> to separate functions, like <code>handle_link</code>, <code>handle_folder</code>, etc. That way, it's even easier to scan the code for functionality without getting into the nitty gritty details.</p>

<p>Opening, reading, and stripping the file could all be done inside the <code>with</code> statement. Keep closely related stuff together, easier to follow.</p>

<p>The <code>change_folder</code> function is too complex. To get items from the end of a list, just use a negative index. The last item is thus [-1].</p>

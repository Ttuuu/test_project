<h1>clear() is buggy</h1>

<p>The following code causes a <code>NoSuchElementException</code>:</p>

<pre><code>DynamicQueue queue = new DynamicQueue();
queue.offer("First");
queue.clear();
queue.offer("First");
queue.poll();
</code></pre>

<p>You can ealy fix it by adding <code>tail = null;</code> to your <code>clear()</code> method.</p>

<h1>Use selfexplaing exception messages</h1>

<p>An exception name (in this case <code>NoSuchElementException</code>) already describes the kind of error accurred. The cause should explain <em>why</em> this happened. A better message for exaple could simply be <strong>"this queue is empty"</strong>.</p>

<h1>Suggestion: add a return type to poll()</h1>

<p>If <code>poll()</code> returns the current head, the user doesn't need to do call <code>peek()</code>. This wouldn't even change your <code>main(String[])</code>, since the user is not forced to use the returned object at all.</p>

<hr>

<p>Of course, you could also add a <strong>generic type</strong> to your class instead of using <code>Object</code> inside your <code>Node</code>, but I guess that was not your intension, since you are already familiar with the Java Collections.</p>

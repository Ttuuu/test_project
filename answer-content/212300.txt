<p>So what I did here is I took your suggestions and read up on why you were doing what you were. Seems I haven't learned Try and Except yet but I'm reading up on it. I'm very thankful for your help. I modified some things to make it work for me and very much learned from what you set up. Thanks again! Here's what I have as of now.</p>

<pre><code># guess the number game
from random import randint

print "Welcome to guess the number!"
print "You have 10 tries to guess the correct number!"
print "The range of numbers will be from 0-25"

# variables for the game
LO, HI = 0, 25
MAX_TRIES = 10


def main():
    # generate random number each game
    answer = randint(LO, HI)

    for _ in range(MAX_TRIES):
        guess = get_guess()

        if guess == answer:
            print "You Win!"
            break
    if MAX_TRIES == 10:
        print "Too many tries. You Lose!"

# function to determine if input was an int
def get_guess():
    while True:
        try:
            guess = int(raw_input("Please enter a number (0-25): "))
        except ValueError:
            print "Please enter a number: "
        else:
            if LO &lt;= guess &lt;= HI:
                return guess
            print "Please enter a number between %s and %s" % (LO, HI)


main()

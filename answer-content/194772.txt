<blockquote>
  <p>How do I know that I'm writing Good Code?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is a very broad question that can not be answered here. You can start by reading this classic book: <a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0132350882" rel="noreferrer"><em>Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</em></a> (at least you can tackle some chapters that can be understood for your case)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the sense, is it something similar to how a major Software
  Developing company would produce code for real problems?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately no; especially when it comes to games development where competition is too rude and various advanced technical skills from different aspects and fields are required (this means more specialists are involved)</p>

<p>The minimum you can think about at this level is that your code is not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_reuse" rel="noreferrer">reusable</a> as it is. To remedy to this, you should at least re-design it in terms of <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_functions.htm" rel="noreferrer">functions</a>. So if we start from @Rauch's answer, we could do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>import random


def simulate_dice():
   """This function is Dice Simulator that produce an Output from 1-6
   everytime the User presses Enter. In order to close the Program,
   the User has to type "Exit" into the console. 
   """
   print(" Hi! Welcome to Dicey!")
   print("""

    .-------.    _______
   /   o   /|   /\\      \\
  /_______/o|  /o \\  o   \\
  | o     | | /   o\\______\\
  |   o   |o/ \\o   /o     /
  |     o |/   \\ o/  o   /
  '-------'     \\/____o_/

   """)
   roll_number = 0
   msg = "Press Enter to Roll (or) Type 'Exit' to Close.\n\n"
   while True:
       if input(msg).lower() == 'exit':
           break

       roll_number += 1
       dice_value = random.randint(1, 6)
       print(f"{roll_number}&gt; You got a {dice_value}\n")

       msg = "Press Enter to Roll Again! \n"


if __name__ == '__main__':
   simulate_dice()
</code></pre>

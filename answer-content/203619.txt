<p>Just a couple suggestions...</p>

<p>It might be easier to setup sub-folders (dynamically) under Resources for each template that gets uploaded to store the associated files in. Then just tweak the links to point to that sub-folder. This way you don't have to serve up files manually and everything works as you expect with caching and compression and whatnot. Basically it's a static file on your server at that point.</p>

<p>For the parameters, I would use a single JSON object and return that to the client for consumption instead of setting up multiple header scripts like that. Then you have "templateModel.p1, templateModel.p2..." etc.</p>

<p>Also, if you haven't you should learn a client-side framework like Angular... this problem sounds like one that could leverage it to make rendering and binding and link adjustment MUCH simpler and more dynamic.</p>

<p>Lastly, performance for 30 users shouldn't be a concern. Unless the server that's running this is running 100 other things that are being pounded way harder I wouldn't worry. Fix performance later if it becomes an issue. And narrow the problem down to the exact choke point(s).</p>

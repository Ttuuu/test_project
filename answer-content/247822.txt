<p>Being on Linux I can't run your code right now but here is an idea.</p>
<p>I think the string concatenation must be <em>very</em> inefficient:</p>
<pre><code>strNewContents = strNewContents &amp; strLine &amp; vbcrlf
</code></pre>
<p>What you are doing:</p>
<ul>
<li>read the source file line by line</li>
<li>then concatenate to a big string</li>
<li>write the string in one go at the end</li>
</ul>
<p>What I think you should be doing:</p>
<ul>
<li>open the source file for reading, and the target file for writing</li>
<li>read the source file line by line</li>
<li>at each iteration, write a trimmed line to the target file</li>
<li>then close both files at the end</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it, read and write at the same time, that should solve your performance problem.</p>
<p>A better alternative to the string concatenation would otherwise be the stringbuilder class if available in VBA (I don't think so). I agree with the suggestion that Powershell would be a better option. Many things can be done with one-liners.</p>

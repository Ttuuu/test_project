<p>The first thing I'd suggest is break out code segments into functions.  This keeps your <code>Main</code> free of clutter and makes the flow easier to understand.</p>

<p>You don't mention which IDE you're using.  If it doesn't have the option for you to format your code according to acceptable guidelines, I would seriously consider changing programs.  There are several well established IDE's freely available.</p>

<p>Your, check for prime, algorithm, while naive, could do with some optimization.  Check for 0,1, and 2 separately.  If the number is bigger than 1 then add 2 to the list.  The loop should start at 3 and step by 2.  As was pointed out, all primes larger than 2 are odd.</p>

<p>There are much better algorithms for getting a list of prime numbers, not the least of which is the <code>Sieve of Eratosthenes</code>.  With this algorithm it is very easy to make a master list of primes then build the sublist that you want.</p>

<p>Here's a compact way of doing it, without using any loops or if statements.</p>

<pre><code>lst = [1,2,3,5,6,8,5,9,4,6]

def balanced(lst):
    return(sum(map(lambda x: x%2, lst))==0.5*len(lst))

print(balanced(lst))
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>map</code> function creates a new list consisting of 1's and 0's corresponding to each element in the input list.  1 means the corresponding element is odd, 0 means the corresponding element is even.  Then, the <code>sum</code> function is used to add up all the elements in the resulting list from the <code>map</code> fucntion.  This tells us the number of odd elements in the original list.  The result of the sum function is then compared to half the number of elements in the original list.  If the comparison is equal, this means that there are an equal number of odd and even elements in the original list.</p>

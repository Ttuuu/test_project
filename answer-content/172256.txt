<p>Merge <code>game_start</code> and <code>play_again</code> into one variable - note they already mean almost the same thing, and you never need both at the same time.  So call it <code>play</code> or <code>wants_to_play</code> or <code>keep_playing</code> etc.</p>

<p>That will allow you to collapse some of your repeated <code>if</code> statements and loops.</p>

<p>Note also that <code>dice_roll</code> doesn't just roll the dice - it also asks if you want to play again.  Don't do that - a function should just do one thing, not two.  Maybe <code>dice_roll</code> should just do <code>print("Your number is: " + str(random.randint(1,6)))</code>, or, in fact, maybe it should just return <code>random.randint(1,6)</code> and let other code worry about display - imagine if you wanted to make a GUI - try to keep the UI code from spreading everywhere.</p>

<p>so think how the game should work (this is not python):</p>

<pre><code>wants_to_play = ask "do you want to play"
while wants_to_play
   roll dice, display roll
   wants_to_play = ask "play again"
</code></pre>

<p>That should be all there is basically, right?
Can you fill it in from there? Turn that into Python?</p>

<p>P.S. maybe <code>ask</code> could be a function, that handles the bad input etc, and converts the answer to true/false.</p>

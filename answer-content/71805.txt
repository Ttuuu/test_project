<p>Take a look at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping" rel="nofollow">Object Relational Mapping</a>,
especially
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_impedance_mismatch" rel="nofollow">Object-relational impedance mismatch</a>
on Wikipedia.</p>

<p>Basically there problems with this as soon as it gets a bit more
complicated and you need to query e.g. a lot of objects at once, or you
have joins, and so on.</p>

<p>Let's take <code>$this-&gt;getRowFromPlayers</code>.  I'm assuming, that that method
will fetch <em>one</em> row from the database.  So you already have a
bottleneck here because you'll have to run <code>n</code> separate queries for
each of your <code>n</code> IDs when you want to get like a list of objects by
their IDs, which is very inefficient.  So you'll have to construct
objects from the outside, mapping a result of multiple rows from the
database to newly constructed (or cached) objects.</p>

<p>Another problem often comes up in that your objects don't exactly <em>are</em>
the table rows, they are just mapped onto objects, so testing by
identity is mostly meaningless unless you keep track of objects and
return the same object for the same row of a table.  It gets complicated
very fast.</p>

<p>Obviously there are already solutions for this, so I suggest you take a
look at existing PHP libraries for this.</p>

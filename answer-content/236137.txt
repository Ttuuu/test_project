<p>Using <code>reduce</code> to build a map object sounds wrong. By definition, the word reduce means "to make smaller", but you are using it here "to make bigger". A first step might be:</p>

<pre><code>const data = {};
_.foreach(arg.statistic, (key, value) =&gt; data[key] = value);
</code></pre>

<p>I don't know whether lodash actually has <code>foreach</code>, it's just to illustrate the idea.</p>

<p>There's probably an even more elegant way to create this map out of the data.</p>

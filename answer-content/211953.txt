<p>I suggest using an array of boolean, so instead of</p>

<pre><code>var storeOccurance = new Dictionary&lt;int, bool&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>use simply</p>

<pre><code>var storeOccurance = new bool[26];
</code></pre>

<p>Although if you want to allow a large character set instead of just a-z, say the whole of unicode, the HashSet approach may be appropriate, although in that case you would have to consider surrogates ( the situation where a character is represented by two chars ).</p>

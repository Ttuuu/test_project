<p>Since “Dining Room” (11 characters long) is west of the garden, you probably want </p>

<pre><code>west.rjust(11) + hzt_line + east
</code></pre>

<p>for your room map.  (You’ll have to increase your centering values to accommodate the additional characters.)</p>

<p>Since <code>['item']</code> is often in a room dictionary, the player can type “go item”, moving to the “item” room, crashing the game.  You should validate the move directions.  One way: instead of move directions stored as keys of the room, store them in a <code>'exits'</code> dictionary in the room.</p>

<pre><code>'Kitchen' : {
    'exits' : { 'north': 'Hall', 'east': 'Living Room'},
    ...
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>You can test for many similar conditions using <code>all(...)</code> and list comprehension.</p>

<pre><code>if currentRoom == 'Garden'  and  all(item in inventory for item in ('key', 'matchbox', 'knife')):
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>But really you want <code>inventory</code> to be a <code>set</code>.  Then you can test:</p>

<pre><code>if currentRoom == 'Garden'  and  inventory &gt;= {'key', 'matchbox', 'knife'}:
    ...
</code></pre>

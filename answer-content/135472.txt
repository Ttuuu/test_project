<p>This is not the classical backpack problem. Below, the problem that you want to try to solve.</p>

<p>You have a backpack, and in front of you there are n bags. Let us say three bags with different materials. E.g.: One for gold, one for silver, and another for copper. Each bag contains pieces of 1 unit (let's say 1g) for its material. You want to fill up the backpack in the way that you have the maximum value for the capacity of your backpack.</p>

<p>However, even with this specific proposition, there is a problem with the fragment below:</p>

<pre><code>if (totalWeight === sorted[index].weight) {
        index++;
}
</code></pre>

<p>For the first item, it would make sense, but then ... it does not. Maybe you should use another variable for <code>partialWeight</code> of each material. 
Ex:</p>

<pre><code>totalWeight++;
partialWeight++;
if (partialWeight === sorted[index].weight) {
        index++;
        partialWeight=0;
}
</code></pre>
    </div>

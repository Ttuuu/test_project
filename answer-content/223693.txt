<p>First of all: the code does not work, so this is not the appropiate place for your question (code review is to improve code which works). Having said that, I proceed to give you some help (next time, ask your question where appropiate).</p>

<p>card1 and card2 are taking values which are not numbers (look at what face_value() has as an output; it only prints strings which cannot be compared with '&gt;' but does not return any comparable values).</p>

<p>The code can be improved by adding a 'return player_card' at the end of face_value(). That way you ensure card1 and card2 will take the value of the numbers generated by random and you will be able to compare them.</p>

<h1>Redundancy</h1>
<p>I see a lot of code that packages stuff up and then moves it into another wrapper. For example, in <code>main()</code> you put a bunch of points into a <code>vector</code>, then you iterate over the <code>vector</code> and add those points to a <code>Striped_closed_polyline</code>. Why not just directly add them to the <code>polyline</code>? The <code>generatePoints</code> function could look like this:</p>
<pre><code>static void generatePoints(Striped_closed_polyline&amp; scp)
{
    scp.add(Point(50, 50));
    scp.add(Point(200,50));
    scp.add(Point(200,100));
    scp.add(Point(200,200));
    scp.add(Point(100,225));
    scp.add(Point(50,200));
    scp.add(Point(25,100));
}
</code></pre>
<p>Also in <code>draw_lines()</code>, you're putting points into a <code>vector</code>, sorting them, and then only using the first one. You don't need to sort to find the min or max. You can just iterate over them and keep a running min or max.</p>
<h1>Naming and Location</h1>
<p>The <code>IntersectPoint()</code> function is poorly named. 2 points are either coincident or they're not. But you're not finding the intersection of points, you're finding the intersection of edges. This tells me 2 things:</p>
<ol>
<li>It should be a part of the <code>Edge</code> class</li>
<li>It should just be named <code>Intersection</code> and take a second <code>Edge</code> as its only argument</li>
</ol>
<h1>Errors</h1>
<p>Why is the <code>Striped_closed_polyline::spacing</code> variable declared <code>static</code>? That means that every instance of that class will have the same value. If you want to have 1 with a spacing of 5 and another with a spacing of 10, you can't.</p>
<p>If <code>IntersectPoint()</code> does not find an intersection, it returns a valid <code>Point</code> with the coordinates (-1, -1). What if someone has 2 line segments that intersect at (-1, -1)? You should return a separate error code.</p>
<p>The lines in your drawing are not evenly spaced. I don't immediately see what the problem is, but clearly, the output doesn't look right.</p>

<p>You have a circular dependency. Your main file imports GameItems and Rooms, but classes that are defined in the main file are used in both GameItems and Rooms. <code>Items</code>, <code>DoorKeys</code>, and <code>Weapons</code> should be moved to GameItems; <code>Room</code> should be moved to Rooms. <code>world</code> is also best defined in Rooms.

<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>while( ( currchar = getchar() ) != EOF ){
        characters[currlinelen] = currchar;
        ++currlinelen;
</code></pre>

<p>This causes a buffer overflow (and undefined behavior) when the entered string is more than <code>MAX_ARRAYCHARACTERS</code>. A buffer overflow could crash your program, and can cause weird behavior. It is also considered a security vulnerability.</p>

<p>To fix this, I would suggest looking at <code>getline()</code> which is a safer method. Additionally, it doesn't have the <code>1000</code> character limit as defined in <code>MAX_ARRAYCHARACTERS</code>. Using this method would greatly simply this code.</p>

<pre><code>++currlinelen;
</code></pre>

<p>I would use <code>currlinelen++</code> instead as this is not being used in an assign operation and doesn't depend on the alternative behavior. It is a bit more readable this way too.</p>

<p>Here are some changes I'd recommend making:</p>

<p><strong>Code correctness and readability</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>It's best to end all lines with a semi-colon. The <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/javascriptguide.xml" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Google style guide</a> agrees with me on this, as does David Herman, author of Effective JavaScript (which you should read). JavaScript actually has quite complicated auto-semicolon insertion rules, so you can get unexpected results if you lazily rely on the auto-semicolon-insertion.</li>
<li>You should put some comments in. I shouldn't need to know anything about numerology to at least have a rough idea of what you're trying to accomplish with your function. Consider automating this process slightly with <a href="https://code.google.com/p/jsdoc-toolkit/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">JSDoc</a>.</li>
<li>Some people don't like direct manipulation of <code>innerHTML</code>. You can read up on that vs other <code>DOM manipulation</code> options in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9036995/is-it-wrong-to-insert-elements-using-text-and-innerhtml">this</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6364748/change-the-options-array-of-a-select-list">this</a> SO post. It's not really important to your code here, but you should be aware of this going forward. </li>
<li>You should always be using <code>var</code> to declare a variable, and you should always be declaring those variables at the top of your function since they will be <code>hoisted</code> anyway. Read more about variable hoisting in this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32645348/javascript-variable-hoisting-explanation">SO post</a>. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Efficiency</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><code>map</code> and <code>reduce</code> are widely supported by many browers. I suspect you read some outdated information. Check out this <a href="http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">table</a> of browser coverage of ECMAScript standards. So you should use them.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Robustness</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Your code is structured expecting a two-dimensional array as the shape of <code>arrayTotal</code> but this actually depends on the parameter <code>fn</code>. You should do some checking before you enter the second loop, since a user could pass in a <code>fn</code> that does not conform to this expectation (and similarly specify this expectation or requirement in your comments as to what the function does and what its parameters hsould be). This is a general comment and not specific to JavaScript though this particular problem is fairly specific to loosely typed languages like JavaScript.</li>
</ul>

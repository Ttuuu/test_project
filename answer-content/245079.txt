<p>Regarding the implementation of <code>CopyAsync</code> it will always copy the stream.<br>
<em>Can previous claims be applied to the copy as well?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your current implementation exposes two sort of operations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Move</li>
<li>Copy</li>
</ol>
<p>They are sharing the same signature (more or less). The <code>override</code> functionality is not controllable in case of <code>Move</code> from the consumer perspective.</p>
<p>The <code>Copy</code> operation is optimized to reduce latency (to take advantage of data locality) by branching based on the location of the drive. The same branching could be applied to the <code>Move</code> as well to provide symmetric behaviour. If it branches in the same way then extension in any direction (new driver location (for example Kubernetes virtual drive), new operation (for example Delete), etc.) would be way more convenient.</p>
<p>From readability and maintainability perspective it is easier to have symmetric functions, because after awhile (without any context / reasoning why <code>Move</code> does not apply the same optimization as Copy do) no one will know who and why did this.</p>

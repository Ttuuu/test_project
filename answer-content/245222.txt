<p>Sadly, the PHP part is neither efficient nor optimal.</p>
<p>Apart from already mentioned issues, your function does too much work, which makes it non-reusable and which bloats your code in general. Remember the rule of thumb: each unit of code should mind its own business. While your function interacts with a client through $_POST and echo, connects to a database, queries a database, formats the results. You have split it into several parts</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a <a href="https://phpdelusions.net/mysqli/mysqli_connect" rel="nofollow noreferrer">separate file to connect with a database</a> and just include it in every script that needs a database connection.</li>
<li>Create a function that performs a certain SQL query and return the results, so it can be reused for any other kind of request.</li>
<li>Write a code that handles a particular request from a client</li>
</ol>
<p>So the code should be</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php
require 'mysqli.php';

if($_POST["method"] == "requestBusinessFood")
{
    $rows = requestBusinessFood($mysqli, $_POST["category"]);
    echo json_encode($rows);
} 

function requestBusinessFood($mysqli, $categoryID)
{
    $sql = "SELECT * FROM foodtablebusiness WHERE category = ?";
    $stmt = $mysqli-&gt;prepare($sql);
    $stmt-&gt;bind_param("s", $categoryID);
    $stmt-&gt;execute();
    $result = $stmt-&gt;get_result();
    return $result-&gt;fetch_all(MYSQLI_ASSOC);
}
</code></pre>

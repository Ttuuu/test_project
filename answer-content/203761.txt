<p>There are some good points raised in comments about the requirements, and you really need to think about them in order to write code that solves the problem.  I can get you started with some feedback though.</p>

<p>Organize your code into a function, so that it's clear what the inputs and outputs are.</p>

<pre><code>StringReader reader = new StringReader(text);
while ((text = reader.ReadLine()
</code></pre>

<p>This is a really odd reuse of the variable <code>text</code>.  Declare another string, maybe called <code>line</code>.  But also reconsider if a line-centric approach is even appropriate.  XML is pretty free about where whitespace (including newlines) can appear - what if there is a break between the tag name and some attributes?  How will this affect your solution?</p>

<p>For the Regex <code>@"(&lt;.*&gt;)(.*)(&lt;\/.*&gt;)"</code>, note that all of these quantifiers are greedy, which may result in you capturing more than you want.  Of course, it may turn out with some clarified specs that a regex isn't even the appropriate tool to use here.</p>

<p>The question states you get one line but you operate on a list of strings.</p>

<p>Don't use end-of-line comments. They're hard to read and impossible to format.</p>

<p>Permutations can be generated with a simple recursive divide-and-conquer algorithm:</p>

<ol>
<li>If string length is 1, there is only one permutation.</li>
<li>For each character in the string

<ol>
<li>Swap character and the first one</li>
<li>Generate permutations for substring after first character</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>You need to pass the string, the index of the start of the substring and a collection where you collect the results through the recursions.</p>

<p>I think your code is already nearly optimal and Pythonic. But there is some little things to improve:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>cluster_count.sum()</code> returns you a Series object so if you are working with it outside the Pandas, it is better to specify the column: <code>cluster_count.char.sum()</code>. This way you will get an ordinary Python integer.</li>
<li>Pandas has an ability to manipulate with columns directly so instead of <code>apply</code> function usage you can just write arithmetical operations with column itself: <code>cluster_count.char = cluster_count.char * 100 / cluster_sum</code> (note that this line of code is in-place work).</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is the final code:</p>

<pre><code>df = pd.DataFrame({'char':['a','b','c','d','e'], 'cluster':[1,1,2,2,2]})
cluster_count=df.groupby('cluster').count()
cluster_sum=sum(cluster_count.char)
cluster_count.char = cluster_count.char * 100 / cluster_sum
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit 1:</strong> You can do the magic even without <code>cluster_sum</code> variable, just in one line of code:</p>

<p><code>cluster_count.char = cluster_count.char * 100 / cluster_count.char.sum()</code></p>

<p>But I am not sure about its perfomance (it can probably recalculate the sum for each group).</p>

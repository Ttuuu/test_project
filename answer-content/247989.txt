<p>Similar question is from Amazon interview where a missing number from randomly sorted 250 numbers i.e. 1 to 250, say stored in an array N, is to be found</p>
<p>I think it's simple</p>
<p>S=0</p>
<p>S=S+125.5 -N[i] where i = 0 to 249, looping it over 249 numbers, the value of S in the end is the answer and this approach can be generalized</p>

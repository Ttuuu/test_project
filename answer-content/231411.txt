<p>I would split off <code>player_count = 0</code> to a different line. Multiple assignments on one line is perfectly fine for simple assignments (like <code>a, b = 1, 2</code>), but a double list comprehension doesn't qualify for "simple".</p>

<h3>Readability Counts</h3>

<p>In general, Readability is far more important than conciseness. In fact, the reason concise code is often better is <em>because</em> it's more readable. </p>

<p>Normally, I'd be <strong>very</strong> careful with double list assignments for that reason. However, in this specific case, I think making it a single line is a good call. It's not overly long nor complex. </p>

<h3>Performance</h3>

<p>For pure python, I don't think you can really improve your performance even more. You won't get any issues until your password file grows into the MB's, and if that's a problem, you shouldn't be using a file with plaintext passwords anyway, since you'll be running your software in a production environment. </p>

<p>Instead, you'd be hashing and salting your passwords and storing them in a database, which is coincidentally also the best way to improve your performance if you get datasets that large.</p>

<p>However, as long as your username and password are requested from the user by means of the input() function, you won't have an issue. </p>

<h3>dict.pop()</h3>

<p>This function removes the value from the list. However, you don't seem to be actually <em>doing</em> anything with that value, and you're also discarding the list. So I'd just drop that line. </p>

<p>The only thing I can imagine you fix it would be to stop player2 from using the same credentials as player1. However, you don't save player references anyway. If you want to stop the same credentials from being used twice, I'd recommend to instead save references to the players for later, and then check that a player hasn't already been logged in as another player.</p>

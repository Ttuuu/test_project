<p>I'm wary of any name that has the words <code>And</code> or <code>Or</code> in it. It often indicates that something has too many responsibilities. Names like <code>HeapType</code> inside of a <code>Heap</code> class are also indicative that you should be considering some inheritance and an OOP approach. </p>

<p>I'm not saying for sure that it's better, but you may want to consider using an abstract base class that both <code>MinHeap</code> and <code>MaxHeap</code> derive their common functionality from. </p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>if (MinOrMax == HeapType.MaxHeap)
    flag = false;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Use brackets friend. Always use brackets. Better yet, do away with the <code>if</code> entirely and assign the result of an expression to your <code>flag</code>. </p>

<pre><code>flag = !(MinOrMax == HeapType.MaxHeap);
</code></pre>

<p>You calculate this value several times within several lines of code. </p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>(i - 1) / 2
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>It would be better to calculate it once and assign the result to a well named variable. </p>

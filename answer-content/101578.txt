<p>There are a few traps you're getting yourself into a bit.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>By definition your white rook starts at a specific spot.  What are you going to do for the other rook?</p></li>
<li><p>Also you're using class inheritance <code>White_Knight(chess_board)</code> in a funny way.  Please read this <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex42.html">quick chapter</a>.  In short, your implying that your white knight IS a chess board.  But your white knight IS a piece and so perhaps you should have a piece class and have white knight inherit from that.  Your chess board HAS pieces, so your structure should reflect that.</p></li>
<li><p>You're limiting yourself to a class which specifies color.  You should just have a knight class so that all 4 knights (on each side) can use that same class.</p></li>
<li><p>When I tell it my move I shouldn't have to tell it "Move white knight" because it should already know its my turn, so the white is unnecessary.  And the same time that doesn't tell us WHICH white knight to even move, so it is too little and too much information at the same time.  One way to have people input moves would be using standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_notation">chess notation</a>, so you can read up more on that and see if you want to use it.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider using inputs to your classes.  Suppose you had a class like knight.  You could initialize it with something like <code>board_x[7][1] = Knight(pos_y=7, pos_x=1, team='white')</code>  that way white and position are just properties of a broader knight class and you have a class that can be re-used instead of making a class specific to that one specific knight on the board.</p></li>
</ul>

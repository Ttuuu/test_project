<p>Using regex to parse valid html will work (and you might call it <em>beautiful</em>) until it doesn't work... then you'll bend over backwards (over and over) each time you encounter an anomaly then try to write a patch for the pattern.</p>

<p>Allow me to notify you of a simple, <a href="https://www.quackit.com/html_5/tags/" rel="noreferrer">valid html occurrence</a> that will break your sample pattern:</p>

<p><a href="https://3v4l.org/qjFpO" rel="noreferrer">Demo</a></p>

<pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="/html_5/tags/html_link_tag_example.css"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It would match because your <code>li</code> needle is not immediately followed by a word boundary character (<code>\b</code>). Is this a simple thing to fix? Yes, but my point remains -- regex is an inappropriate tool for parsing valid html.</p>

<p>I generally rely on DomDocument for most cases and when XPath makes life simpler, I use that to perform clean, readable queries on the document.</p>

<p>This is one time when focussing on speed is a moot point -- speed is the least of your worries.  What good is speed if the results are bogus? The goal should be to design a robust and reliable script using DOM-aware techniques.</p>

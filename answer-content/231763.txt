<p>I haven’t a clue what your code is supposed to be doing — there isn’t enough context — but from what I can see, I can tell that the code is horrible.</p>

<hr>

<p>The code reads roughly:</p>

<pre><code>this.mappedProducts.entrySet.stream().filter(...).collect(...);
System.out.println(...);
</code></pre>

<p>The method <code>collect()</code> returns a collection, which is not being assigned to anything, so the result of the <code>.collect(...)</code> call is discarded.</p>

<p>Why collect something when you are not going to keep it?</p>

<hr>

<p>The outer-most filter reads roughly:</p>

<pre><code>packList -&gt; {
    code_with_side_effects();
    return true;
}
</code></pre>

<p>A filter which unconditionally returns <code>true</code> is not a filter.</p>

<p>Filters should not have side-effects.</p>

<hr>

<p>The inner filter reads roughly:</p>

<pre><code>pack -&gt; {
    if (boolean_condition)
        return true;
    return false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is excessively verbose.  Your filter lambda could simply be:</p>

<pre><code>pack -&gt; boolean_condition
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<ul>
<li>Don’t <code>collect()</code> something you are not going to keep.</li>
<li>Don’t write filters which don’t do any filtering</li>
<li>Don’t put side effects in filters</li>
<li>If you want to returns true if a boolean condition is true, and false otherwise, just return the boolean condition.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>I’d love to help you improve the code, but I can’t tell what it is actually supposed to be doing, so I can’t actually write anything meaningful.  Please, add context.</p>

<p>Technically, you can’t edit the question after an answer has been given to the question, but for all intents and purposes, this isn’t an answer.  It is just a rant, and I’d love for it to be invalidated.  I’d be more than happy to delete it and answer a proper question, and actually help you improve the code, instead of just pointing out how flawed and broken it is.</p>

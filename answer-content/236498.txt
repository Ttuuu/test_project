<p>It would help Google and other crawlers if the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> also included:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;link rel="canonical" href="https://appropriate/url" /&gt;
&lt;meta name="description"
    content="Brief description that will appear in Google search results." /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In terms of coding style, using <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> (which should be <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code>), isn't pretty.
It also indicates that you are thinking of display format while writing HTML.
HTML code is for saying what things <em>are</em>, not how they should be displayed.</p>

<hr>

<p>For labelled input, one should use the <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> tag to definitively associate the label with the input area.
This will help software that reads your page, whether for SEO, or for accessibility For someone that can't see well, voice software can know for sure what the input field's label is, whereas with your original code it would have to guess.</p>

<p>There are two common ways of doing this.</p>

<p>By putting the input tag inside the label:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;label&gt;
    Firstname: &lt;input type="text" name="firstname" /&gt;
&lt;/label&gt;
...
</code></pre>

<p>or by listing the labels and inputs separately:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;label for="firstname"&gt;Firstname:&lt;/label&gt;
...

&lt;input type="text" name="firstname" /&gt;
...
</code></pre>

<p>The results are the same, so use whichever feels most appropriate for your code.
Either way though, do not include anything other than the label text (e.g. don't add an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> link inside the <code>&lt;label&gt;</code>).</p>

<p>Finally, if you don't like the default formatting that this produces, use CSS in the <code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;style&gt;</code> section to improve the appearance.</p>

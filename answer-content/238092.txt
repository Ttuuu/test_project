<p>You do not provide a testable function that performs the task of returning the desired answer for a specific test case. It is the ace handling that you intermangled with your test code. The main structure of your program structure should look somewhat like</p>

<pre><code>def calculate_player_hand(player_hand_input):
    #[...]
    return score

def read_tests():
    #[...]
    return testcases, answers

for test, answer in zip(read_tests()):
    assert answer == calculate_player_hand(test)
</code></pre>

<p>Completely separate the functionality you want to provide from the tests. even split into different files.</p>

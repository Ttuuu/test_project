<p>Since, there is an array of values, no need to iterate in the range, I think. Why not iterating between the array elements?</p>

<pre><code>Dim arr As Variant, sh As Worksheet, El As Variant
Dim refVal As Variant, boolWrong As Boolean, strDif As String
 Set sh = ActiveSheet
 arr = Application.Index(sh.Range("A1:AA1").Value, 1, Array(1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 24, 27))
 refVal = arr(1)
 For Each El In arr
    If El &lt;&gt; refVal Then
        boolWrong = True
        strDif = El
        Exit For
    End If
 Next
If boolWrong Then
    Debug.Print "Not all equal to first cell" &amp; vbCrLf &amp; _
                strDif &amp; " instead of " &amp; refVal
Else
    Debug.Print "All equal to first cell"
End If

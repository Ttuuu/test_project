<p>I'll answer your first question separately. However, since your second and third questions are closely related, I'll give the same answers to both questions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Am I following coding standards for Python 2 (like PEP8)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the most part, your code complies with PEP8,</p>

<ul>
<li>Spaces between operators</li>
<li>Two newlines between function definitions</li>
<li>Variables are lowercase with underscores as needed</li>
<li>etc...</li>
</ul>

<p>The only thing I'd suggest is to break some of your longer statements up - such as your <code>print</code> statement at the end of your script - onto separate lines, with each separate line being indented. </p>

<p>However, even if sometimes you choose not to comply with a certain coding standard, make sure you are consistent with your naming conventions. I've seen Python code which is written Java style, but is still easy to read because the author was consistent in their style.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there any way to make my code more "Pythonic" (like a native Python coder)? <em>and</em> Is there anyway to improve performance, readability, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>Instead of having the <code>list_of_chars</code> variable, make use of the <code>string</code> module which already defines all alphanumeric characters:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import string
&gt;&gt;&gt; string.digits + string.ascii_letters 
'0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Don't use global variables. There is rarely ever a good reason to use them. Instead of making <code>attempted_password</code> global, define it local to the <code>solve_password()</code> function. This makes much clearer where <code>attempted_password</code> is used.</p></li>
<li><p>Inside of your first <code>for</code>-loop, you never use the variable <code>letter</code>. Instead, simply use the variable <code>_</code> which conveys to the reader that your only using this loop for code repetition:</p>

<pre><code>for _ in range(0, random.randint(100000, 250000)):
    password += list_of_chars[random.randint(0, 61)]
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The builtin <code>range()</code> function will already start from zero if no other start value is specified. So there is no need to explicitly do it yourself:</p>

<pre><code>range(random.randint(100000, 250000)) # no need for setting 0
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

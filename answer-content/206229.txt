<p>Some suggestions:</p>

<ol>
<li>A linter (or two) such as pycodestyle or flake8 will help you write more idiomatic Python. For example, brackets are not required around an <code>if</code> statement.</li>
<li>You can use <code>query_posts_response.json()</code> to easily get JSON response content.</li>
<li>I can't see a reason why this script should do anything with the input and output streams.</li>
<li><code>db_connection.close()</code> should be in a <code>finally</code> block. The <code>try</code> block should start with creating the connection.</li>
<li>If you ever intend to reuse the code it should be wrapped inside at least a <code>main</code> function (which orchestrates argument parsing, handling exceptions which should lead to non-zero return codes, and the like) and a separate function to do the work.</li>
</ol>

<p>Solution without folds, effectively using a <code>filter</code> instead:</p>

<pre><code>l.lastOption.filter(_.isRight).map(_ =&gt; found).getOrElse(notFound)
</code></pre>

<p>I think it is a bit easier to read because every transformation is a single-function argument (as opposed to fold).</p>

<p>I found that <code>Option.filter</code> is a not-so-often used trick that can save what is effectively a conditional transformation in cases like that.</p>

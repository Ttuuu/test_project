<p>Unfortunately I am not experienced with Pandas especially on large files. But I would have tried a more 'native' solution like VBA but it is because I have some experience with it. There is a chance that VBA (in the form of a macro) would perform faster.</p>

<p>Perhaps you can try a hybrid approach, for example add some temporary columns to the files you are processing in Python, and fill those columns with formulae like COUNTIF etc.
The aim is to <strong>let Excel do the computationally-intensive stuff</strong>. And then you let your script loop row by one using the precalculations made by Excel.</p>

<p>When you are done, you remove the temporary columns or simply close the file discarding changes.
This may not be the more elegant approach, but I am not surprised that an interpreted language like Python with all the middleware involved is slow for this kind of task.</p>

<p>Another option is to dump the sheets to a database, MS Access or SQLite, add some indexes where appropriate and use SQL to fill out the gaps and then re-import the result to Excel.</p>

<p>This is more a hack than a real solution. My considerations would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>is this a one-shot operation or a process that you will have to repeat ? This is to answer the question: how much time and energy are you willing to invest in this ?</li>
<li>You have not mentioned the <strong>purpose</strong> of the Excel files, and you've not shared the structure or a data sample. 300K columns for an Excel file is very big. I am wondering if by any change you are on assignment with some corporate client where clerks <strong>use Excel like a database</strong>. This is a very common scenario unfortunately. Then I would advise them to use a better solution. The whole process and usage is flawed and the solution can hardly be elegant.</li>
</ul>

<p>Probably there are solutions already available on the market, including free and open source software. From experience there is little added value trying to patch a flawed process.</p>

<p>Everybody uses Excel, so Excel files proliferate everywhere and the result is poorly-structured data that is hard to exploit.
Using Excel is often the problem and the solution is to move away from Excel.</p>

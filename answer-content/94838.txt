<p>That's a lot of cases to enumerate.  You're basically doing all of the comparisons that a sorting algorithm would do, but you've "unrolled" the loop.</p>

<p>If you don't want to construct an array and sort it, then you could try this: check that the minimum and maximum differ by 2, and that all three numbers are distinct.  <code>Math.min()</code> and <code>Math.max()</code> are just conditionals packaged in a more readable form.</p>

<pre><code>public static boolean consecutive(int a, int b, int c) {
    int min = Math.min(a, Math.min(b, c));
    int max = Math.max(a, Math.max(b, c));
    return max - min == 2 &amp;&amp; a != b &amp;&amp; a != c &amp;&amp; b != c;
}
</code></pre>

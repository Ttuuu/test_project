<p>Prefer <code>&lt;cstdio&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;cmath&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;math.h&gt;</code> in C++ code.  You will probably never need the C compatibility headers unless you're writing headers that must also be included in C code.  The compatibility headers are less useful in C++ code, because they declare everything in the global namespace rather than neatly in <code>std</code>.</p>

<p>Prefer not including headers at all when you don't use them (as is the case here).  Unnecessary includes waste the compiler's time and the reader's brainpower.</p>

<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>if(state == NetworkState.LOADED) {
                        Boolean status = mLoginViewModel.getRemoteDataSource().getStatus();
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of having two separate if statement checks, this can be combined to check the NetworkState as well as call and check getStatus(), checking both conditions with an AND (&amp;&amp;) operator.</p>

<p>Be careful regarding white-space. Sometimes I see random newlines in your code. For the sake of readability -- it is beneficial to add newlines to separate parts of your code. But, use them sparingly, don't put newlines in random places where they don't belong, as that breaks the structural uniformity of your code.</p>

<p>Stick to one style for single line method bodies. In some places, you are doing this:</p>

<pre><code>public String getToken() {
    return token;
}
</code></pre>

<p>and in others, doing this:</p>

<pre><code>public Integer getBonus() { return bonus;}
</code></pre>

<p>personally, I and majority of Java developers would recommend the first style. But whatever you decide on going with, sticking to one particular style is the most important thing.</p>

<p>When you are writing a larger codebase, it's immensely important to keep structure in your code. Otherwise, reading over parts of the code become more difficult.</p>

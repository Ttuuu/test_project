<p>There is a module available for exactly that calculation, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/python-Levenshtein/" rel="noreferrer"><code>python-Levenshtein</code></a>. You can install it with <code>pip install python-Levenshtein</code>.</p>

<p>It is implemented in C, so is probably faster than anything you can come up with yourself.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/" rel="noreferrer"><code>docstring</code> conventions</a>, your docstring should look like this, i.e. with the indentation aligned to the <code>"""</code> and the line length curtailed to 80 characters.</p>

    """
    The Levenshtein distance is a string metric for measuring the difference
    between two sequences.
    It is calculated as the minimum number of single-character edits necessary to
    transform one string into another.

<p>I already gave many suggestions in <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/228978/120114">my review of your previous question</a>. I see that some of the advice has been incorporated - e.g. <code>"use strict"</code>, using the spread operator, etc. Yet it seems some of the advice hasn't been used (e.g. variables starting with <code>$</code>, using jQuery more, etc.) but I won't lose sleep about those.</p>
<p>I suggest avoiding use of <code>var</code> unless you have a good reason - e.g. you need a global variable.</p>
<p>In <code>createCartHTMLElements()</code> instead of appending to <code>html</code> each time, <code>map()</code> could be used to return the interpolated string for each row and then <code>Array.join()</code> could be used. Another option there is the HTML added in the <code>forEach()</code> callback could be stored in a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>&lt;template&gt;</code> element</a> though <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template#Browser_compatibility" rel="nofollow noreferrer">browser support</a> might be an issue.</p>
<p>In <code>updateQuantity()</code> instead of finding the index of the object to update, use <code>find()</code> to get a reference to the object and update that directly.</p>
<p>I see <code>updateOrderSummary()</code> has this variable:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>const shippingFee = 10;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>If that is a true variable, perhaps it should be declared at the top of the code:</p>
<pre><code>const SHPPING_FEE = 10;
</code></pre>
<p>I suggest ALL_CAPS because that is a common convention in many style guides to distinguish constants within code - like you did for <code>DELAY</code> (even though it was commented out) in your <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/q/219638/120114">blackjack code</a>.</p>

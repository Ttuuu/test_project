<p>I can see two issues related to security (but both do not pose an immediate threat being rather a potential issue):</p>

<ul>
<li>the insufficient hashing algorithm. Nowadays computers are FAST. Means they could calculate billions <em>ordinary</em> hashes per second. And, in case your database gets compromised, it would be rather easy to get raw passwords from it. A secure password hash must be <em>slow</em>. And PHP has one, implemented in the password_hash function. So instead of your own hash you must use a built-in function</li>
<li>I bet you never paid much attention to the error reporting part of your code, as your application seldom throws an error. Yet, when it happens, it's a complete disaster. An error message could contain a lot of sensitive information about your system. Not likely that it could be used directly to hack into your site, but it can help a hacker a lot. Besides, it just makes no sense to send an error message right away - a site user wouldn't make any sense of it. You chould forget about die() in your scripts. The best thing you can do is to leave the error message alone. </li>
</ul>

<p>The only other note I can make, there is a lot of rather useless conditions or the unused code. I rewrote your code based on the review above:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php 
//Connect to database
require("include/config.php");

//Check if something is posted
if($_POST){ 

    //Check if user exists
    $query = "SELECT * FROM usrs WHERE usr_email = :usr_email";
    $stmt = $db-&gt;prepare($query); 
    $stmt-&gt;execute([':usr_email' =&gt; $_POST['usr_email']]); 
    //Fetch result
    $row = $stmt-&gt;fetch(); 

    //If usr exists, check password
    if($row &amp;&amp; password_verify($_POST['usr_password'], $row['usr_password'])
    {
        unset($row['usr_password']);

        //CREATE SESSION 
        $_SESSION['usr'] = $row;

        //REDIRECT TO STARTPAGE
        header("Location: start.php");
        exit();
    } else { 
        echo "&lt;script type='text/javascript'&gt;alert('Fel uppgifter..');&lt;/script&gt;"; 
    } 
} 
</code></pre>

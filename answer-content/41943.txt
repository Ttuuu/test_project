<p>My first advice is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9pEzgHorH0" rel="nofollow noreferrer">stop writing classes</a> if you don't need to : your class has only two methods an <code>init</code> and a proper method. This could probably be written as a simple function.</p>

<pre><code>def word_count(phrase):
    word_dict = {}
    for word in phrase.strip().lower().split():
        word_input = ''.join(e for e in word if e.isalnum()).strip()
        if word_input:
            word_dict[word_input] = word_dict.get(word_input, 0) + 1
    return word_dict
</code></pre>

<p>Also, a lot of string processing you are doing is not useful, complicated and/or potentially wrong :</p>

<ul>
<li>On <code>phrase</code>, as noticed by Gareth Rees, there's not point calling <code>strip()</code> since you call <code>split()</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>As I wasn't aware that the result would be the same, here a proof of concept :</p>

<pre><code>a='  this  is    a little      test'
a.split() == a.strip().split()
-&gt; True
</code></pre>

<p>and here's a link to the documentation for <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#str.strip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">strip</a> and <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" rel="nofollow noreferrer">split</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>On individual words : the way you get <code>word_input</code> from <code>word</code> looks a bit convoluted to me. Among other things, there's no point in calling <code>strip()</code> on a string that only contains alphanumerical characters. Also, just removing "special" characters does not sound like the best option : <code>it's</code> and <code>its</code> will be considered the same way, its annoying :-). Maybe some characters like <code>'</code> should be taken into account during the splitting. Maybe, depending on the language you are to handle, other characters like <code>-</code> should be kept (for instance in French, "basketball" is "basket-ball" but neither "basket" nor "ball" are French words so splitting would be quite awkward and so would be removing the dash).</li>
</ul>

<p>Except for that, your code looks go to me!</p>

<p>However, if you wanted to make things even more pythonic, you could use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/collections.html#defaultdict-objects" rel="nofollow noreferrer">defaultdict</a>. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/893417/item-frequency-count-in-python">This example</a> will probably look familar to you.</p>

<p>Python has a recursion limit. By default, this is only about 1000 stack levels deep, and depending on your input, that cap might be reached by your recursion. </p>

<p>If you used the same input as the assignment did, then I have a rather hard time believing you timed out. Your function would be called only 1+2^4 = 17 times. </p>

<p>I ran it with the assignment inputs and it finished straight away.</p>

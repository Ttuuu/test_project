<p>To enhance portability to python 3 use <code>//</code> instead of <code>/</code> everywhere in your code. You already do this in lines like <code>q //= 2</code>, but not in lines like <code>x = pow(a, (p + 1)/4, p)</code>. In fact, consider including <code>from __future__ import division</code>.</p>

<p>Also, it seems that in a few benchmarks I did computing <code>2**x</code> was significantly slower than computing the equivalent <code>1&lt;&lt;x</code>. So that is another minor optimization that can be made.</p>

<p>Finally, again for portability to python 3, you can replace the one use of <code>xrange</code> with <code>range</code>. I do not think there will be any significant performance loss in python 2 in this particular case.</p>

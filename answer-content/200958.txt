<p>I like your implementation. It's simple and clear.</p>

<p>I would replace the setting of the row height using a bit more functional style, eliminating the local <code>height</code> variable, and slightly more compact:</p>

<pre><code>row.height = row.elements
  .map(el =&gt; el.firstElementChild.getAttribute('height'))
  .reduce((a, b) =&gt; a &lt; b ? b : a);
</code></pre>

<p>Another thing, I'm not sure if splicing arrays is very efficient. For creating the rows with 3 elements, it may be more efficient to use a counting loop with steps of 3, and working with index ranges instead of splicing. But that would be less idiomatic, and perhaps premature optimization. So I think it's fine as it is.</p>

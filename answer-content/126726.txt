<p>You write down your CSS properties in a random order. This is okay for small projects but can be tedious to maintain very quickly.</p>

<p>Create an order, in wich you set the properties for an element, and stick to it. It should look something like:</p>

<ol>
<li>Color</li>
<li>Size (width, height)</li>
<li>Position (position, bottom, top...)</li>
<li>Margins, paddings</li>
<li>Styling (borders, shadows...)</li>
<li>Etc. (animations, box-sizing...)</li>
</ol>

<p>Then the code for this specific one would look like</p>

<pre><code>#element {
    background-color: #007788;
    width: 800px;
    height:200px;
    position: absolute;
    left: 100px;
    top: 10px;
    margin: 10px;
    padding: 5px;
    border-bottom: 4px solid #003355;
    border-radius: 5px;
    box-shadow: 0 0 10px grey;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You don't need to include a property from every option.</p>

<hr>

<p>You should also break your CSS into multiple classes, for example you have the <code>border-radius: 6px</code> in a lot of places, that could have a separate class for it.</p>

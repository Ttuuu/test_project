<p>Very small comments to give some advice at this level:</p>

<ul>
<li>Try a bit better naming for functions, is vital for anyone that will read your code to help understand them. Imagine someone has to read for example your first function <code>Numbers(var)</code> and try and figure out what it does just with that name. I would suggest a naming like <code>is_digit(character)</code> where is easy to understand what the functions does (checks if something is digit) and what kind of parameter it expects (a single character)</li>
<li>Tedious comparisons of a single character, like <code>var == '0' or...</code> can be better written using python <code>in</code> operator. What about <code>var in '0123456789'</code></li>
<li>Same naming you can use for <code>def operator(operato):</code>, what about <code>is_operator(character)</code></li>
<li>The content of the while clause is a bit big, you may consider dividing it into functions</li>
</ul>

<p>Last but not least</p>

<p>You can easily check this for yourself. Just define a variable <code>std::size_t activeStudents = 0</code> in <code>Student.cpp</code>, which you increase in the <code>Student</code> constructor and decrease in the destructor. If at the end of <code>main</code> this variable has the value 0, you're fine.</p>

<p>Same for the <code>StudentDatabase</code>.</p>

<p>This approach is only appropriate as long as you are learning about memory allocation and resource management. As soon as you think you undersand these topics, you should use an automatic tool like Valgrind to do the boring work for you.</p>

<p>By the way, your code doesn't compile. The <code>Student</code> constructor only accepts a single parameter, yet in <code>main</code> you pass 4 arguments:</p>

<pre><code>new Student(name, surname, student_number, grade);
</code></pre>

<p>Next time you should better create a working example in your IDE, make sure that it compiles and then copy it directly to the Code Review question, without any furher edits.</p>

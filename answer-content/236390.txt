<p>You have picked a hard data structure and hard algorithm to solve it.  Specifically, you have your searchable list as a list of strings and need to parse and convert it for each search.  You then do linear searches.</p>

<p>If you are going to precompute or cache your search information, consider creating a dictionary where the keys are the words and the values are sets of item indices.  Then you search is anding the set of indices with the value of each word.</p>

<p>Alternately, if you are optimizing for code brevity, use a regular expression. If your search strings were like ':MyName:MyType:MyBatch:' You want to create an expression from your search like <code>:(word1|word2|word3):</code> and use </p>

<pre><code>NSUInteger numberOfMatches = [regex numberOfMatchesInString:string
                                                    options:0
                                                      range:NSMakeRange(0, [string length])];
</code></pre>

<p>and make sure it matches the number of words.   Yes, more work if you want to avoid the, er, inventive user, searching for "MyBatch MyBatch MyBatch".</p>

<p>Keep trying to make it prettier :)</p>

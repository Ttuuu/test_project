<ul>
<li><p>The chain joining</p>

<pre><code>if (neighbor.chain != null) {
    finalChain.join(neighbor.chain);
}
</code></pre>

<p>looks simplistic. Two or more neighbours <em>may</em> belong to the same chain. Such chain would be added to the <code>finalChain</code> more than once. I cannot say if that would cause a runtime problem, but surely raises some eyebrows.</p>

<p>Along the same line, the same liberty could be accounted for more than once. It is OK as long as you only interested in life vs death, but restricts the overall scope of the program.</p></li>
<li><p>I don't see how the suicidal moves are getting rejected.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Ko</em> handling and detection is obviously missing.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Honestly, there are too much issues to address.</p>

<p>First of all, your code is not safe from SQL injection, because of <a href="https://phpdelusions.net/pdo/cargo_cult_prepared_statement" rel="nofollow noreferrer">cargo cult prepared statements</a></p>

<p>Another kind of SQL injection is highly likely to happen too, as, due to the nature of the script, it would be natural to show the structure for the <em>user-supplied table name</em> which goes to the query unprotected.</p>

<p><code>FoxyCRUD::where()</code> is mis-named. it should be called <code>get_id_field()</code>. And so <code>get_specific_data()</code> as well, it should be named <code>find_by_id()</code> instead. Besides, your convention is not very reliable, the id field is not necessarily the first one. </p>

<p>All other conventions are clumsy as well, such as for the password or int fields. </p>

<p>Why the main functionality is taken out from the class? Are you going to write the same code for the every table instead of just calling a method()?</p>

<p>You should take a look at <a href="https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PSR-2</a> for the code formatting guidelines. </p>

<p>And the most important issue: your question is a borderline off topic as your code is barely usable in the real life, while the rules require a fully functional code from you. So try to use this code for something useful and then come back.</p>

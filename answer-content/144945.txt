<p>I found no direct way to reply to you RomanK, but I had to say thank you. So - thank you!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: sorry for the "Thank you", I guess.</p>

<p><strong>Another question</strong>: after thinking it through, does using a class for dealing and distributing the flop, turn and river make sense at all? Wouldn't I be better off just using a function for this? The more I think of it the less I see any reason for having this part of the code in a class - seems to be more of a problem than a convenience. </p>

<p>Essentially, after the hole cards have been dealt to the players, what remains in the <code>drawn_cards</code> list are the 5 cards for the board. All I need to do now is display them with a function:</p>

<pre><code>def deal_community_cards(street):

    if street == "flop":
        flop = drawn_cards[0:3]
        return flop

    elif street == "turn":
        turn = drawn_cards[3]
        return turn

    else:
        river = drawn_cards[4]
        return river    
</code></pre>

<p>and finally I'd use another function to "pritify" the card display. Wouldn't this be a better solution than creating a whole class for this?</p>

<p>Both @cbojar and @200_success' code solutions are great for this problem.  Linked list iterator is definitely more efficient for this problem as others have pointed out.</p>

<p>As a minor side note, in @cbojar's final solution, it's missing Gunman in the <code>ArrayList</code> initialization.</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;Gunman&gt; gunmen = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(NUMBER_OF_GUNMEN);
</code></pre>

<p>If you're interested: mathematically, this is Josephus problem with k = 2.  It was proven via induction, and details can be found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_problem" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

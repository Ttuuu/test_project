<p>Since you only use <code>already_seen</code> to check if <code>current_selector_text</code> has been seen, consider changing the type of <code>already_seen</code> from <code>list</code> to <code>set</code> (slight performance improvement).</p>
<p>The function name <code>down_the_rabbit_hole</code> is unclear as to what it does. This will confuse people who have not heard of this phrase before.</p>
<p>Since you are already checking for arguments with <code>if len(sys.argv) == 1 or sys.argv[1] in ('-h', '--help'):</code>, consider handling the case when more than 1 argument is given (rather than just ignoring the rest of them).</p>
<p>You assign <code>False</code> to <code>need_table</code>, but <code>need_table</code> is unused.</p>
<p>The line <code># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-</code> is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14083111/should-i-use-encoding-declaration-in-python-3">unnecessary in Python 3 under most cases</a>.</p>
<p>You only have 1 type annotation on line 125 (<code>selectors: cssutils.css.SelectorList = getattr(rule, 'selectorList', [])</code>). Is there a reason why none of the other variables have an annotation (or why just this line has one)?</p>

<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>Apart from what's already mentioned I would like to point out that
the file <code>super.picture.jpg</code> will be converted to <code>super.png</code></p>

<p>That can be a problem if someone runs your program in a loop and iterates through a folder with files named <code>anniversary.1.jpg</code> <code>anniversary.2.jpg</code>....</p>

<p>Instead, because you have used <code>endswith('.jpg')</code> you can just use a substring of length <code>filename.length - 4</code>.</p>

<p>In order to determine whether two numbers are co-prime (relatively prime), you can check whether their <em>gcd</em> (greatest common divisor) is greater than 1.
The <em>gcd</em> can be calculated by Euclid's  algorithm:</p>

<pre><code>unsigned int gcd (unsigned int a, unsigned int b)
    {
      unsigned int x;
      while (b)
        {
          x = a % b;
          a = b;
          b = x;
        }
      return a;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>if gcd(x,y) &gt; 1: the numbers are not co-prime.</p>

<p>If the code is supposed to run on a platform with slow integer division, you can use the so called <em>binary gcd</em> instead.</p>

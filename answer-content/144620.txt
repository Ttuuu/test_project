<p>Joe Wallis already mentioned this, but I feel this needs more emphasis:</p>

<p>I'd argue that the problem is not well suited for implementation as a class.</p>

<p>First hint: The challenge says "write a function".</p>

<p>Second hint: Your answer function creates an instance of your class and then discards it after getting the one information that is needed, it's "return value".</p>

<p>When still opting for implementation as a class, having the instances do all the work in their <code>__init__</code> method is bad style (and also a hint to write a function instead). Imagine creating many of those objects and then having to get the lucky triple count of only some of those. Now you have done a lot of calculation for nothing.</p>

<p>Also, naming the "return value" with a leading underscore is bad style. The leading underscore is a convention to indicate private attributes or methods.
Your "return value" is meant to be read from code outside of your class, and is thus not to be considered private.</p>

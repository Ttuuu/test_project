<p>There are a lot of loops in here. I would probably turn at least one of them into a recursive function; actually, refactoring <code>high</code> <code>low</code> and <code>pivotIndex</code> into <code>let</code> constants with recursion <em>should</em> be faster due to optimizations. (I'm not that good of an FP programmer to mock something up for you quickly).</p>

<p>Otherwise, one suggestion I'd make (just my preference), you have two major loops smooshed next to each other, perhaps another empty line could help readability:</p>

<pre><code>            // Partition elements such that:
            //   a[i] &lt;  pivotElement    for low &lt;= i &lt; pivotIndex,
            //   a[i] &gt;= pivotElement    for pivotIndex &lt;= i &lt; high.
            var pivotIndex = low

            while a[pivotIndex] &lt; pivotElement {
                pivotIndex += 1
            }

            for i in pivotIndex+1 ..&lt; high {
                if a[i] &lt; pivotElement {
                    swap(&amp;a[pivotIndex], &amp;a[i])
                    pivotIndex += 1
                }
            }
</code></pre>

<p>I would definitely try refactoring some of this to FP, then running it through some <code>measureBlock()s</code> in Xcode to see if it's faster.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

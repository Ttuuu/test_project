<p>One thing that is missing is <strong>validation of user input</strong>.</p>

<p>If you omit the colon you get this: <code>IndexError: list index out of range</code>.
If you enter an invalid time like 25:99 you obviously get inconsistent results. There is no point trying to process invalid input.</p>

<p>Fix: validate the input with a <strong>regular expression</strong> and capture values to hour and minute variables.</p>

<p>Then, reuse those variables, rather than repeating <code>time[0]</code>, <code>time[1]</code>. Type casting (<code>int</code>) should then be done at the source as well. Don't repeat unnecessary operations.</p>

<p>Proposed code:</p>

<pre><code>import sys
import re

input_time = input("Please input a time (HH:MM): ")

m = re.search("^(0[0-9]|1[0-9]|2[0-3]):?([0-5][0-9])$", input_time)
if m:
    hours = m.group(1)
    minutes = m.group(2)
else:
    print("Invalid time, try again")
    sys.exit(0)

# verification
print(f"Hours: {hours}, minutes: {minutes}")
</code></pre>

<p>To improve user experience, I have made the colon optional. Thus, 2359 will be treated like 23:59. This regex expects a leading zero in both minutes and hours, but you could change that. However if you decide the allow single digits, you will have to reintroduce the separator to avoid the ambiguity, because 01:08 can be expressed as 1:8 or 1:08 - without a separator you can't reliably tell hours from minutes.</p>

<p>Regular expressions are a complex subject and a full explanation is beyond the scope of this review. In short this expression validates a time in the range 00:00 to 23:59, with or without colon separator. The parentheses delimit the <strong>capture groups</strong> while the question mark indicates that the preceding symbol (<code>:</code>) is optional.</p>

<p>Note that there is a typo: <code>miunte_hand_degrees</code>. The danger would be that you assign another variable elsewhere in the code with the proper spelling (<code>minute_hand_degrees</code>) and you end up with two variables that are assigned different values, and you have introduced a bug in your program.</p>

<p>I have not verified the algo.</p>

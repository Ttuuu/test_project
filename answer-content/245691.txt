<li>Follow <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP8 style guide</a> for variable and function naming convention. Both the variables and function names should have <code>snake_case</code> names.</li>
<li>You can <a href="https://devdocs.io/python%7E3.8/library/functions#enumerate" rel="nofollow noreferrer">use <code>enumerate</code></a> to get index and value while iterating a list.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>For constant space solution, instead of using a list to keep track of current max and min products, use a variable for both positive product and negative product. If the current number is <span class="math-container">\$ 0 \$</span>, reset them both to <span class="math-container">\$ 1 \$</span> (They should be initialised as <span class="math-container">\$ 1 \$</span> as well). At the end of for-loop (inside the loop), keep updating your <code>current_max</code> value to keep track of max product encountered so far.</p>
<hr>
<p>As edge cases, you may also consider returning (or raising errors) when input was empty etc.</p>

<p>Others have given many great suggestions on the code style, but I'd like to point out that your code's behavior does not exactly match your description of what it should do. You said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I need to write code to prompt user to enter Fibonacci numbers
  continuously until it's greater than 50. If everything correct, screen
  show 'Well done', otherwise 'Try again'.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based on this description, it sounds like the code should be prompting for numbers continuously, even if they give you a wrong answer, until they give you a number greater than 50. Only then would you reveal whether they had gotten it correct or not.</p>

<p>I didn't see anyone else point this out, and the hardest part of programming is understanding exactly what your program should do. I may be understanding the description wrong, of course, but I would double-check that your program meets the problem specification.</p>

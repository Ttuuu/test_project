<p>A note on efficiency. Currently the code exhibit an exponential time complexity. It can be reduced significantly.</p>

<p>Notice that the same position is inspected more than once. For example, the opening sequences <code>3, 1</code>, <code>2, 2</code> and <code>1, 3</code> all lead to the same position. Further down the game the situation aggravates.</p>

<p>Keep track of the positions already inspected, and before diving into the recursion check whether it is still unknown. Since the position is just an integer (an amount of stones remaining), the cost of tracking is <span class="math-container">\$O(n)\$</span> space.</p>

<p>Further improvement is of course <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning" rel="noreferrer">alpha-beta pruning</a>.</p>

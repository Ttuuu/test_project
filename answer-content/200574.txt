<p>The best way would be to use the <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/distutils/version.py#L93" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>distutils.StrictVersion</code></a> as your sort <code>key</code> argument.</p>

<p>However, as you do not want to use <code>import</code>s, you may choose to copy the <code>_cmp</code>, <code>__eq__</code>, <code>__le__</code> and other comparison methods as applicable, from the source file linked above. You'd also modify the <code>parse</code> method to use <code>str.split</code> instead of a regex matching.</p>

<p>I do not think you'd have to worry about pre-releases etc.</p>

<p>Why I'd go with distutils is because it has <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/distutils/tests/test_version.py" rel="nofollow noreferrer">been tested since</a> a long time. Writing your own version would be prone to errors, and edge cases.</p>

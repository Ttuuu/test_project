<p>If you're going to use <code>const</code> for some variables, then use that (or <code>let</code>) for all variables. Avoid <code>var</code> unless you have a good reason - e.g. you really need a global variable and/or hoisting.</p>

<p>The variable <code>authResult</code> can be eliminated from function <code>isAdmin</code> since it only gets a default value assigned, which then gets overwritten before it is returned. The function could merely return the value from the call to <code>rolesBoundToAlias.some()</code>. The arrow function passed to <code>.some()</code> could be declared on the previous line if you want, in an effort to decrease line length. Actually you might be able to just use <code>Array.includes()</code> bound to the array of roles instead of an extra arrow function. </p>

<p>The name <code>adminRolePolicy</code> might be better named as <code>DEFAULT_ROLES</code>. I use all caps since it is more like a real constant that wouldn't change much - and could be declared outside the function if deemed appropriate. And while there is likely some overlap, <code>Dev</code> and <code>BaseUser</code> seem separate from the concept of <code>admin</code>.</p>

<p>Instead of calling the second parameter <code>policyOverride</code>, you could call it <code>roles</code> with the default of <code>DEFAULT_ROLES</code> - then there would be no need to assign the parameter to a different variable.</p>

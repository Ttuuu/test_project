<h2>Use Standards</h2>

<p>Use standard notations and representations whenever possible: see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)" rel="noreferrer">Algebraic Notation</a> for example.</p>

<h2>Avoid Global Variables</h2>

<p><code>Board.CHESS_BOARD</code> is a global variable. <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?GlobalVariablesAreBad" rel="noreferrer">Global variables are bad</a>. So instead of a global variable, pass the board as an argument to the method. It is very possible that a program may need to consider multiple chessboard states at the same time, so static variables are just unsuitable.</p>

<h2>Test and Fix Bugs</h2>

<p>pawn movement is buggy:</p>

<pre><code>if(((srcX==1 || srcX==6) &amp;&amp; (Math.abs(destX-srcX)==2)) 
        || ((srcX!=1 || srcX!=6) &amp;&amp; (Math.abs(destX-srcX)==1)) 
        &amp;&amp; srcY==destY) {
    return true;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You haven't checked for the emptiness of the destination square, and returned true.
A pawn can move forward, but cannot attack forward. In order to make the method clearer split it into canAttack and canMove</p>

<p>Buggy as well:</p>

<pre><code>if(Math.abs(srcY-destY)==1) {
    if(Board.CHESS_BOARD[destX][destY]=="--")
    return true;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Pawns can attack but cannot move diagonally.</p>

<h2>Use Conventional Formatting</h2>

<p>Non-standard formatting looks confusing, weird and unprofessional. When you are new to a language it isn't obvious to you, but when you get used to the language it's obvoius and jarring. Here are a few very common and widely accepted conventions that your code doesn't follow <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/codeconventions-141388.html" rel="noreferrer">from Sun's Java Code Convention</a></p>

<ul>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>A keyword followed by a parenthesis should be separated by a space. </p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p><code>if (</code>, <code>while (</code>, <code>for (</code>, <code>try (</code></p>

<ul>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>All binary operators except . should be separated from their operands by spaces.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>The expressions in a for statement should be separated by blank spaces. </p>
  
  <p>Example: <code>for (expr1; expr2; expr3)</code></p>

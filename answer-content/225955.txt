<p>This looks correct! Here are my thoughts on the code:</p>

<ul>
<li>Per <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP-8</a>, use <code>snake_case</code> for variable names and <code>PascalCase</code> for class names.</li>
<li>Use Python builtins. Python makes frequency counting effortless using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>collections.Counter</code></a>.</li>
<li>Unused variable: <code>lengthOfInputString</code>. A static code analysis tool like a linter can spot this.</li>
<li>Avoid variable names like <code>hashMap</code>. Something like <code>freq_count</code>, <code>seen</code> or <code>char_count</code> is clearer.</li>
<li>Avoid using <code>i</code> as the loop block variable in <code>for i in enumerable:</code>. Reserve <code>i</code> for index variables and prefer something like <code>c</code> or <code>elem</code> that describes the variable more accurately. </li>
<li>The function name, <code>checkPalindromeAndPermutation</code>, doesn't accurately describe what the function does, long as it is. I prefer <code>is_palindrome_permutation</code> or <code>palindrome_permutation</code>. </li>
<li>Remove all <code>print</code> statements from your functions to avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)" rel="nofollow noreferrer">side effects</a>.</li>
<li>While I'm not a fan of inline comments, the comments in this program explain the logic nicely (typo and horizontal scrolling aside). Consider moving them to the function docstring, though, which summarizes the entire function neatly and gets out of the way of the code.</li>
<li><code>actualCharactersInInput</code> can be replaced with <code>len(s)</code> assuming you don't mind stripping whitespace beforehand. Having a separate cached variable for holding <code>len()</code> is generally poor practice because the overhead of the function call is worth it to improve readability and reduce the risk of subtle bugs (<code>len()</code> and cached value going out of sync).</li>
<li>Use <code>foo += 1</code> instead of <code>foo = foo + 1</code> to increment an integer.</li>
<li><p>Branching inside the <code>for</code> loop doesn't make much sense since the length of <code>actualCharactersInInput</code> is fixed. It makes more sense to pick a branch and stick to it as a human might do naturally if performing this task by hand.</p>

<p>Instead of:</p>

<pre><code>for item in hashTable:
    if actualCharactersInInput % 2 == 0 and hashTable[item] % 2 != 0: 
        ...
    elif actualCharactersInInput % 2 == 1 and hashTable[item] % 2 == 1:
    #^^^ we can use elif since the conditional is disjoint
        ...
</code></pre>

<p>try:</p>

<pre><code>if actualCharactersInInput % 2 == 0:
    for item in hashTable:
        if hashTable[item] % 2 != 0:
            ...
else:
    for item in hashTable:
        if hashTable[item] % 2 == 1:
            ...
</code></pre>

<p>Luckily, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/">branch prediction</a> will make the performance impact negligible even if we apply the conditional inside the loop, so this is mostly about reducing cognitive load on the programmer and isn't a hard-line rule.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Here's a possible re-write:</p>

<pre><code>from collections import Counter

def permuted_palindrome(s):
    s = "".join(s.lower().split())
    odds = [x for x in Counter(s).values() if x % 2]

    if len(s) % 2 == 0:
        return len(odds) &lt; 1

    return len(odds) &lt; 2
</code></pre>

<p>This can cause a performance drop because of a lack of early return option. Benchmark the impact and make a call of performance vs brevity based on your use case.</p>

<hr>

<p>I recommend validating correctness on any algorithm that's easily written using a clear-cut brute force method:</p>

<pre><code>from collections import Counter
from itertools import permutations
from random import randint as rnd

def permuted_palindrome(s):
    ''' 
    Determines if a string is a permuted palindrome.
    A string is a permuted palindrome if:
      1. the string is of odd length and has 1 or fewer
         characters with an odd number of occurrences.
      - or - 
      2. the string is of even length and has no 
         characters with an odd number of occurrences.

    &gt;&gt;&gt; permuted_palindrome("aaa")
    True
    &gt;&gt;&gt; permuted_palindrome("aaab")
    False
    &gt;&gt;&gt; permuted_palindrome("aaaab")
    True
    &gt;&gt;&gt; permuted_palindrome("aaaabc")
    False
    &gt;&gt;&gt; permuted_palindrome("aaaabcc")
    True
    '''
    s = "".join(s.lower().split())
    odds = [x for x in Counter(s).values() if x % 2]

    if len(s) % 2 == 0:
        return len(odds) &lt; 1

    return len(odds) &lt; 2

def brute_permuted_palindrome(s):
    return any(x == x[::-1] for x in permutations("".join(s.lower().split())))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    tests = 1000
    passes = 0

    for x in range(tests):
        s = "".join(chr(rnd(65, 70)) for x in range(rnd(1, 10)))

        if brute_permuted_palindrome(s) == permuted_palindrome(s):
            passes += 1

    print(f"passed {passes}/{tests} tests")
</code></pre>

<p>Randomization doesn't guarantee perfect coverage, but it's an easy way to be pretty certain your code works and can often catch edge cases that might be overlooked in enumeration (best to do both). </p>

<p>This snippet also shows how you might include a full docstring with doctests and uses the <code>if __name__ == "__main__":</code> guard which makes your module easily importable.</p>

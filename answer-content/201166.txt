<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>I'll stand on Mark Seemann's shoulders:</p>

<pre><code>displayConnectionAction = withReader currentPlayer $ do
  connected &lt;- asks playerConnected
  if connected
    then return Nothing
    else asks $ Just . Action "Connect" "/connect" . playerId
</code></pre>

<p>I wouldn't qualify field names with what records define them, it leads to redundant name dropping in compositions.</p>

<p><code>MaybeT</code> (or equivalently <code>ReaderT r Maybe</code>) can do us one better:</p>

<pre><code>displayConnectionAction =
  withReader currentPlayer $ runMaybeT $ do
    False &lt;- asks playerConnected
    asks $ Action "Connect" "/connect" . playerId
</code></pre>

<p>With more context, next steps may include checking whether <code>Action</code> is consumed in only one place, and if so whether we can produce what it's turned into immediately. If a connected player means a presence of player data which would be obtained by the connection action, <code>&lt;|&gt;</code> could capture that pattern so we can get rid of that stinky boolean handling.</p>

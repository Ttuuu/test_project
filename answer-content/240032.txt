<p>I don't know why you are surprised plain loops are faster, without an explanation of why you were surprised, it is hard to comment on that. Linq is bound to have some overhead. </p>

<p>By vectorisation I guess you mean the use of special machine instructions, I doubt these would have any significant effect here. Most of the comparisons will fail at the first letter, so I don't see how a special string compare instruction would help.</p>

<p>Your code looks fine except for two points:  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>a <code>Dispose()</code> method should never throw an exception but yours will likely throw one if it is called twice. This can be avoided by having a <code>private bool disposed</code> variable which is checked by an <code>if</code> condition.  </p></li>
<li><p>an event based method <code>OnXXX</code> is usually either <code>private</code> or <code>protected</code> and used to actually raise the event. A simple rename to <code>ClipboardChanged</code> will be sufficient to handle that issue.</p></li>
</ul>
    </div>

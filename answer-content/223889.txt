<p>These declarations are not prototypes:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>void getDataFromRapidSrcFile();

int getTotalPositions();
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>These declare functions that can be called with any number of arguments.  It appears that they should take no arguments; we indicate that like this:</p>

<pre><code>void getDataFromRapidSrcFile(void);

int getTotalPositions(void);
</code></pre>

<p>It's a good idea to make the same change where the functions are defined, too.</p>

<hr>

<p>You could remove a repetitive (error-prone) construct using a macro to determine the number of elements in an array:</p>

<pre><code>#define ARRAY_SIZE(x) (sizeof (x) / sizeof (x)[0])
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Sorry I didn't get time for a full review of this - you do have a few other good answers now, though.  If you ask a new question to review your improved code, then I hope to be able to look at that.</p>

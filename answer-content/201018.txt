<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>I tried </p>

<pre><code>/\b[^e]+\b/i
</code></pre>

<p>for the first time too, but the problem with it, is that it also returns true to inputs such as "444fortyfortyfour", where there are digits in the word.</p>

<p>The book says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol start="7">
  <li>A word without the letter e (or E)</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>I had come up with the following solution:</p>

<pre><code>let regExp = /\b[a-df-z]+\b/i

regExp.test("Anything")
// true

regExp.test("Except 'e'")
// false

regExp.test("0r th1s")
// false
</code></pre>

<p>It does not look like a nice solution, but it does the job. I am interested in a more elegant solution though.</p>

<p>PS: don't forget to add the letter 'i' for case insensivity!</p>

<p>This list implementation seems to work only for one high score list.
If the program need an another high score list in future, then this implementation won't be usable without modifications.</p>

<p>If you want to create a linked list, I recommend to create more re-usable implementation:</p>

<ol>
<li>List can store any kind of types.</li>
<li>There can be zero, one or several linked lists in one application. </li>
<li>Put the list implementation to separate C and H file. </li>
</ol>

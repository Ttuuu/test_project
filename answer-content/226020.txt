<ul>
<li>The long comment at the beginning of the class is good class documentation and should be made into a docstring. The same applies for functions.</li>
<li>Avoid variables in all caps, like <code>START</code> (unless they are constants).</li>
<li>Functions and variables should generally use snake-case, if you want to follow Python conventions as in PEP 8.</li>
</ul>

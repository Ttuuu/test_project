<p>Here are a few issues with your code</p>

<ul>
<li>If older browsers aren't a concern, you can just use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>fetch</code></a> instead of XHR. It's built-in and uses promises.</li>
<li>HTTP 200 isn't the only "successful" response status. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes</a>.</li>
<li>Status "0" is a generic network error, not just being offline. It can also be caused by the browser suppressing the request due to some restriction, an extension blocking the request, an insecure connection/invalid certificate.</li>
<li>Send an <code>Accept</code> header with <code>application/json</code> as value. This is because, while the server might support JSON, it might not respond with it by default.</li>
<li>The third argument of <code>xhr.open</code> is by default <code>true</code>. You may omit that third argument.</li>
<li>You can use <code>readystatechange</code> with <code>addEventListener</code> instead of the <code>onreadystatechange</code> property to assign your callback.</li>
</ul>

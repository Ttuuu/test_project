<p>Let's go through some basic rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>Everything is divisible by 1.  </li>
<li>If something is divisible by 16, then it's divisible by 2, 4, and 8.  </li>
<li>If something is divisible by 9, then it's divisible by 3. </li>
<li>If something is divisible by both 16 and 9, then it's divisible by 6, 12, and 18.  </li>
<li>If something is divisible by both 16 and 5, then it's divisible by 10 and 20.  </li>
<li>If something is divisible by both 16 and 7, then it's divisible by 14.</li>
<li>If something is divisible by both 9 and 5, then it's divisible by 15.</li>
</ul>

<p>That leaves:  5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 16, 17, 19.  Multiply those together and you get </p>

  <p> 232,792,560</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which of course is the answer.  </p>

<p>Some of the other answers may have written the code to generate this list in general (i.e. for values other than 20).  They don't seem to have commented the code in a way that's making it clear to me what they're doing.  </p>

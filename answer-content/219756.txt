<p>One thing I notice is that, you use global variables. While they are not necessarily bad and work fine in this particular case, it might be beneficial to read these <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19158339/why-are-global-variables-evil">answers</a>. It would be better to define these variables in main function and pass them as parameters for other functions.</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>def start_game(number, counter):
  #Your code here

def main():
  number = 0
  counter = 0
  start_game(number, counter)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
</code></pre>

<p>Calling the function within its body is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion" rel="nofollow noreferrer">recursion</a> and as long as you assure that the calling sequence won't become an infinite loop, it is widely used technique in programming.</p>

<p>One more minor thing: you define <code>val = int(guess)</code> but never use it, maybe delete it?</p>

<p>Other than that, everything looks fine and the code is readable.</p>

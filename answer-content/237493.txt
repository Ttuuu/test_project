<p>I think I overlooked the obvious.  Without sorting, if you do the loops as:</p>

<pre><code>def arraySum2(inputs, tests):
    my_set=set(inputs)
    for a in inputs:
        for b in tests:
            if (b-a) in my_set:
                return True
    return False
</code></pre>

<p>Then you get <span class="math-container">\$O(n m + n)\$</span></p>

<p>This will be faster than the original (or itertools based variants) around <span class="math-container">\$m&lt;{{n-1}\over{2}}\$</span> as the original does <span class="math-container">\${n(n-1)}\over2\$</span> tests and this does <span class="math-container">\$n m\$</span>.</p>

<p>If you are doing the test a lot, it is thus worth implementing both forms, with a test to decide which form to use.</p>

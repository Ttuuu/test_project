<p>Would you please check <code>read_train_set</code> function and make sure 20% of validation data consist of all seven classes? It's preferred to have all classes balanced in the training and testing data set. One way to do it is to split the data per class. Adding a dropout layer in CNN might help reduce over-fitting. The model might be able to detect 'happy' from 'sad' better than detect 'surprise' from 'fear'. A more detailed validation accuracy analysis will show some insight.</p>

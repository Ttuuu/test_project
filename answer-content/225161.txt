<p>I'll attempt to make two points:</p>

<ol>
<li>Differentiate where Strings are held in a pool; and,</li>
<li>Evaluate the code-duration where the sting value is held (i.e. start-to-finish number lines of code).</li>
</ol>

<p>Since Java 11 (if I recall correctly), all strings not using Unicode are byte arrays.  So the discussion should be about whether the reference to a string is shared (within a pool) and how long the memory of its contents exist.</p>

<p>Code that creates a string without thy key word 'new' (e.g. <code>String monthStr = "";</code>) will create the string reference in a pool shared within the JVM.  I do not recommend sensitive data in a shared pool of strings.</p>

<p>Since you are performing string manipulation, I recommend the StringBuilder class.  This class uses a character array.  You should be able to avoid false-positive code scans with this class.  As soon as you are done with the contents of the StringBuilder class you should clear its memory with either: <code>expDetails.replace(0, expDetails.length(), "*");</code> or <code>expDetails.delete(0, expDetails.length());</code>  If you continue with your byte array solution I recommend implementing code that writes over the array data after you call the <code>.put(...) method</code>.</p>

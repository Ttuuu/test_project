<p>Two minor remarks:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>For consistency sake, this</p>

<pre><code>accumulator = maxLastPair &gt; accumulator + addend ? maxLastPair : accumulator + addend;
</code></pre>

<p>can be implemented similar to the other statements as </p>

<pre><code>accumulator = Math.Max(maxLastPair, accumulator + addend);
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Some comments would be welcome in the loop. What exactly is the idea behind the different variables you keep. It took me a while to convince myself that your method was working as it should.</p></li>
</ol>

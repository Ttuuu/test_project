<p>Very brittle solution (for example, case mismatch, e.g. "miso" vs. "Miso", will fail to retrieve the required answer), but short and to the point (with plenty of room to improve robustness):</p>

<pre><code>let brands = ["Hayo"; "Miso"; "The Master"; "Vector"]
let product = "Miso power vacuum X100"
List.collect (fun (elem: string) -&gt;
                    if product.Contains(elem) then
                        [elem]
                    else
                        []) brands |&gt; printfn "%A"
</code></pre>

<p>P.S. Some may say otherwise, but I feel lists are more idiomatic to F# than arrays.</p>

<p><strong>Single responsibility</strong> </p>

<p>You represent the board as list but the board have specific actions that can be done: rotate left, rotate right, take from left, take from right. </p>

<p>I suggest creating a class with the above functions. </p>

<p><strong>Separate to functions</strong></p>

<p>You are doing few things in Solve: finding the char, rotate the board, take the char from the board. Separate each to a function. </p>

<p>Hint: look at your comments</p>

<p>My advice is, when writing code, to write kind of pseodo code for the "main" function. Only when you finish it start implementing the missing functions. </p>

<p><strong>For loop</strong></p>

<p>You can replace the for loop on the word to foreach. </p>

<p><strong>Static</strong></p>

<p>You post only static method. In c# you must have a class so create a class with non static method. </p>

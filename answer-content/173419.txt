<p>The implementation of <code>GetGCD</code> is more complicated than it needs to be.
The <code>Math.Max</code> and <code>Math.Min</code> wastefully evaluate <code>x &lt; y</code> more than needed,
because when you know that <code>x</code> is the max, you also know that <code>y</code> is the min.
And you perform these multiple times per iteration,
and in addition to that <code>x &lt; y</code> one more time.</p>

<p>Consider this alternative:</p>

<pre><code>static int gcd(int x, int y)
{
    while (y != 0)
    {
        int tmp = x % y;
        x = y;
        y = tmp;
    }

    return x;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You don't need to worry about whether <code>x</code> or <code>y</code> is bigger.
It's ideal when <code>x &gt; y</code>,
but if it isn't,
this algorithm swaps them.
The only cost is one more iteration of the loop,
but this is still cheaper than what you had previously with all the <code>Math.Max</code> and <code>Math.Min</code>.</p>

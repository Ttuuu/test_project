<p>In addition to the other feedback you've gotten, I wanted to comment on this:</p>

<pre><code>package stringBuilder;
</code></pre>

<p>Java recommends using an inverted domain name such as <code>com.example.something</code> to avoid collisions between package names. I see a lot of code on here like this that I assume (no offense intended) is from beginners that just makes up an arbitrary package name, and I think that's a bad idea. It only costs about $5 - $10 to get your own domain name, but if you don't want to do that you can either use a package name based on a domain you're affiliated with (such as your educational institution, although that wouldn't guarantee no collisions) or you can just leave out the package declaration and leave your class in the unnamed, anonymous package.</p>

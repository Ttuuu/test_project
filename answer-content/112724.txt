<p>In addition to Heslacher's advice, I'd also suggest you to move most of the logic to a separate class, e.g. <code>MessageGenerator</code>, and call that one from the <code>Main()</code>.</p>

<p>Yes, the current program is small, and even smaller when you apply Heslacher's advice, but IMO you should get in the habit of keeping <s>the <code>Main()</code> of</s> your <code>Console</code>'s <code>Program</code> as small as possible, and more importantly have dedicated classes that handle your logic.</p>

<p>Note that currently the data in <code>Greetings</code> etc. is fairly limited, but what if there are dozens of different message parts in the future? Consider moving those arrays to a separate class, and perhaps even to a config file.</p>

<hr>

<p>Much of your message is also repeated in the various parts. Each of your <code>Greetings</code> contains ", you have a", each of your <code>Garments</code> contains a ".". Those should be moved to the line that generates the message, perhaps something like this:</p>

<pre><code>return string.Format("{0}, you have a {1} {2}.{3}", 
                     greeting, compliment, garment, farewell);
</code></pre>

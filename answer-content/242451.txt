<p>Your Main method is too long, to be able to even see what it does I had to read the whole method.</p>

<p>You did explain what it does:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It asks for the user's birth day and month, and gives it back with the day a discount reminder email will be sent (the day before their birthday)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However by using classes and sub-method your Main-method could be telling you exactly this.</p>

<pre><code>class Program
{
    class MyDate {
       // ...
    }

    static void Main(string[] _)
    {
        MyDate birthday = ask_for_birthday();
        MyDate email_day = day_before(birthday);
        output_email_message(email_day);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you structure your code like that it will be much easier to critique and analyse further. 
If you use the already existing Date class of C# the day_before() method will probably pretty simple to implement even.</p>

<p>You should <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1452721/why-is-using-namespace-std-considered-bad-practice">avoid</a> <code>using namespace std</code>.</p>

<p>The code in the <code>prompt</code> function is not indented.</p>

<p>You should avoid using <code>endl</code> unless absolutely necessary (use a <code>\n</code> instead).  <code>endl</code> will flush the output buffer which can be a big performance hit.</p>

<p>You don't have a <code>break</code> statement for the <code>default</code> case of your switch statement.  While not required here, it can lead to problems in the future if additional cases are added after the default and the break is not added.</p>

<p>Declaring uninitialized variables within a switch statement is legal, but can lead to confusion.  Usually when variables are declared under a <code>case</code>, the code of the case is enclosed within <code>{</code> curly brackets <code>}</code>.  For example, the <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> variables, which are used in most of the cases, could be declared before the switch.</p>

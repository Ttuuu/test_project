<p>One thing that immediately jumps out at me is, that you don't use a finally-block to free the lock (as is recommended in the according javadoc btw.), i.e. if there's a single exception in processing, your whole code will be basically dead, as the lock will never be freed anymore.</p>

<p>Thus, to cite the docs, I'd rather do:</p>

<pre><code>commandLineCacheLock.lock();
try {
    // do all the processing here
}
finally {
    commandLineCacheLock.unlock();
}
</code></pre>
    </div>

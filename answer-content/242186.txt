<p>No.</p>

<p>Or well, maybe you <em>could</em> but I absolutely do not see any reason to do so.</p>

<p>What each <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> has in common:</p>

<ul>
<li>The same class</li>
<li>They all have <em>a</em> click event and <em>a</em> keyup event</li>
</ul>

<p>What each <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> has different:</p>

<ul>
<li>They all have different handlers for what to do on the click/keyup event</li>
<li>They all have listen for different keyup events.</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't see any benefit in creating a loop from this.</p>

<p>Some things you <em>might</em> want to consider though is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have a method that is performed for both click and the keyup event, to not copy-paste code between the different handlers.</li>
<li>Create a component for <code>&lt;span class="calc-button-control"&gt;</code></li>
</ul>

<p>If you have plenty of more of these <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements, creating a component would be the way to go. Then you could have a component to handle the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> element and applies the <code>calc-button-control</code> class.</li>
<li>It has a method for what to do when clicked or keyup event triggers.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am not sure how flexible you can make the <code>keyup</code> listener, I don't think you can for example pass <code>:keypress="enter"</code> or similar to have it listen to <code>@keyup.enter</code> so I am not sure if creating a component for all of this does more harm than good.</p>

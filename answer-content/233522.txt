<p>Hard coding your data can be lengthy and it can restrict flexibility when carrying out further analysis. You can shorten your code with list comprehension. </p>

<pre><code>import random

n = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

def main(val):
  ls = [i for i in random.choices(n, k=val)]
  ns = sum(ls)/len(ls)
  print('Length of Data : {}\nSum of Data    : {}\nAverage of Data: {}\nRandom Gen Data: {}'.format(len(ls), sum(ls), ns, ls))

main(100) #Enter amount of data you want to pass through the function
</code></pre>

<p>This returns:</p>

<pre><code>Length of Data : 100
Sum of Data    : 399
Average of Data: 3.99
Random Gen Data: [7, 4, 0, 8, 8, 0, 6, 7, 6, 4, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 4, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 4, 6, 5, 3, 0, 6, 0, 7, 0, 0, 4, 3, 7, 7, 9, 5, 3, 5, 2, 0, 4, 1, 1, 5, 8, 9, 0, 3, 2, 7, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 5, 7, 5, 7, 1, 6, 2, 7, 7, 5, 1,6, 6, 4, 7, 8, 2, 0, 1, 5, 3, 5, 4, 9, 7, 7, 2, 0, 3, 4, 6, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6, 3, 0, 1, 3, 8, 0, 1]

<p>It isn't necessary to use a <code>while</code> loop in this instance because you will still need to break your loop which is the same as giving a start and end value to a random range reference.  </p>

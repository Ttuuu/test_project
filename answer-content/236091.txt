<p>Here are a few tips:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Do not use <code>select *</code>, instead type out all the columns you need to insert into. It should be done in both your select and insert statements.</p></li>
<li><p>For the subquery in the <code>where</code> clause, you can store the result from that query in a temp table and then use that temp table for the where clause so it does not need to check while inserting the data.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to add an index to your tables which are unique so you can do faster and more efficient queries.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Some thoughts from a non-game-developer:</p>

<ul>
<li>The second and subsequent <code>if lowestKey</code> should use <code>elif</code> to short-circuit the evaluation when it finds a match.</li>
<li>I believe algorithms such as A* (A-star) are very well suited to find the shortest path between two points on a 2-dimensional map.</li>
<li>Running this code through a linter such as <code>flake8</code> will show how to make your code more pythonic.</li>
</ul>

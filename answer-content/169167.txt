<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p><code>.pop(0)</code> would remove the first element from a list - this is a \$O(n)\$ operation since everything after must "shift" (<a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Time Complexity reference</a>).</p>

<p>I would not pop from <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> subarrays and instead keep track of indexes in both the <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> lists:</p>

<pre><code>def merge(left, right):
    merge_result = []

    left_index = right_index = 0
    while left_index &lt; len(left) and right_index &lt; len(right):
        if left[left_index] &gt; right[right_index]:
            merge_result.append(right[right_index])
            right_index += 1
        else:
            merge_result.append(left[left_index])
            left_index += 1

    merge_result += left[left_index:]
    merge_result += right[right_index:]

    return merge_result
</code></pre>

<p>And, if you are preparing for an interview, make sure to write this function from memory couple times - it'll persist in your memory pretty soon - focus on the pattern (using left and right indexes for merging), don't try to remember the code line-by-line.</p>

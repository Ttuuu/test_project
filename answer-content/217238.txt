<p>It looks like both of the events are validating the same party and context objects. If those are the same type you could make a method to validate the profile, and a method to validate the context object. If the objects are different but you have control over the classes you could make both party objects implement an interface with getters for all of the fields being retrieved. If the objects being retrieved are different you can continue with the same pattern. In my opinion this method would be much easier to read if it was broken up to smaller methods that validate one thing, such as the name of the party.</p>

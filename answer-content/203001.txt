<p>More functions. If you are copy and pasting code it should be in a fucntion call, not another repeat.</p>

<p>Your call to welcome() should be underneath an <code>if __name__ == '__main__':</code> block as it is pythonic. </p>

<p>You have three different languages but the execution is all the same so you only need a third of the code that you have.</p>

<p>You make another call to welcome inside of it, but without any utility gained, you just plop another namespace on top which is not an effective solutoin. I would recommend doing something like running this in a loop until you get your desired input. </p>

<p>If you want to be generating URLs then typically they can be chuncked and treated as concatenations of the different parts of URLs, rather than hard coding lots of pieces over and over. </p>

<p>You have a block if multiple = y or = n, but then inside you have almost identical code, why is the multiple not a conditional later -- these lines also do not have to be repeated. </p>

<p>You also don't have to create a query for multiple vs singular, a user can just keep entering PIDs until they say that they have finished. This logic will be a lot kinder. </p>

<p>Your very long print string would be much more readable as a multi-line string, or even you could use the textwrap library. </p>

<pre><code>'This is one'
'singular'
'long string in python. It will be parsed as if there are'
'no breaks in it\n except for where I put\n newlines!!'
</code></pre>

<p>The thing is, there is not much to test in your code. You have added several abstractions to a simple statement:</p>

<pre><code>if (isValid($data)) {
    doSomething($data);
    return makeResponse(200);
} else {
    return makeResponse(422);
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, your unit is a single <code>if</code> statement, and all actions -- condition, <code>then</code> branch, <code>else</code> branch -- everything is passed as parameter. There is literally nothing to test.</p>

<p>Still, in attempt to test that <code>if</code> statement, you need to execute it somehow, and thus you need to prepare all these mocks etc. to just make that <code>if</code> work.</p>

<p>Basically, I'm in the same boat as you because the level of abstraction you have demonstrated is what I usually do. It always ends badly...</p>

<p>I have no "cure" for this ATM, but I think starting with famous <a href="https://medium.com/javascript-scene/mocking-is-a-code-smell-944a70c90a6a" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Mocking is a Code Smell</a> would be nice.</p>

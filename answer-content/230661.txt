<p>Just off the cuff, before I fully code review this, I would tell you:</p>

<p>1) There are not enough comments. You add comments like this:</p>

<pre><code>//string vals;
cout&lt;&lt;"Enter max_step_number for the random planner: ";
</code></pre>

<p>...these are obviously string vals, but what are these?</p>

<pre><code>motion_planner mp;
int x,y,gx,gy,r,c;
int val;
</code></pre>

<p>2) You need to initialize your values.</p>

<p>3) You need to have variable names that describe the function/purpose of the variable, i and j are fine for indexers, but outside of that one letter var names are a no-no.</p>

<p>4) You are not checking the input of your std::cin and expecting the values to be convertible.</p>

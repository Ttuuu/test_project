<p>Can't say much on Elixir, but, <code>make_key</code> - why go through the trouble and use MD5 on a string format of the current time (at what resolution? seconds? so you'll get duplicates whenever this is called quickly enough in rapid succession) when you can just generate a bunch of random numbers of a fixed length instead?  Additionally you might just be able to pass in the source of the random numbers too and then suddenly it's way more testable (because 1. you're not relying on the current time, 2. you're not on a global random number generator).</p>

<p>Your <code>getCount()</code> method is a little difficult to read, on one long line like that, and <em>way</em> too complicated. <code>s.count(_ == 'a')</code> is both concise and efficient.</p>

<p>It's not clear why the number of <code>s</code> repetitions possible in <code>n</code> is called <code>duplicate</code>. It seems an odd choice for that variable name.</p>

<p>Your algorithm is sound, I just find it excessively verbose, especially for a language that prides itself on being both expressive and concise.</p>

<pre><code>val sLen = s.length
s.count(_ == 'a') * (n/sLen) + s.take((n%sLen).toInt).count(_ == 'a')
</code></pre>

<p>Since you aren't using any of the things that make numpy fast, this code would be about 2x faster if you just used python lists instead. Alternatively, if you vectorized the update function, you would probably be able to make it much faster. That said, this will not be easy. <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/160802/game-of-life-with-numpy">This question</a> has a very good example of what the result would look like.</p>

<h1>Prefetch version does nothing with optimizer turned on.</h1>

<p>Since you are not using m1 and m2, compiler will eliminate them. You get identical codegen see <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/wahP5j" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a></p>

<h1>Branchs</h1>

<p>Rearranging the conditions appear to speed up the code by 20%, making basic case almost the same as duo version. Note the conditions are already swapped for duo version, this may explain some of its performance. It appears the less than branch is more common and allow other condition to be skipped.</p>

<pre><code>if (arr[m] &lt; search) l = m + 1;
else if (arr[m] == search) return m;
else r = m - 1;

<p>It is fine to create <code>Builder</code> without passing mandatory parameters in it's constructor. There can be cases, where you don't know all parameters at creation of builder, but you know them later before calling <code>.build()</code>.</p>

<p>What I am really missing here is <strong>validation</strong>, that object will be in correct state at the beginning of <code>build</code> method. That method should imho always either create <strong>valid object</strong> or <strong>throw exception</strong>. You can also choose what kind of instance type to return afterwards  as suggested by @JAD. But you seriously don't wanna deal with invalid or null objects returned by your builder.</p>

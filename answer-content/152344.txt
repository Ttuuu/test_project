<p>Each <code>MAP["resolved"]</code> has to perform a <code>hash</code> on <code>"resolved"</code>, and then check up the value in the dictionary's internal structure.
This is more costly then looking up a single variable.</p>

<p>Just like in the first, you can assign a local variable, <code>resolved</code>, but you can assign to the dictionary at the same time:</p>

<pre><code>resolved = MAP["resolved"] = []
</code></pre>

<p>If you only mutate <code>resolved</code>, then you mutate <code>MAP["resolved"]</code> too. So you can't overwrite <code>resolved</code> with <code>resolved = ['new list']</code>, for example.
Which can get you:</p>

<pre><code>MAP["resolved"] = resolved = []
MAP["rejected"] = rejected = []
for file in files_within("./_input/"):
    file = File(file)
    if file.extension.lower() == "gdb":
        resolved.append(file)
    else:
        rejected.append(file)
</code></pre>

<p>I am also unsure on what your functions are, I don't remember them being in the standard library, and so I won't suggest any changes to them.</p>

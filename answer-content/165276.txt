<p>With your JavaScript version, there is not much to optimize. So I am just going to provide some minor improvements:</p>

<ol>
<li>Within a function, it is better to declare your variables using the <code>var</code> keyword. You should apply this to the <code>i</code> inside <code>for()</code> loop</li>
<li>The JavaScript interpreter is a single thread: this means, unfortunately, you can not perform real parallelism to sum different chunks of the array.</li>
<li>You can choose better variables and function names.</li>
</ol>

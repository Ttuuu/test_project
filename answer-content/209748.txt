<p>It looks fine to me, I just a few minor suggestions.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>catch (Exception ex)
{
    throw ex;
}
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>You probably left this in by accident, but you're better off without a catch block if all you're going to do is re-throw.  And if you are going to keep this block, <code>throw;</code> is always preferable to <code>throw ex;</code></p>

<p>I question the wisdom of having a "default" key specified in the code.  It seems to me that it should always read from outside and complain loudly if it fails.  With a usable default key, it opens the possibility that it could use the wrong key without you knowing about it.</p>

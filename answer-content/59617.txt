<p>At the risk of (further) angering the moderators, I'll advise against following any advice about numerics that originates from any of the <em>Numeric Recipes</em> books<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p>While Horner's method can help in some cases, it's a long ways from a panacea. Rather than fixing the problem of roundoff when summing values, it attempts to avoid that problem. Unfortunately, it's only partially successful in doing so. For most polynomials there will still be inputs for which the results are relatively poor, even at best. </p>

<p>If the values produced by the terms of the polynomial may lead to numeric instability when summing, you might consider generating each individually, then using something like <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/q/56532/489">Kahan summation</a> to sum those terms. If you care, this can also give you an error margin along with the sum itself.</p>

<p>Probably better still is to use the Langlois, et al <a href="http://drops.dagstuhl.de/volltexte/2006/442/pdf/05391.LangloisPhilippe.Paper.442.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">compensated Horner's scheme</a>. At least the last time I looked carefully, this seemed to be pretty much the state of the art in evaluating polynomials. It maintains roughly the same accuracy of result as you'd get from using Horner's scheme using floating point numbers with double the precision (e.g., using a 64-bit double, it gives roughly the same accuracy as Horner's scheme with 128-bit quad-precision floating point, but without nearly the speed penalty that would normally carry). Like Kahan summation, this supports computation of an error bound on the result.</p>

I think a more accurate summary than "wonderful" is: "I've found that <em>Numerical Recipes</em> provide just enough information for a person to get himself into trouble, because after reading NR, one thinks that one understands what's going on."

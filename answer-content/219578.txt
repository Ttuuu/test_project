<p>The small amount of data doesn't merit the use of arrays. I agree with R. Roe comment on combining the Ranges.</p>

<p>But first:</p>

<ul>
<li>V is a very unhelpful helper variable, I would get rid of it. </li>
<li>Personally, I use <code>r</code> to iterate rows row, <code>c</code> to iterate columns and <code>cell</code> to iterate cells in a Range</li>
<li>Techiniquelly, the two if statements are more efficient than combining a single If statement.  Realistically, it will not make a noticeable difference with your code.   I would combine the Ifs and save the clutter.  </li>
</ul>

<p>You could calculate the upper bound based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Prime Number Theory</a>. Once you have this number you can implement the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Sieve of Eratosthenes</a>. One possible implementation is using a HashTable with every number from 2 to your upperbound as the key and a bool indicating prime status for the value. Iterate through the sieve marking each number. As you find a new prime increment a counter and when the counter matches n return that prime.</p>

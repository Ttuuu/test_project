<p>the <code>while</code> inside <code>dice_roll()</code> will roll the dice as long as you want to play again. I made your inicial input part of <code>main()</code>, so if you want to use this program from another one, it doesn't do anything, but you still get to use the <code>dice_roll()</code> function.</p>

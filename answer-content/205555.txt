<li><p>Do not do <code>using namespace std;</code> This is a bad habbit that pollutes your namespace needlessly. You are only using <code>std</code> in exaclty 4 places. Its really easy to be better here.</p></li>
<li><p>Please use sensible names. Your <code>t</code> is the number of test runs, so name it <code>numTests</code> or something similar. In a month you will never know the meaning of a given variable.</p></li>
<li><p>Stay consistent in your code style. You have different styles of for loop. This is really confusing and quite frankly annoying to read.</p></li>
<li><p>The question is marked as c++ but you use plain old C here. Rather than a C-style array you should use a <code>std::vector&lt;int&gt;</code></p></li>
<li><p>You are getting timeouts because you use a brute force approach. You should realize, that you can directly calulate the number of infomred people directly. At the first day it is <code>a[0]</code>. At the second day it is <code>a[0] + a[0] + ... a[a[0]]</code>. Consequently you can determine the number of newly informed people for every day just once and reuse that value.</p></li>

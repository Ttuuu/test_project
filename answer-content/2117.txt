<p>All in all, you're looking good!</p>

<p>Here are a few things that stand out to me:</p>

<ul>
<li>You're using double-underscore name
mangling, when you probably don't
need to. It's not the best habit to
get into. Single-underscore says "I
am private" without doing the
horrendous name obfuscation. Consider
renaming your <code>__method()</code> to
<code>_method()</code>.</li>
<li>Inside of <code>__getResult()</code> you're
defining <code>__d</code>. That means every time
that method is called, that
dictionary is recreated. This
probably isn't what you want. 
Consider moving it to a class
attribute</li>
<li>Your method (and some variable) names are <code>mixedCase</code>,
which breaks Python convention in
accordance with the <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">Python Style
Guide</a> (aka PEP 8). Consider
changing them to
<code>lower_case_with_underscores</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think you can get average-case O(n) complexity using hashing. </p>

<p>Perform a single pass over the data, recording consecutive ranges in a hash table ( the current start and end of each range needs to be recorded ).</p>

<p>When the next input element ( integer ) is encountered, check ( using hashing ) whether there is a range which can be extended.</p>

<p>If there is, extend that range, re-hashing as necessary. Keep track of the longest range found ( which will be the final result ).</p>

<p>[ Be sure to allow for the case where the new element allows two ranges to be merged ]</p>

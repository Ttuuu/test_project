  <p>I am thinking of removing timeoutStyle and timeout from the Cache constructor and providing default values that can be changed via public properties. How do you like that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does it make sense to change these properties in the middle of using the cache? Is it a desirable feature? If yes, go ahead. If not, and you just want to provide default values to make it easier to construct the class, then add a default constructor that calls the existing one.</p>

<p>I don't know enough C# to comment on the rest, I hope you'll get good reviews!</p>

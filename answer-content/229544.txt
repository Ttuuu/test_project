<ul>
<li><p><code>add_member_to</code> acts on <code>family_tree</code> and changes its fields. It is more logical to define the method in the class <code>Family</code> as <code>add_member</code> instead.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>Family</code> class should directly store a list of <code>Person</code>s as a field rather than copying all the information of the family members. Information of members can be directly retrieved from <code>Person</code> objects when needed. This avoids the same data being copied redundantly, which adds burden to maintainence (e.g., every change of <code>Person</code> information requires a subsequent change in <code>Family</code> of the copied information). <code>names</code>, <code>birthplaces</code>, <code>dobs</code>, <code>deaths</code> can be defined as class properties and accessed through defined methods.</p></li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><code>Person</code> can be defined as a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">dataclass</a>, which can automatically generate methods such as <code>__init__</code> from field definitions. It may be an overkill for this small program but it will be useful for larger classes.</li>

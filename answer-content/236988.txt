<p>Mathematically, that is not correct. The determinant of an empty (i.e. zero-dimensional) matrix is <em>one,</em> see for example <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/q/1762537/42969">What is the determinant of []?</a> on Mathematics Stack Exchange.</p>

<hr>

<p>With respect to <em>efficiency:</em> Your program computes the determinant recursively using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant#Laplace's_formula_and_the_adjugate_matrix" rel="noreferrer">Laplace formula</a>, which requires <span class="math-container">\$ O(n!) \$</span> arithmetic operations, and the creation of many temporary “submatrices”.</p>

<p>A better method (at least for larger matrices) is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination#Computing_determinants" rel="noreferrer">Gaussian elimination</a> which requires <span class="math-container">\$ O(n^3) \$</span> arithmetic operations, and can operate on a single copy of the original matrix.</p>

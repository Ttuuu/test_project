<p>A good start.<br>
<strong>But</strong> you need to templatize your functions and the <code>type_map</code> by the enum to make the design extensible.  That is a simple change so I will not focus on that.</p>

<p>About the only other thing is that you search when doing a conversion in either direction. By choosing the appropriate container to hold the information you can do a quick lookup in one direction (though not in both without some fancier than normal containers).</p>

<p>Otherwise I quite like it.</p>

<p>It's not the style I would have chosen - see <a href="/a/14315">my alternative answer</a>.</p>

<p>Seeing as <code>Issues</code> is a fixed size array, personally I'd be looking into caching the results (unless <code>Issues</code> or things within the <code>Issues</code> will be changing more than the properties are being called). </p>

<p>Though if your class is being populated with de-serialisation and it's not supposed to be changed (as I'd assume it is given the class' name), I'd be tempted to make it publicly immutable by setting all the setters to private/protected. This would have the additional benefit of meaning you could evaluate the properties at the point of de-serialisation and not have to query the arrays from within properties at all.</p>

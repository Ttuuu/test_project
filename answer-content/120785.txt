<p>I usually manage most of the situation using built-in formulas. This keeps the user engaging. Only when there is an event driven requirement, I create a module / class to accomplish the tasks. </p>

<p>I am not sure why you have opted for a Class Module design. </p>

<p>However, the following are my recommendations, though not fully complete:</p>

<ol>
<li>Set the property Application.ScreenUpdating to False. This will avoid refreshing your screen and process your code faster</li>
<li>For sorting, you could use the Range.Sort function to accomplish the task</li>
<li>To improve the looping structure, follow these principles</li>
</ol>

<p>Bad:</p>

<pre><code>     For i = 1 to Range("aircraft").count
         ....
     Next i
</code></pre>

<p>Good:</p>

<pre><code>     TotalAircrafts = Range ("Aircraft").Count
     For AircraftCnt = 1 to TotalAircrafts
      .....
     Next AircraftCnt
</code></pre>

<p>Apart, if you share the workbook, I could run through and see if I could move the stone further. </p>

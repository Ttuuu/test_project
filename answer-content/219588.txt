<p>At the very least use a try-with-resources: </p>

<pre><code>while (true) {
    try(BufferedReader inFromClient = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(connectionSocket.getInputStream())),
            DataOutputStream outToClient = new DataOutputStream(connectionSocket.getOutputStream())){
        //... Do read/write stuff
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then when the loop body is done (by normal control flow or by exception) the streams will be closed normally.</p>

<p>However if you want a lot of clients connecting at a time and you want them all to be able to interact at the same time you will need to delve into the async IO in the java.nio.channels package.</p>

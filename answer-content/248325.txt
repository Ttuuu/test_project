<p><strong>After looking at it a bit</strong></p>
<p>hashedIndex does many things. It salts the input, hashes it, wraps it and makes sure it fits into the size. Could it be split up and more clear what is happening?</p>
<p>The confusion matrix seems like a general mathy thing, why does it have a direct dependency on a BloomFilter and its data? Try to come up with some way of decoupling these so the confusion matrix can be reused for other statistical purposes.</p>
<p>countTruePositiveAndFalseNegative and countFalsePositiveAndTrueNegative looks a lot like repetition, can the logic be moved to a single implementation?</p>
<p>None of the classes implement interfaces or abstract methods, so using them would require a dependency to the concrete implementation, making the depende unnecessarily difficult to test and change.</p>
<p>There is a possible divide by zero issue if inFilterCount or notInFilterCount is zero.</p>

<p>You have 9 copy pasted buttons with identical behaviour, just a different label. Turn those into a reusable class that take the label and action listener as parameters. Instead of hard coding the phrase buttons into instance fields, define the phrases as array of strings and create the buttons from the array. You'll be able to introduce phrases like "I know you post to CodeReview" later. Stuff the JButtons into a list if you need to refer to them later (you probably don't need to).</p>

<p>You've put all your code into the GUI classes. Refactor the counter into a separate model class to adhere to the single responsibility principle. It'll also move your code closer to the MVC model.</p>

<p>The action listener should be it's own class. The UI classes should just be about setting up the components.</p>

<p>What the heck does your loading screen do? Loading screens are evil. Apps should start instantly. Kill it with fire and never do it again. :)</p>

<p>@TorbenPutkonen's <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/244921/203649">answer</a> includes all the important facts about your code, I want just to add some minor thoughts. When you works with java threads and you have some shared variables check if there is a thread safe alternative already implemented in the java library. So instead of <code>long</code> and <code>boolean</code> use the thread safe alternatives <code>AtomicLong</code> and <code>AtomicBoolean</code>, same approach for the list that must be synchronized.</p>

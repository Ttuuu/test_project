<p>Seems complicated with all the libraries requirements for this simple problem. I'm not proficient in Python syntax but I know this can be done. Let me explain in pseudocode (syntax can be looked up by you):</p>

<ol>
<li>Declare a list (or array as I call it in other langs) of <code>alphabet[]="'a', 'b',....'z'"</code>
Their index position is ALREADY their positions...so, the position of 'a' is 0 (because Python index is 0-based; if you don't like it, you can just add 1 to the result to show results  counting from 1)
(lowercase or uppercase, doesn't matter since you're looking at the position of them in either case not their <code>ord</code> values)</li>
<li>Get the string to compare and its length: <code>len(astring)</code>
For that length, iterate and find the character (<code>achar</code> for example) in the string (<code>astring</code> for example). Either <code>for</code> loop or some magical python 1-line statements like: <code>for achar in astring</code>
If you use a 1-line statement instead of a loop, you'd probably have to load them into another list and loop in that. Not sure, I like <code>for</code> loops, so...
Inside the <code>for</code> loop, check each <code>achar</code>'s index location if <code>chr(x) == astring[i]</code> for example where <code>i</code> is loop counter, then load that location into a new array (define an empty array outside of the loop first) say, "<code>positions[]</code>"</li>
<li>After the loop ends, <code>positions[]</code> should have the positions (0-based) of each matching char. You could add 1 to each value if you want the positions to be 1-based.</li>
</ol>

<p>Sorry, I couldn't write the whole code mainly because my syntax knowledge isn't very good in Python yet, but the logic should make sense, right?</p>

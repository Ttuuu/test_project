<p>The algorithm does not allow for the possibility of a transition from daylight time to standard time or vice versa.</p>

<p>Without knowing the mechanism for obtaining the date and time, it's impossible to say if the algorithm needs to be aware of time zones. In principle, the student could be attending by video conference and be in a different time zone.</p>

<p>If the time and date is obtained from a device belonging to the student, the student may prefer to operate the device on a time zone different from the school. For example, both the student and the school could be located in New York but the student corresponds with people all over the world, so keeps her laptop set to UTC.</p>

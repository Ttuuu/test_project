<p>You can predefine some of the conditions.  E.g.</p>

<pre><code>let blocked = (board[position.y - 1][position.x] !== "vacant")
let unmoved = (y === 6)
â€¦
</code></pre>

<p>You can also define some short functions.  E.g. <code>isEnemy(x,y)</code> would return true if there is an enemy piece at that position.</p>

<p>Then using those variables in the tests will make them look tidier, and be easier to read and understand.</p>

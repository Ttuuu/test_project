<p>A little addition to Jens Schauder's answer:</p>

<p>You shouldn't abbreviate a field name, especially if the field name is a key to a table whose name isn't abbreviated.</p>

<p><code>DeptId</code> primary key and foreign keys should be renamed to <code>DepartmentId</code>.</p>

<p>This assures consistency and helps avoid problems if using some ORMs.</p>

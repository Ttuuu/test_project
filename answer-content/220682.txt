<p>Unfortunately nobody has reviewed this code since it was posted. Are you still using this code? It doesn't appear that you have been active much here in recent years so I might guess not. </p>

<p>The functions <code>ailogic.imaginaryMoveThem()</code> and <code>ailogic.imaginaryMoveMe()</code> look very redundant. Perhaps it would be simpler to abstract out the common code to a separate function that accepts parameters like the <code>bestMoveValue</code> and the player (e.g. <code>this.me</code> or <code>this.them</code>).</p>

<p>Perhaps it would be wise to pull out the array used in <code>formatMoveData()</code> to a constant (e.g. using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>const</code></a> keyword). That way the function can be much shorter, and that array could be used elsewhere if needed.</p>

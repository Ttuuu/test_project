<p>I suggest to exctract the ActionListener into separate classes and bind them to the Buttons :</p>

<pre><code>button.addActionListener(new AdditionButtonListener())

public class AdditionActionListener implenents ActionListener{} 
</code></pre>

<p>I also suggest to separate your view from your Model. Invent A separate Calculator that consists the actual state of your Calculator and use the ActionListeners registered on your GUI buttons to manipulate your calculator state. </p>

<p>In general I would recommend to read about common design patterns so you get A feeling for seperating things and building some kind of logical flow in your application. </p>

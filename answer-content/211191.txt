<p>There are a few optimizations that can be made to the code to speed it up, mainly to do with how some mathematical operations are performed in VBA. Not sure if I have it implemented 100% accurately so please review for accuracy. Also, I'm sure there are more optimizations to be had, but this is hopefully a starting point for further conversation. </p>

<p>A lot of my changes may be PC specific. It may ultimately depend on your CPU and instruction set available. On my computer, this runs in about 2.5 seconds.</p>

<p>A list of changes:</p>

<ol>
<li>I replaced all instances of raising something to a power of two, instead, I just multiplied the item by itself.</li>
<li>I pre-computed this part <code>Sqr((2 * Exp(-1)))</code> as it appears to always be the same, so it isn't calculated for each loop and put it into a constant.</li>
<li>I removed the variable <code>v2</code>, it wasn't really needed, you just needed to introduce <code>Rnd</code> in one more spot</li>
<li>General cleanup of the code, and renamed a few variables for clarity</li>
</ol>

<p>It is often not very useful to have such a mix. It could make sense if you really wanted it to be associative array, but it just so happens that you can have the key strings contain numbers and even consecutive numers starting at zero which make it look like vector because php converts integer string keys to ints.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>$robotsByName = [
  "0" =&gt; ["id" =&gt; 0, "name" =&gt; "0"],
  "1" =&gt; ["id" =&gt; 1, "name" =&gt; "1"],
  "2" =&gt; ["id" =&gt; 2, "name" =&gt; "2"],
  "johnny5" =&gt; ["id" =&gt; 3, "name" =&gt; "johnny5"],
];
</code></pre>

<p>If you have to deal with the input structure as is because it is not under your control, you could simplify your conversion like this:</p>

<pre><code>$myFruit = [
  'Fruitbowl' =&gt; \array_slice($myFruit, 0, \count($myFruit)-1),
  'Other_Fruit' =&gt; $myFruit['Other_Fruit'],
];
</code></pre>
    </div>

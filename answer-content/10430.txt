<p>This depends on what you want to do in case of an exception. If your handling is just printing the stack trace your solution is OK. But you might want to react in a different way depending on the problem.</p>

<p>Just an example:</p>

<ul>
<li>an IO problem could mean that you have to retry (in case on network)</li>
<li>a malformed URL might mean that you have to generate an error message and ask the user to re-enter the data</li>
<li>and so on</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not try to recover from the error, I don't know if it makes sense to catch the exception, print the stack trace and then continue. It might be the same as letting the application crash (and print the exception anyway).</p>

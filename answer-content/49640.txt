<p>A good general rule is that if the code takes more than two screens of text, it should be split into functions.  Sure you can read your spaghetti code, but always remember that you're coding for other people to read it.  These people may be your teacher (at school), your co-workers (when you leave school), or you in 6 months time (when you look at it and go "WTF?!").</p>

<p>The big thing with functions though is that you may have more than one way of getting somewhere.  If you're on a flat featureless plain and you go north then west, you'd usually expect to get to same place as if you go west then north.  Your code simply doesn't allow this to happen though.  Do you want to copy-and-paste code to do the same thing twice?  (If your answer is anything other than variations on the theme of "hell no!" then you've just failed your programming aptitude test. ;)  Functions will let you do this very easily, so use them.</p>

<p>One thing in your code that you want to fix is re-entrant function calls.  What I mean by this is that you're calling <code>road()</code> from within <code>road()</code>.  This is almost always a bad thing to do.  If there are any changes to global resources during the function (hint: <code>cls()</code> changes the state of a global resource...) then your re-entry may do things you didn't want it to.  You'd need to keep track of how each re-entry affects the ones before it, which gets epicly complex very quickly.  Worse, each time you re-enter, you use up a new chunk of stack space.  On really small systems (like Arduino) you can easily use up more memory than the system has free, and it all crashes.  Even on big systems like PCs, if you accidentally set up something which re-enters in a loop and keeps going for a while then you can kill things that way too.  You <em>really</em> need to fix this, because it's very bad practice.</p>

<p>Oh, and have a play of some of the classic 80's text adventure games. "Planetfall" or the "Zork" series are top tips.</p>

<p>What jumps out at me is the nested for loop in checkForWinner.  If I were to try this I'd think more in terms of a different condition for how a winning combo is determined.  We know in this board there are only 3 spots.</p>

<p>It also doesn't seem to make sense to check for winner at the end of each move.  I think I'd just do some kind of recursive check on the neighbors of a given space to see if any are == .  </p>

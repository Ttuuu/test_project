<p>In terms of making more robust, a fairly obvious improvement would be to ensure that <code>argv[1]</code> exists before using it (that's what <code>argc</code> is for).  If there's no argument, or the file can't be read, emit a useful error message to <code>std::cerr</code> and return <code>EXIT_FAILURE</code> - negative return values from <code>main()</code> can vary by platform.</p>

<p>Why do we declare <code>CannyThreshold</code> with two arguments, but never use them?  Just declare it taking no arguments.</p>

<p>Your description mentions saving the result, but I don't see any code for that - did you perhaps show us the wrong version of the program?</p>

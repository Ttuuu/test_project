<p>Your <code>Workstation</code> objects are calling <code>time.sleep(.1)</code> when any object is being processed.  This will delay the main loop.  If more than one <code>Workstation</code> is active, the game will slow down twice as much.</p>

<p>If you want to sleep for 0.1 seconds, it should be done <strong>only</strong> by the main loop itself, after updating all of the items.  It should never be done by the objects in the simulation.</p>

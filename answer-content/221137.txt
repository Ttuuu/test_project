<p>I've read over a couple of your past questions, and I can't really describe how unsightly the code is without violating SE's rules.</p>

<p>Read and follow <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP8</a>.</p>

<p>Skip over the section "A Foolish Consistency is the Hobgoblin of Little Minds" as you don't seem to know what good code looks like and you arn't interacting with legacy code. It's better to be a Hobgoblin for now, as you'll produce better code than you are now.</p>

<hr>

<p>Get a couple of linter wrappers, like <a href="https://pypi.org/project/flake8/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Flake8</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/prospector/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Prospector</a> or <a href="https://pypi.org/project/coala-bears/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Coala</a>. Make sure to turn all warnings on, as they don't normally by default.</p>

<p>These will help you know what parts of your code sucks without having to ask others!</p>

<p>Fixing all the errors these tools raise helps keep your code clean and make it so when you produce larger programs it's easier to understand what your code is doing. You may protest and say, "but people on Code Review understand my code!"
And you would be right, but that is because you're developing solutions to coding challenges, not real life problems that are more intricate and require larger amounts of code.</p>

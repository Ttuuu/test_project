<p>It isn't necessary to completely sort the collection to compute the median.</p>

<p>We can get away with merely partitioning the data, using <code>std::partition()</code>.  Then take the highest value from the first half; for even-length data, average that with the lowest value from the second half.</p>

<p>The algorithmic complexity is then still O(<em>n</em> log <em>n</em>), but with a greatly reduced constant factor.</p>

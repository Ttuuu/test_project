<p>I was going in circles looking at your query and then I thought
... it looks like you're just updating the one table form the same table</p>

<p>Why can't you just use</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE hashes 
SET id=@id
    WHERE hash IN ('hash1', 'hash2');
</code></pre>

<pre><code>UPDATE hashes 
</code></pre>
    </div>

<p>In the recursive version of the code you don't need the function prototype <code>unsigned long long fibonacci(unsigned long long n);</code>.</p>

<p>As you mentioned you shouldn't have the <code>using namespace std;</code> statement in the code.</p>

<p>We can't answer </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why do most people (on the internet) recommend using recursion because it's simpler and easier to write the program?(well logically I thought that we should write it in a way that is fast and simple)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because it is an opinion.</p>

<p>In the iterative version you should also have the <code>fibonacci(unsigned long long n)</code> function to make <code>main()</code> simpler.</p>

<h2>Your Concerns</h2>
<p>The use of <code>pow(i, 2)</code> is unnecessary; you should simply use <code>i*i</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>goto</code> statement is also unnecessary.  You could wrap the code in <code>while(true) { ... }</code>.</p>
<h2>Other Concerns</h2>
<p>The cast <code>(int) i</code> is also unnecessary, as <code>i</code> is already an integer.  Perhaps you meant to cast to a double?</p>
<p>Computing <code>sqrt(n)</code> in the <code>for</code> loop termination condition is inefficient; you should compute it once outside the loop.</p>
<p>The <code>primes</code> global should probably be declared static, so it isn’t visible outside the module.  Then the “helper” function <code>sieve_of_eratosthenes</code> should also be static.</p>
<p>Your overflow and resizing of the sieve does not preserve any previous work; perhaps you could use <code>realloc</code>?</p>
<p>No twin prime pair would ever be even, so you could optimize the sieve to skip even numbers.</p>
<p>This statement <code>memset(primes.array, true, n * sizeof(bool));</code> is questionable.  If a bool is larger than 1 byte, then what are you storing in the array?  For instance, if each <code>sizeof(bool) == 2</code>, then <code>primes.array[0]</code> would be <code>0x0101</code>, which is not the same as <code>true</code>.</p>

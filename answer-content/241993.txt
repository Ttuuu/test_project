<p>When designing a class never ignore what you're making the construction and using code look like.</p>

<pre><code>User user = new User(
    123,
    new FullName("Homer", "Jay", "Simpson"),
    new Email("chunkylover53@aol.com"),
    new Address("742", "Evergreen Terrace", "??", "?????"),
    new Contacts(124, 125, 126, 127)
);

user.sendBill(overdueNotice);
user.sendEmail(promotion42);
</code></pre>

<p>This uses composition, not inheritance, which, without a good reason otherwise, is generally preferred.</p>

<p>Done this way the class can be fully immutable since no setters have been used. This means it can be shared across threads without fear of using it while it's partially updated. </p>

<p>Breaking the class into smaller classes avoids long lists of unreadable constructor parameters.</p>

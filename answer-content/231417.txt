<h2>Use Intention-Revealing Names</h2>
<p>Based on naming alone, the intent of the <code>Calc()</code> method is not clear. As the reader of your code, I have to look at the implementation details of this method to understand what we are calculating.</p>
<h2>Method Characteristics</h2>
<p>Pay careful attention to your method signatures.</p>
<p>Do <code>ExitProgram()</code> and <code>Calc()</code> need to both be static? If <code>Calc()</code> no longer used the console to display I/O information and had a dependency on something else used for display, unit testing becomes much more difficult due to it being a static method.</p>
<p>Should <code>ExitProgram()</code> be public? If this was used in a larger application, would you want others to call this method? It seems like the answer is no, as the UI output of this method is coupled with information about the calculations.</p>
<h2>Control Flow and Validation</h2>
<p>Ideally, main should delegate all processing elsewhere. In the <code>Calc()</code> method, we should be performing validation on user input. If I enter an invalid operation, I get the message "Error! Try again." without knowing exactly what I did wrong. I am also forced to re-enter all inputs if I want to try again. This may be an opportunity to practice throwing and catching exceptions for cleaner code and a better user experience.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I like the way you have started to separate your methods into ways that make sense. I also appreciate the line breaks within your methods to further separate things into logical groupings. I will leave a link to my live code review below and I hope this feedback helps!</p>

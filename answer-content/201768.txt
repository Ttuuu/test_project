<p>Just to add to the answers already here, four things jump out at me. The datetime calculations, the print statements, the import statement and the case used in variables.   </p>

<p><strong>Case</strong>: Python uses snake_case and not camelCase. Please look into formatting your code in a PEP8 way.</p>

<p><strong>import statement</strong>: Your code only imports <code>datetime</code> and later, when you use it, you write <code>datetime.datetime.now()</code>. Here's a coding tip you might not have thought of previously - if you need to use more than a single period in your <code>objects.attributes</code> or <code>objects.methods()</code>, then you're probably importing too much/too high a level.<br>
Of course, my example violates that as I request the attribute after the method call - (¬‿¬) but the point remains true for imports.</p>

<p><strong>Datetime</strong>: Your code converts the datetime into a string, slices it, converts it to an integer. This is unnecessary. If you're going to perform calculations, leave everything as integers/floats.</p>

<p><strong>Strings</strong>: Please look into the format function or if you use Python 3.6 or newer, f-strings. I'll put both in the example below including executing a function inside an f-string (so, 3 print statements). </p>

<pre><code>from datetime import datetime


def get_user_input():
    name = input("Please tell me your name: ")
    age = int(input("How old are you?"))
    return name, age


def what_year_when_100(age):
    return 100 - age + datetime.now().year


if __name__ == "__main__":
    user_name, user_age = get_user_input()
    print(f"{user_name} is going to be 100 by {what_year_when_100(user_age)}") # Python 3.6+
    when_100 = what_year_when_100(user_age)
    print("{} is going to be 100 by {}".format(user_name, when_100)) #Python 2/3
    print(f"{user_name} is going to be 100 by {when_100}") # Python 3.6+
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

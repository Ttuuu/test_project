<p>Depending on how large your lower and upper limits are, it may be faster to just generate all primes using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Sieve of Eratosthenes</a> implementation.</p>
<p>If the limits are beyond what is reasonable to generate all primes for, then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primality_test" rel="nofollow noreferrer">primality testing</a> such as Miller-Rabin is significantly faster than trial division. For example, <code>gmpy2.is_prime</code>.</p>

<p>The biggest problem I see is that the objects you pass around in EJB3 are part of the transaction. If you try to reload the payment again from the EntityManager, you will get back the exact same instance you are trying to avoid changing. You will have to jump through hoops in order to reload the payment as a completely new object and that pretty much negates anything that makes pure methods less error prone.</p>

<p>Following best practises is a valid reason but in this case I get the feeling that the baby gets thrown out with the bath water. Don't feel bad, though. EJB3 transaction model is not intuitive at all, needs very good project documentation and guidelines and it still needs constant care taking anyway.</p>

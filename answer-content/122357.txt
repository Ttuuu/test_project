<p><strong>Code</strong></p>

<p>First of all, please avoid having a <code>static int temp</code>: in case two or more threads call your insertion sort, they will interfere. Also, I would declare the constructor as <strong><code>private</code></strong>:</p>

<pre><code>private InsertionSortNew() {}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Style</strong></p>

<p>You abuse your code with empty lines. Usually people put empty lines before and after conditional blocks (<strong><code>if</code></strong>) and loops (<strong><code>for</code></strong>, <strong><code>while</code></strong>).</p>

<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>

<p>You can prune away like 60% of assignments in the inner loop as follows: first, you store the element being inserted; next, until sorted you keep moving the preceding larger integers one position to the right, and finally, you put the cached element into its correct position.</p>

<p>All in all, I had this in mind:</p>

<pre><code>private InsertionSortNew() {}

public static final void sort(int [] array){
    for (int i = 1; i &lt; array.length; ++i) {
        int key = array[i];
        int j;

        for (j = i - 1; j &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; array[j] &gt; key; --j) {
            array[j + 1] = array[j];
        }

        array[j + 1] = key; 
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>..., which gives me these performance figures:</p>

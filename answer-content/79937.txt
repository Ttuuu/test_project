<p>To answer your question, no, your login system isn't secure.  chumkiu's answer just covers the obvious issues.  It'll take more effort than it is worth to actually secure it.  You are better off using a pre-built login system that has been hardened against multiple attack vectors.  Here are a couple to choose from:</p>

<p>Rolls-Royce:  <a href="http://barebonescms.com/documentation/sso/" rel="nofollow">http://barebonescms.com/documentation/sso/</a></p>

<p>Pinto:  <a href="http://www.php-login.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.php-login.net/</a></p>

<p>The former has everything you will ever need in a login system.  The latter is bizarrely split off into multiple projects, which makes maintenance for the project maintainers a lot harder, but their software at least aims to be secure and is backed with experience.</p>

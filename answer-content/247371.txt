<p>Initially I wrote an answer related to PHP part, suggesting the usage of dedicated functions for reading and writing csv, <code>fgetcsv()</code> and <code>fputcsv()</code> respectively, but I didn't test the code. Thanks to @akki who pointed out to some errors and the profiling results, I learned that these functions are <em>dramatically</em> slower, as explained in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/55688173/285587A">this answer</a>. It looks like fgetcsv() is 40 times slower than fread/explode. However, to parse the proper csv, with field delimiters and escaping, you have to use the proper function anyway.</p>
<p>Here is the code</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

$t = microtime(1);
$i_fp = fopen("inFile.csv","r");
while(!feof($i_fp)) {
    $line = fgets($i_fp);
    $split = explode(';',$line);
}
echo "fgets: ".round(microtime(1)-$t,2)."\n";    
$t = microtime(1);
$i_fp = fopen("inFile.csv","r");
while (($split = fgetcsv($i_fp, 512, ';')) !== FALSE)
{
}
echo "fgetcsv: ".round(microtime(1)-$t,2)."\n";    
</code></pre>
<p>outputs for me</p>
<pre><code>fgets: 2.1
fgetcsv: 84.45
</code></pre>
<p>on a file with 1 mil rows</p>

<p>I don't really see anything that jumps out as an obvious simplification. I looked online for other code for this task and only found one <a href="https://github.com/vineetjohn/daily-coding-problem/blob/master/solutions/problem_167.py" rel="nofollow noreferrer">in python</a> which uses the same basic algorithm. </p>

<p>The only suggestion I have is for readability, the name <code>match</code> in the functional solution might be slightly confusing for anyone reading the code. Perhaps a more appropriate name would be something like <code>subMatches</code>.</p>

<p>I did notice that the functional solution concatenates the strings with a template literal, while the imperative solution uses traditional string concatenation. Why not just use the traditional technique in the functional solution? The results of <a href="https://jsperf.com/template-literal-vs-string-plus/7" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this jsPerf</a> show negligible differences between the two approaches.</p>

<h2>Strongly-typed preference structures</h2>
<p>Avoid using a dictionary for <code>rama_preferences</code>. We aren't in JavaScript: Python has actual classes, and there are light-weight options such as <code>@dataclass</code>. That last option in particular supports good type hinting, which will lend your program better structure and testability.</p>
<p>The code directly after <code>Read in the expected torsion angles</code> can likely turn into a class method.</p>
<h2>Reserved names</h2>
<p>"Dunder" (double-underscore) names are reserved for special purposes and should not be used for general variables, so <code>__location__</code> needs to be renamed, probably just to <code>location</code>.</p>
<h2>Functions</h2>
<p>All of your code is in global scope. Consider moving it into functions for better testability and more meaningful stack traces.</p>
<h2>Shared axes</h2>
<p>Consider sharing your axis ticks, labels and title for both horizontal and vertical. Vertical (psi) will only have these on the extreme left, and horizontal (phi) will only have these on the extreme bottom.</p>
<p>Refer to <code>sharex, sharey : Axes, optional</code> or <code>get_shared_y_axes</code> in <a href="https://matplotlib.org/3.1.3/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.subplot.html#matplotlib.pyplot.subplot" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the documentation</a>.</p>

<p>There are 5 steps you could take after which you could repost your code here.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use 'Option Explicit' in each module and address the errors that this will show.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are able, install the RubberDuck addin.  Use the 'RubberDuck' addin to do a code inspection and then address all the issues you find.</p></li>
<li><p>Split your code into simple functions/subs.  At the moment your macro does a number of tasks.  You should aim to separate your code into a set of small and simple subs and functions.</p></li>
<li><p>Use RubberDuck to write some unit tests for your newly created subs and functions.  This will be extremely useful for the person who inherits your code.</p></li>
<li><p>Use meaningful names.  At the moment you have a tendency towards a naming convention called systems Hungarian (e.g. objWord). This style of naming is deprecated as such names are not useful because they say nothing about the purpose of the variable or function/sub.  Try using names that mean something in the context of the task in hand.  e.g. test_doc.</p></li>

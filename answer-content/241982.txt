<p>Remarks about <em>algorithm</em>:</p>

<p>I see <code>findParentDepth()</code> (my suggestion for "the look-for-single-value method") doing a full traversal. Input specification is <code>tree with unique values</code>:<br>
stop looking on first occurrence.</p>

<p>(If not a single value was found there is no cousin.)</p>

<p>With one value (say, <em>a</em>) found, one condition for <em>no cousins</em> would be the other child holding the other value <em>b</em>:
check the right child.</p>

<p>All that might still be needed is a <em>level search</em> for <em>b</em> at the level of <em>a</em>, possibly excluding the part of the tree already traversed.</p>

<h1>List Comprehension</h1>

<p>It doesn't look like you're new to list comprehension. So why do you use it some places but not others? When you get the Account Number/Title/Type from the json service file, you use standard loops. These loops can be reduced to three lines:</p>

<pre><code>json_accounts_list = [i['ACC#'] for i in json_file_account]
json_title_list = [i['TITLE'] for i in json_file_account]
json_type_list = [i['STYPE'] for i in json_file_account]
</code></pre>

<p>This reduction can also be applied to when you get all the data from the json service:</p>

<pre><code>xml_title_list = [j.text for j in root.findall("./FCDB_BODY/CUSTACCOUNT/ACCOUNT/ACCOUNTTITLE")]
xml_type_list = [k.text for k in root.findall("./FCDB_BODY/CUSTACCOUNT/ACCOUNT/ACCOUNTTYPEDETAIL")]
xml_desc_list = [l.text for l in root.findall("./FCDB_BODY/CUSTACCOUNT/ACCOUNT/ACCPRDDESC")]
</code></pre>

<h1>String Formatting</h1>

<p>This one is personal preference, but can provide some cleanliness to your code:</p>

<pre><code>('%f' % json_account_bal).rstrip('0').rstrip('.')
</code></pre>

<p>can be</p>

<pre><code>f"{json_account_bal}".rstrip('0').rstrip('.')
</code></pre>

<p>This removes the use of parentheses and looks just a bit neater. This can be applied to other parts of your program as well.</p>

<h1>Functions</h1>

<p>Your entire program is enveloped in a for loop. I would recommend splitting parts of your code into functions so you can separate and manage what parts do what.</p>

<h1>Printing</h1>

<p>Just a little aside about printing. When you print like <code>print("Hi ", name)</code>, there are two spaces between "Hi" and whatever the name is. The print function inserts a space whenever you're printing like this, so a little neater output would be <code>print("Hi", name)</code>.</p>

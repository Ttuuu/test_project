<h1>leave the original data intact</h1>

<p>Since <code>df</code> is the original data, adding columns to it can have a strange side effect in another part of the calculation. Best is not to touch the original data, and do all the calculations etc in separate series or copied DataFrames</p>

<h1>pd.grouper</h1>

<p>You can use <code>pd.Grouper</code> to group per day and hour</p>

<p>You can group the date per subject and hour with:</p>

<pre><code>df.groupby(["subject_id", pd.Grouper(key="time_1", freq="h"), "val"])
</code></pre>

<p>Then you don't need all those extra columns "hr", "date" and "day" anymore.
There is no reason for the column "t_d" either. since <code>timedelta</code>'s can be counted, summed etc as well.</p>

<h1>aggregation function</h1>

<p>Apart from that,  you can design a specific function to get the requested minimum from one such group.</p>

<p>If you supply it data grouped per subject and date, dropping rows with the same <code>val</code> and checking whether more than 1hr has passed is a lot easier</p>

<pre><code>def day_grouper(group):
    """
    Returns the minimum in `val` that lasted more than 1 hour
    """
    # drop consecutive same values.
    # The first value is retained because it becomes NaN and `NaN != 0`
    group = group.loc[group["val"].diff() != 0]
    # drop those that take less than 1hr
    more_than_1h = group["time_1"].diff().shift(-1) &gt; pd.Timedelta("1h")
    # Check whether the last value started before 23:00
    more_than_1h.iloc[-1] = group["time_1"].iloc[-1].time() &lt; datetime.time(23)
    return group.loc[more_than_1h, "val"].min()
</code></pre>

<p>This can then be called like this:</p>

<pre><code>(
    df.groupby(["subject_id", pd.Grouper(key="time_1", freq="d")])
    .apply(day_grouper)
    .rename("val")
    .reset_index()
)
</code></pre>

<p>The 2 last rows are to get the format you want</p>

<h1>code formatting</h1>

<p>Try to follow Pep-8.</p>

<p>Â£some of your lines are really long, and convention is a space after a comma.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/psf/black" rel="nofollow noreferrer">black</a> to format my source code, so I don't have to worry about long lines, spaces, etc any more</p>

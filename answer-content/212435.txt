<p>I think of OOP as being a method to promote reuse by decomposing large data sets into types which tell how to handle their own data, and which can inherit or be inherited to make more complex types without having to duplicate or rewrite the more basic methods of handling the smaller data structures.</p>

<p>That said, you don't really declare any classes or other structures in here, so there isn't a way to make this more "Object Oriented".</p>

<p>You can make it a bit more pythonic by following through on your impulse to have a main function:</p>

<pre><code>import os
import subprocess 

def main():
    cw = os.getcwd()
    path = '/scrape'
    ourPath = cw + os.path.join(path)

    if(ourPath):
        os.chdir(ourPath)
        os.system('scrapy crawl yellow')

if__name__== "__main__":
    main()
</code></pre>
    </div>

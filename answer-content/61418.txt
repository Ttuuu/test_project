<p>I like how you have declared the Fizz and Buzz 'constants'. It makes the code more readable.</p>

<p>The comments are useful too, though, for consistency, the second comment should be changed from:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>BTW Froot will run 1 through 100
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>BTW Froot runs 1 through 100
</code></pre>

<p>The idea of generating <code>Froot</code> from <code>Frootz</code> is also good, because it reduces the computations later in the code.</p>

<p>I only wish you used a better name than <code>Frootz</code> because it conflicts with <code>Froot</code>. The similarity is.... uncanny.</p>

<p>I would suggest the name <code>Loopz</code>:</p>

<pre><code>I HAS A Loopz ITZ SUM OF Frootz AN 1
</code></pre>

<p>This will reduce the ambiguity, and improve the readability and maintainability.</p>

<p>Finally, it is good that you put the <code>Fizz</code> modulo check before the <code>Buzz</code> check because that improves performance. Many people put buzz first, but that means the modulo-5 check happens, and that fails more often than the modulo-3 check, so people who do the Buzz-loop first tend to do about 20% more conditional checks.</p>

<p>All in all, for a first go, I am very impressed with your result. I can't wait until you implement a <a href="/questions/tagged/fim%2b%2b" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'fim++'" rel="tag">fim++</a> interpreter in <a href="/questions/tagged/lolcode" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'lolcode'" rel="tag">lolcode</a>. Till then!</p>

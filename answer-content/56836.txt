<p><code>== false</code> is not very readable. Use <code>!</code> instead. </p>

<p>If the "object value" is already of desired type (e.g. DateTime), it would be slower to convert it to string and then back again. </p>

<p>I would write instead</p>

<pre><code>if (value is DateTime) return (DateTime)value;
</code></pre>

<p>I would not use var result = -999; as a return value. </p>

<p>If the conversion fails, you can either return Int32.MinValue (better than -999) or rather null.</p>

<p>Maybe also you would like to check for DBNull.Value? 
So first I would check for null and DBNull.Value, then "value is DateTime" check and the last thing would be DateTime.TryParse.</p>

<p>You're storing the magnitudes like this:</p>

<pre><code>_MAGNITUDE = 'f p n μ m| k M G T P E Z Y'
</code></pre>

<p>This is a serialized format that requires parsing. This is inconvenient and complicates your code. Just store a tuple of tuples, or maybe a dictionary, storing the prefix string and its magnitude. A couple of options are:</p>

<pre><code>(
  ('f', -15),
  ('p', -12),
  ('n', -9),
  # ...

(
   'mμnpf',  # Negative prefixes
   'kMGTPEZY'  # Positive prefixes
)
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise... wow, this is a lot of code. It's not written terribly, but for what this is - a data-processing tool - I think it's suffering from some feature bloat. The coroutine implementation is interesting, but you don't really need this pile of code - seeing anything described as magic always gives me a sinking feeling, particularly in Python. For instance, for generic broadcasting, you can just store an iterable of function references.</p>

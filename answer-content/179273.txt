<p>This function shouldn't be needed.</p>

<p>I have a feeling that you wrote it for some imaginary people and without any particular use case in mind. And out of the false assumptions too. Neither more than one shuffle is required and you never need to shuffle an associative array. So just raw shuffle() is enough.</p>

<p>And you can always use <code>$arr[array_rand($arr)];</code> instead of <code>getRandom($arr)</code>; to get just a single value.</p>

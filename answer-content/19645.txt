<p>Theoretically deadlock can occur in your code(There is a small probability, especially this probability rises when you run your code on a single core system). </p>

<p>Suppose such situation in which philosophers are enumerated clockwise.
<strong>1st</strong> philosophers acquire a lock on left chopstick, then test if left and right chopstics are free(at start they can be free) and right after that <strong>2nd</strong> philosopher(which sits right to first) also acquire a lock on his left chopstick. So the 1st philosopher will be blocked on his right chopstick's monitor. </p>

<p><strong>3rd</strong> and <strong>4th</strong> philosophers repeat described process after 1st and 2nd philosopher. </p>

<p>And the lst <strong>5th</strong> philosophers will acquire a lock on his left chopstick's monitor and will be blocked on his right chopsticks monitor while testing its availability.</p>

<p>This probability is rather small but it can occur. And if it can occur then I think it is not a valid code. Deadlock's propability has to be equal to 0, then it will be a valid code.</p>

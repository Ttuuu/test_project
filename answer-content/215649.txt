<p>If this is a class assignment, you might ask your professor why you spend time reading test data from keyboard instead of writing unit tests. Or if you really have to, at least use a Scanner to learn how the standard libraries work. That's what everyone else does in their classes. Nobody reads input from keyboard outside of the classroom in the extent the classroom examples would imply.</p>

<p>Operating on the input character-by-character makes the code a bit hard to read. Instead split the string using regexps: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3760152/split-string-to-equal-length-substrings-in-java">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3760152/split-string-to-equal-length-substrings-in-java</a></p>

<p>Java also comes with a built in reverse function in the StringBuilder class.</p>

<p>You have made reversing the hash a responsibility of the caller (e.g. you do it in the main method). The assignment says it should be part of the hash function, so your implementation is incomplete. Also, the hash function is private so it can not be used unless the data is read from System in. Make the hash function a separate class and the input handling another.</p>

<p>Underscores don't belong in Java method naming convention. Use <code>reverseHash</code> instead of <code>reverse_hash</code>.</p>

<p>Make all fields and arguments <code>final</code>, unless you mean to change their value.</p>

<p>Don't worry about optimization until you have enough data to know for sure what part of your code is a bottleneck.</p>

<p>Some people say RuntimeExceptions shouldn't be declared in the method signature. I say that is a stupid ass opinion, since NumberFormatException is used as a return value for malformed input here. So, in my opinion, you should declare <code>throws NumberFormatException</code> that so that whoever uses your code can prepare for it. Or if you don't want to declare it, catch it and handle errors in other manner.</p>

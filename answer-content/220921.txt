  <p>I've thought about a factory method, but that won't work because it
  can't be translated to SQL by the expression interpreter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why don't you call (as suggested by t3chb0t) <code>AsEnumerable()</code> right before your factory method? You would perform the factory method in memory.</p>

<pre><code> var project = entities.Tickets
        .Where(p =&gt; p.ID == id)
        .AsEnumerable()   // &lt;-- loads the tickets into memory
        .Select(p =&gt; myFactoryMethod(p))
        .Single();
</code></pre>

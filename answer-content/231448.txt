<p>The simplest approach I can think of is to use a <code>reduce</code> and let it handle the boring stuff for us:</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>from functools import reduce

def get_value_by_path(container, path):
    return reduce(dict.__getitem__, path, container)

get_value_by_path(d, ["d", "4", "ddd"])
# 'd3'
</code></pre>

<p>As for performance, I tested it on your repl.it link and it seems to run in about 2 seconds with your test data. So maybe not the fastest approach, but not the slowest either, and the least complex one IMO.</p>

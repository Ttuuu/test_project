<p>Not exactly a review, but since you are asking for simpler way... The simpler way is to run your tasks via dispatcher. Just run it on background thread:</p>

<pre><code>_thread = new Thread(() =&gt;
               {
                   _dispatcher = Dispatcher.CurrentDispatcher;
                   Dispatcher.Run();
               });
_thread.Start();
</code></pre>

<p>And use <code>_dispatcher.BeginInvoke</code> and <code>_dispatcher.Invoke</code> to run your tasks on that thread.
It is a lot simpler than reinventing the wheel. The obvious downside is wpf dependency.</p>

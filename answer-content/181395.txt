<h2>Is method 1 considered quick sort since it splits the array?</h2>

<p>It is quick sort because you split the array in parts lesser and greater than the pivot, and recursivly sorting these arrays.</p>

<h2>Would this just be messy doing another overload?</h2>

<p>No. The <code>quickSort</code> with the extra params is internal, so callers from outside the class won't even see it.</p>

<h2>Which one is best to use?</h2>

<p>That depends on what you call 'better'. I prefer the first method because I find it much easier to understand. The second has (I suspect) better performance, because you create less objects. </p>

<h2>Note</h2>

<p>While you probably need to return an <code>ArrayList</code> because of the given signature, it is preferred to return the interface <code>List</code>. See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/147468/why-should-the-interface-for-a-java-class-be-preferred%20here">here</a></p>

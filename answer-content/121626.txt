<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>I know I'm late, but you can:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Only test 11-20, since if 12 is divisible, 6 is as well. if 14 is, then 7 is. etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Count by 20s, since 20 is the largest number and it can't be divisible by anything between 0 and 20, 20 and 40, 40 and 60, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Don't test all the numbers; stop once you find one to not work. Also don't test 20 if you apply #2 since you know it'll work.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Just a nitpick about naming: the "find" in <code>findSquareSum</code> is meaningless, and perhaps even misleading, since it's not searching for anything.  Just <code>squareSum</code> would be fine.  Even better, call it something like <code>sumSquaresOfDigits</code> to be explicit about what the function does.</p>

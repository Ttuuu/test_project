<p>First, thank you for including a docstring that explained how the script works; it saved me a good couple of minutes in puzzling it out.  :)  It turned out to be a lot simpler than I initially thought it was, which suggests an easy path to optimizing it for space.</p>

<p>The error that your program hits with large numbers is a <code>MemoryError</code>, which is a result of the dictionary that you build which includes every number prior to your number (or, potentially, the roughly-equally-massive list that you then unnecessarily convert that dictionary into).</p>

<p>Since you're only interested in one piece of data (is any of these numbers zero?), and since the computation of the numbers doesn't depend on any of the numbers before them, there's no need to store them all in memory.  As soon as one of the values of <code>r</code> (aka <code>pr % x</code>; there's not really any reason to name or store it since you only look at it once) is 0, you know that the number isn't prime; that's all there is to it.</p>

<p>The core of your program stays the same.  Just skip the part where you build the giant dictionary and the giant list, and have the program finish immediately once it knows what the answer is:</p>

<pre><code>pr = int(input("Enter your number: "))

x = pr - 1
while x &gt; 1 :
    if pr % x == 0:
        print(pr, "is not a prime number")
        exit()
    x -= 1
print(pr, "is a prime number")
</code></pre>

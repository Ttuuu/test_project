<p>This code is already quite compact. Some <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="noreferrer">PEP8</a> code styling will not hurt. Some spaces here and there, consistency in using quotes in string literals. Also some comments can be turned into <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/" rel="noreferrer">docstrings</a>. (and comment like "constructor" is not necessary - everyone who knows Python will recognize that).</p>

<p>However, one thing probably good to make sure: The balance better use proper type, for example, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/decimal.html" rel="noreferrer">decimal</a>. Float is terribly wrong type for monetary transactions.</p>

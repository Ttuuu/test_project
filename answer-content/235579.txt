<ul>
<li>stop using recompose because it got deprecated and you don't need it if you use react hooks.</li>
<li>transform your components and use react hooks because it's an anti-pattern to use them with class components.</li>
<li>Try to decompose your components more like for the shell components it's a heavy component try to extract for say the drawer component to its own file Drawer.JS then use it in Shell component also try to extract the style object that you pass to the makeStyles function for material-UI this all to make your code more maintainable.</li>
<li>try to avoid repeating your self like in the shell component try to optimize your algorithm.</li>
<li>separate the view logic from the service logic like for the sign in components componentDidMount() function you have to separate that two logic and create a new level of abstraction "basically a function that handles the DB logic " and just execute it there.</li>
<li>now for the last question the difficulty you are having I don't quite understand it, I have reviewed your demo and i didn't encounter a problem after I signed in.</li>
</ul>

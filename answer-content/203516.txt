  <p>Welcome to Code Review!</p>

<p>It is a good practice if you start verifying your shell scripts <a href="https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck" rel="nofollow noreferrer">against shellcheck</a>. Currently, it lists quite a few issues:</p>

<pre><code>Line 3:

<p>In addition to shellcheck advices; I'd also point that you currently have a very long script executing statements one after the other. Split them into multiple small functions and call them as you deem fit.</p>

<hr>

<p>Why do you wait 10 seconds when the number of required arguments was not available? Since it is a non-zero exit, user will anyway get sufficiently notified. Same goes for the <code>sleep 5</code> and <code>10</code> just after the parameter count check.</p>

<hr>

<p>You redirect <code>echo "export CURRENTDIR=\"/tmp/svaka\""</code> twice to 2 different files. Make use of <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tee.1.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>tee</code></a> and pipe the echo a single time.</p>

<hr>

<p>You have a lot of stub code in the script. Clean it up; remove unused statements/declarations/tasks and post another question with the updated code.</p>

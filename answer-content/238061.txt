<p>There are a few compiler errors that may not have show up for you, the first major compiler problem is that <code>read</code> is a basic function in C input and output so the variable declaration <code>ssize_t read;</code> should be changed to something like <code>size_t readsize</code>. It might be good if you compiled with the -w flags to add warnings to the compiler error messages.</p>

<p>The second problem I see is that you might have compiled this with a C++ compiler rather than a C compiler, a strict C compiler will not recognize the function <code>readline()</code> in a strict C compiler <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/fgets/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">fgets()</a> should be used instead. You will have to make the variable <code>line</code> an array of characters.</p>

<pre><code>char line[BUFSIZ];
</code></pre>

<p>The symbolic constant BUFSIZ is defined in the include file <code>stdio.h</code>.</p>

<pre><code>    fgets(line, BUFSIZ, fp);
</code></pre>

<p>Overall it would be better if <code>main()</code> was a short function that called other functions, it is currently too complex (does too much).</p>

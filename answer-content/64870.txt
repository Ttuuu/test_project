<p>I would leave this code as-is.</p>

<p>I feel in this case we <strong>should</strong> propagate a NullReferenceException as that does actually accurately describe the error that has occurred. You would gain little from wrapping this exception in another exception. The only exception (heh) in my opinion would be if you wanted to wrap this exception in a domain-specific exception (<code>new MyLibraryException(ref)</code>) but this is debatable even then. By using a null reference exception you clearly signal to the programmer that the line on which it failed had a null reference exception (in this case, it is obvious that <code>_detail[id]</code> is null - in the case of <code>_detail[id]</code> being out of bounds, we would throw an <code>ArrayOutOfBoundsException</code>).</p>

<p>In other words, there's little need for you to 'wrap' managed exceptions. Most competent programmers will understand them, rather than your domain specific ones.</p>

<h2>Standard docstrings</h2>

<p>Rather than</p>

<pre><code>#pauses the story
def print_pause(lines):
</code></pre>

<p>the standard is to do:</p>

<pre><code>def print_pause(lines):
    """
    pauses the story
    """
</code></pre>

<p>It'd be a good idea to add similar documentation to your other functions.</p>

<h2>f-strings</h2>

<p>This:</p>

<pre><code>print("You chose " + answer + ".")
</code></pre>

<p>can be</p>

<pre><code>print(f'You chose {answer}.')
</code></pre>

<p>similar instances elsewhere.</p>

<h2>Hard wraps?</h2>

<p>This:</p>

<pre><code>"Unfortunately the KGB wants you to keep quiet about what you went\nthrough so a splinter faction kills you to make sure you don't leak\nany info."
</code></pre>

<p>shouldn't really include newlines. A proper terminal will auto-wrap on character based on the width of the terminal. If you want to be more careful and wrap on the word, do a little reading about the <code>textwrap</code> library:</p>

<h2>General</h2>

<p>Your game logic is very simple. As such, consider re-representing your game as a very small game engine, and a set of data - perhaps represented in a .json file - that represents outputs and choices.</p>

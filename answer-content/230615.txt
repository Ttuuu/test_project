<p>All in all, you did quite well.
If you have the option, I'd recommend letting a system like Active Directory handle user credentials rather than storing and validating themselves. However, as there's a cost involved with that, password hashes are the next best thing.</p>

<p>PBKDF2 is a better choice than what I'm used to people using and you're salting it too, so kudos on that. (Argon2id and SCrypt are also good options. MD5 and SHA1 should not be used for passwords. SHA2 is on its way out. I don't know enough about SHA3 to comment.)</p>

<p>I noticed that you have your connection string hard coded. I'm not sure if that's just for the code example or not, but it would be a good idea to move that outside of your code base (even though it doesn't have a password in it).</p>

<p>Forget about what they asked for, and think about what it really means.</p>

<p>Having a match means that at least one of the donor strings contains no characters that aren't in the recipient string, except for possibly the placeholders "O" and "-".</p>

<p>So check for that:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;malloc.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

    int
main(int argc, char **argv) {
    if (argc&gt;2) {
        auto int index;
        auto char **donor;
        auto char *donee = strcat(strcpy(malloc(3+strlen(argv[1])), argv[1]), "-O");
        for (donor=&amp;argv[2]; *donor; ++donor) {
            for (index=0; index[*donor]; ++index)
                if (!strchr(donee, index[*donor])) break;
            if (!index[*donor]) return puts("Match"), 0;
        }
    }
    return puts("No match\n"), 1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The unnecessary placeholders, "O" and "-", should have been stripped from the donor strings, but in this case it was easier to add them to the recipient string.</p>

<p>Note that except for that special case, this code has nothing specific to human blood types.  The same program will work for Vulcans too (Spok is "T-").</p>

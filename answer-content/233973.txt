<p>Why use global variables? Why not pass those values into the function as arguments?</p>

<pre><code>sample_features = 2 .* ( rand( 10 , 3 ) .- 0.5 ) ;
sample_targets = [ 1 ; 1 ; 1 ; 1 ; 0 ; 0 ; 0 ; 0 ; 1 ; 0 ] ;
x = [ 3 , 1 , 3 , 0.9 , 1 , 0.1 ] ; 
J = rvfl_training_of_cyclic_embedding ( x, sample_features, sample_targets ) ;
</code></pre>

<p>Global variables make debugging harder and actually slow down the code. You should avoid them where possible. Here they don't do anything special, to me it looks like a lazy solution to a simple problem.</p>

<p>To call your optimization algorithm with this function, simply do</p>

<pre><code>fun = @( x ) rvfl_training_of_cyclic_embedding ( x, sample_features, sample_targets );
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>The function does</p>

<pre><code>rand( 'seed' , 0 ) ;
randn( 'seed' , 0 ) ;
</code></pre>

<p>at the beginning and</p>

<pre><code>rand( 'state' ) ; randn( 'state' ) ; ## reset rng
</code></pre>

<p>at the end. This is a really bad practice. <code>rand('seed',0)</code> sets the random number generator to the <code>'seed'</code> method, which is an old-fashioned RNG with really poor properties. <code>rand('state')</code> returns it to the <code>'state'</code> method, which is the Mersenne Twister according to the <a href="https://octave.sourceforge.io/octave/function/rand.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>. The only reason to use the old generator is to reproduce old results. Please don't use it!</p>

<p>Style:</p>

<p>I have been using MATLAB since somewhere in the 1990's. I like the Octave project, but I dislike a few additions to the language they made. Using these additions corners your code making it unavailable to us MATLAB users. If instead of using <code>endif</code> and <code>endfor</code> you simply write <code>end</code>, and instead of using <code>#</code> for comments you use <code>%</code>, then your code can more or less directly run under MATLAB. The <code>endfor</code> addition seems pointless to me, indenting should show what the <code>end</code> applies to. The <code>#</code> comments are also highly unnecessary IMO.</p>

<p>If you write a comment block at the beginning of your function (either before or after the <code>function</code> line) then that block will be displayed when you type <code>help rvfl_training_of_cyclic_embedding</code>. </p>

<p>Depending on how far you want to take this, as with all optimizations these are all things that will be dependent on measurements </p>

<p>Going from array of bool to a bitarray might give you an improvement by reducing the number of times that the L2 cache has to be accessed. It depends if the amount of arithmetic you have to do is paid of by the reduced number of cache swaps </p>

<p>Unrolling your core loop, and doing multiple operations in a row might help dependent on what the compiler does ( there might already be some unrolling going on) this will let the CPU perform multiple longer operations at the same time.</p>

<p>Lastly using vector operation could also make this faster but again the logic will become more complex. </p>

<p><strong>Naming</strong></p>

<p>Firstly, you must change the names from V to say "numberOfVertices" and "E" to numberOfEdges. The functions to get the numberOfVertices would be named as "getNumberOfVertices" and so on. Try to make the naming such that comments become entirely unnecessary.Similarly, adj should at least be named as "adjacencyList".</p>

<pre><code>LinkedList&lt;Integer&gt; llOne = new LinkedList&lt;&gt;();
LinkedList&lt;Integer&gt; llTwo = new LinkedList&lt;&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>are also not suitably named.</p>

<pre><code> StringBuilder returnString = new StringBuilder();
</code></pre>

<p>Bad name again. It does not convey any other information that it is supposed to be returned and it is a string.</p>

<p><strong><em>Usability</em></strong></p>

<p>How is this graph supposed to be used outside this class? The only information that you are allowing someone to access is the number of vertices, edges and stringified graph. How is the user of this class supposed to traverse this graph if he needs to? </p>

<p>It's more natural to say <code>"--loglevel", ...</code> than <code>"--log", dest="loglevel", ...</code>. A log switch suggests that it takes an argument of a logfile output filename.</p>

<p>Not sure why you need <code>dest</code> for the logfile argument.</p>

<p>You're specifying type of <code>str</code> which is already the default, but maybe you did it to help with type annotations?</p>

<p>Raising "Invalid logging level" is maybe superfluous, better to let the underlying logging library deal with it. Looks like you're reaching across layers.</p>

<p>Naming your module <code>log</code> is perhaps a bit adventurous, as sometimes folks concisely write <code>log.info()</code> instead of <code>logger.info()</code>.</p>

<p>In the example, I recommend deleting:</p>

<pre><code>logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
</code></pre>

<p>in favor of <code>conf_logging(logging.getLogger(__name__), args.loglevel, args.logfile)</code>.
Perhaps you'd like to make it more convenient for callers, by defaulting loglevel, and letting a caller just pass in <code>__name__</code> if that's all that is interesting.</p>

<p>Overall, it looks like a useful utility.</p>

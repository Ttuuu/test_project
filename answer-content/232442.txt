<p><strong>Definitely don't do this</strong>. The value should be on the same line as the variable being set. People read lines of code line-by-line, it's really confusing to see a lonely <code>false;</code>. Also, use line braces <code>{</code> <code>}</code> even when the code to be executed is 1 line long. And put the code all on a new line)</p>

<pre><code>if (field.bombArray[i][j] == "x" &amp;&amp; document.getElementById(newId).style.backgroundColor != "red") check =
                false;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Try to keep code separated in ways that make sense. Marking a bomb should not contain logic for checking if the player won</strong>. You also shouldn't run the <code>checkWin</code> method here. </p>

<p>For game-related reasons, checking if player won when a bomb is marked doesn't make sense. Does the player need to mark all bombs to win?</p>

<p><strong>Stay away from magic numbers / magic Strings</strong>, use constants instead.</p>

<p><strong>Use comments</strong> to explain parts of your code. What you are doing with the <code>newId</code> variable could probably be done better/differently, but tbh It's hard to follow. You could make it into a method (And still document if the name doens't explain well enough).</p>

<p>The design looks solid, a few thoughts though:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I would split <code>IUserVoiceStore</code> into more granular <code>UserRepository</code> and <code>SuggestionRepository</code>. Also, <code>UpdateSuggestionAsync()</code> seems to indicate you can only update a suggestion and nothing else at a time, which can be limiting. It also IMO goes out of a repository's jurisdiction to flush a specific object to persistent storage. Using some kind of separate unit of work class where you can put multiple objects to be updated as part of a business transaction might be a better idea.</p></li>
<li><p>Not always feasible, but maybe change the type of link between <code>Suggestion</code> and <code>User</code> from a full reference to just an ID to avoid the temptation of manipulating 2 aggregate roots at the same time. <em>(I don't agree with the article you linked to in that regard)</em></p></li>
<li><p>Keep an eye on suggestions with a large number of comments - depending on concurrent access, they can clog up your system and cause locking problems, especially if comments become more sophisticated, with images and so on.</p></li>
</ul>

<li>I guess the idea behind using permutations is that any permutation of the same digits will result in the same squared sum. However... in that case, shouldn't we simply calculate the squared sum and cache that?</li>
<li>It appears that we're only caching the permutations of the digits at the end of the chain. i.e. we'll only ever end up with 1, 89 and 98 in the map! We should probably be caching all the values in the chain up to the final result.</li>
<li><code>#include &lt;string&gt;</code> for <code>std::to_string</code>.</li>
<li>Converting to and from <code>std::string</code> is probably quite slow. We can use simple integer arithmetic to extract the individual digits.</li>
<li>The implementation of <code>sumOfDigitsSquared</code> is clearly incorrect with basic testing.</li>

<h3>Corner cases</h3>

<p>You correctly handle the corner cases of too short input and null input.
But you forgot to handle the case of all same characters, for example "aaa".
On such input the program throws <code>StringIndexOutOfBoundsException</code> on line <code>secondUnique = s.charAt(i);</code>.</p>

<h3>Variable scope</h3>

<p>The variable <code>c</code> is only needed within the main <code>for</code> loop,
so it would be best to declare it inside the loop.</p>

<h3>Style</h3>

<p>This is fine:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>for (; (i &lt; len) &amp;&amp; (s.charAt(i) == firstUnique); i++);
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>But it looks a bit strange.
A <code>for</code> loop is easiest to read in its most classing form a counting loop:
it performs some initialization,
then on each iteration it does its main work in the body.
Here, the main work to do is the counting.
So if you transform this to a <code>while</code> loop with a body,
it becomes slightly easier to read.</p>

<li>Question: method and normal variable names in java start with a small letter by convention. As opposed to C#. Is it a special convention of the course?</li>
<li>Repetitive code for array entries.</li>
<li><code>X == true</code> is simply <code>X</code> and <code>X == false</code> is <code>!X</code> (not X).</li>
<li>Parameters <code>f(X[] array, int index)</code> might just be <code>f(X x)</code>. It also might be that then the called method should be a method of <code>X.f()</code>. Call: <code>f(array[index])</code>. (You can change fields of the X inside f.)</li>
<li><code>double haustier</code> (pet) would make me shiver, like <code>double children</code> - int?</li>
</ul>
<p>Now to the question:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subclasses of Room: Penthouse, Besenkammer, ... to be placed in a Room array will probably not be very manageable.</li>
<li>But you have many features of a room and instead of many fields you could have a
<code>RoomProperty</code> and derive subclasses like HavingPet (or whatever) and call overriden
<code>ask()</code>, <code>String toString()</code>, <code>additionalPrice()</code> and so on. <em>That</em> would make sense. And then use a <code>RoomProperty[] properties = new RoomProperties[10];</code>. Instead of fixed size arrays you will later learn dynamic, growing List (i.e. ArrayList).</li>
<li>A penthouse could then be realized by a Room subclass that fills its initial properties with a <code>HavingPet</code>.</li>
</ul>

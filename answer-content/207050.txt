<p>We are getting closer to the off-topic "opinion-based" border</p>

<p>What's readable is a matter of taste. Honestly, i find the @papafaga version less fluent.
You also have the possibility to do the opposite of your second version, to put the particular case before the loop, I do it sometimes when the case is trivial.</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;typename Container, typename Separator&gt;
void pretty_print4(const Container&amp; c, const Separator&amp; s) {
    if (c.empty()) return;

    auto it = std::begin(c); 
    std::cout &lt;&lt; *it;
    std::advance(it,1);
    while (it != std::end(c)) {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; s;
        std::cout &lt;&lt; *it;
        std::advance(it,1);
    } 
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you talk about performance, I think all versions are worth. Without optimizations, some versions generate more instructions than others, but once in <code>-O3</code>, except one or two instructions, it's almost the same. After, if it really matters, you have to look at the machine code and benchmark.</p>

<p>If all of the numbers in x are unique, this works:</p>

<pre><code>x = [4,7,9,10,6,11,3]
seq = sorted(x)
index = [seq.index(v) for v in x]
</code></pre>

<p>The technique is to sort the input list, then look up the position of each value from the original list in the sorted one, storing the results in a list via list comprehension. </p>

<p>It will have trouble if the numbers in x are non-unique, because when the list is sorted there will be two identical numbers next to each other and index() will find the first one. This might be beneficial, as technically the numbers are indeed the same rank, but it will also mean there is a "hole" in the ranking order (for example, if two numbers are tied for third, the fourth rank will actually be numbered 5 because it will be the 5th entry in the sorted list)</p>

<p>It also involves creating a sorted copy of the original list so may take up extra memory if the list is large.</p>

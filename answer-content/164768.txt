<p>I like your idea. This is a feature I often need.
I tried this on Python 2.7.</p>

<p>The first problem was no <code>tkinter</code> module (I have <code>Tkinter</code>) and no <code>filedialog</code> present in it. I had to modify this (according to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25905540/importerror-no-module-named-tkinter">this</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31669945/tkinter-import-filedialog-error">this</a>):</p>

<pre><code>from Tkinter import Tk
import tkFileDialog as filedialog
</code></pre>

<p>Then I had to remove the style changes (no <code>style</code> member).</p>

<p>I've got an error when clicked OK without selecting any file:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TraitError: The 'files' trait of a SelectFilesButton instance must be
  a list, but a value of type 'str' (i.e. '') was specified.</p>

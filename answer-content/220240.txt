<p>Some observations:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Comments</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>// Draws the objects
void drawWindow();

// Handles events
void handleEvents();

// Updates the window
void updateWindow();
</code></pre>

<p>These comments don't tell you anything that the code doesn't already
tell you, so they should be removed. Ideally the code is well named,
like in that example, so you don't feel the need to even write a comment.</p>

<p>Annother advice with that is. If you feel the need, in a long function,
to comment several parts because they do something different it's probably a
good idea to extract the parts into its own functions. Erase the
Comments and makes the code self documentary.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Namespaces</strong>:</p>

<p>You should always put your functions and classes into namespaces to avoid name clashes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>unicode</strong></p>

<pre><code>#ifndef UNICODE
#define UNICODE
#endif
</code></pre>

<p>is this still needed?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>std::endl</strong>:</p>

<p>if you only want a newline you should replace <code>std::endl</code>
with <code>'\n'</code>. </p>

<p><code>std::endl</code> also does a expensive flush operation which is
rarely desired.</p></li>
</ul>

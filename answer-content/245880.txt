<p>If I were your interviewer, I'd not hire you, because of that piece of code.</p>
<p>The one absolute showstopper is that your method prints to System.out instead of returning a boolean.</p>
<p>Even if no one told you explicitly, from a professional developer we expect that algorithms just compute something and give the results to their callers (by means of a boolean return value), and not write it to the user. But your solution mixes the algorithm with text output.</p>
<p>Otherwise, your solution is okay, given the condition that no additional data structure is to be used (by the way, that's a strange condition, not representative for professional development).</p>

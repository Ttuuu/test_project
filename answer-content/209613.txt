  <p>however how can I create a more efficient declaration of the message[] array?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an efficient declaration. </p>

<p>Given that the array is "large enough". A statically allocated array is the fastest option. Though it is of course good practice to check that the input never goes out of bounds of the array.</p>

<p>Trying to save a couple of hundred bytes of memory by implementing some sort of dynamic allocation <code>realloc</code> scheme isn't sensible. It would slow down the program significantly.</p>

<p>There exists two kinds of computer systems. Systems where dynamic heap allocation makes sense, such as a PC, and systems where it doesn't, such as microcontroller embedded systems. </p>

<p>In case of the former, you have plenty of RAM and you don't need to worry about 100 bytes here or there on the stack. In case of the latter, you could be short on RAM, but neither dynamic memory allocation nor user input from stdin make sense.</p>

<p>The idea of the test class is ok: you want to test the service, mock the repository and you check on the outcome.</p>

<p>In the test, it would be nice to use the AAA (arrange/act/assert) pattern. In my tests, i call these setup, execute and verify.</p>

<p>There is no logic in the service layer, and your method returns the database objects.
Also you only have one test, with an empty arraylist. What if you find 1,2,..1000 items. What would you return, the whole list or the first 10,...
Additional questions you can have: In what order are they returned? Are you handling errors,...</p>

<p>Imagine some logic on your service layer and these tests will get more to it </p>

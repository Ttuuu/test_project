<p>Here are some things I would improve:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I think the method is overly loaded with code and is not readable. Consider applying <a href="https://refactoring.com/catalog/extractMethod.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Extract Method</a> refactoring method and adding clarifying comments explaining what different parts of code do - it is not immediately clear what is happening in the code.</p></li>
<li><p>since you are interacting with multiple elements on a page, it might make sense to build a <a href="https://www.guru99.com/page-object-model-pom-page-factory-in-selenium-ultimate-guide.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Page Object</a> abstraction around the page and logic behind filling the form out.</p></li>
<li><p>make sure you definitely need the AutoIT part for the file upload - I've personally had to automated file upload logic via selenium a lot of times and I've never encountered the need to make use of extra automation tools.</p>

<p>The idea is to locate the <code>input</code> element with <code>type="file"</code> and send the absolute path to the desired file to upload via <code>sendKeys()</code>. Sometimes  the file upload input is hidden - in these cases, you can <em>make it visible</em> and then send the file upload path to it.  </p></li>
<li><p>make sure the naming is <em>consistent</em>. You are using both <code>camelCase</code> and <code>lower_case_with_underscore</code> variable and method naming styles.</p></li>
<li><p>I don't really think that comments like <code>// *****...*****</code> make the code more readable. Consider putting newlines between for visual separation between blocks of code. These parts would probably naturally go away if you would extract methods and/or use Page Object pattern. </p></li>
<li><p>recheck if you definitely need the thread sleep delays - you are using Explicit Waits and it should be enough to tackle timing issues.</p></li>
</ul>

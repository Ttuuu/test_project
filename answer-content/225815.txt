<h2>Meta discussions vs Code comments</h2>

<p>You should distinguish comments meant for discussion with team members and code comments. Since you work in a team, I take it you have a source control system. For instance, GIT allows to make a <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Pull Request</a>. This means you put your code up for the team to review. Comments can be made on this pull request, rather than polluting the code. You can even set a policy that all comments need to be 'resolved' before the code is allowed to be merged back into the master branch.</p>

<h3>Review</h3>

<p>A note on your choice of tags. You use (1) for self and (2) for team members. What if team members use the same system? Who would be the author of tag (1)? Choose your tags more carefully regarding the fact you are a team.</p>

  <p><em>I want to differentiate between comments I make for</em></p>
  
  <p><em>(1) myself, (2) team members, ..</em></p>

<p>Perhaps it's not such a bad thing that TODO's are intrusive. This gives you an additional motivation to refactor the code and work those TODO's out.</p>

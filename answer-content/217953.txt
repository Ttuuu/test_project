<li><p><code>isset()</code> accepts multiple parameters, you can simplify:</p>

<pre><code>if (isset($parameters["inserted_id"]) &amp;&amp; isset($parameters["inserted_password"])) {
</code></pre>

<p>To</p>

<pre><code>if (isset($parameters["inserted_id"], $parameters["inserted_password"])) {
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>When ever I read anyone's code or database schema and I see any mention of <code>id</code>, I immediately assume that I am dealing with a positive integer.  If the value is anything other than a positive integer, I never use <code>id</code> in the field/column/variable name.</p></li>
<li><p>I never use mysqli's <code>init()</code> call because it is optional.  I'll recommend objected-oriented mysqli syntax because it is less verbose.</p></li>
<li><p>I don't think I'd json encode/decode your form data -- it seems like unnecessary extra data handling.  See here: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/5004233/2943403">jQuery Ajax POST example with PHP</a></p></li>
<li><p><code>echo</code> doesn't need those parentheses. </p></li>
<li><p>I am confident that @YourCommonSense will post a comprehensive answer containing the 3 pieces of commented advice and more, so I'll leave those recommendations to him.</p></li>
<li><p>You don't need to write out all those <code>close()</code> calls, just <code>echo</code> your message and let the script end naturally.  If you're going to kill the script at <code>if (isset($_SESSION['user_id'])) {</code> be sure to sure to echo something for consistency. </p></li>
<li><p>I find javascript <code>alert()</code> boxes to be terribly annoying and a bit trashy to be honest.  Give your site some "class" and fashion an attractive presentation for any response messages that you plan to offer.</p></li>
<li><p>Your .html has form fields, but no form -- that doesn't feel valid to me.  I'll recommend adding the form tags and names attributes.  Some discussions: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/33370025/2943403">https://stackoverflow.com/q/33370025/2943403</a></p></li>

<p>It looks like what you've given us is a system that takes a string and parses it into a semantic command. </p>

<p>About the code you've shown, I would suggest building less stuff yourself. Your whole parsing system should probably just be a (compiled) regex with capture groups. I do suggest using a dictionary instead of a switch statement. All that will probably make this system a lot smaller and easier to read, and <em>may</em> make it more performant. </p>

<p>That said, this routing system (hopefully) isn't the performance bottleneck, and you're asking how to improve performance. You need to look at the system <em>that gets the list of command strings in the first place</em>, and you need to look at the system(s) that <em>run the commands</em>.</p>

<p>Probably your end goal will be a stream reader feeding an asynchronous for-each loop with shared pools of connections to outside resources. But we can't see most of that system from here, and if there are "only" 100k items to process it <em>might</em> be overkill.</p>

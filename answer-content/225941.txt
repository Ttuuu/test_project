<p>I think the problem could be, that your algorithm isn't exactly a selection sort but rater a bubble sort. They are very similar, but where bubble sort swaps every two elements when the left is smaller than the right (descending order), selection sort defers swapping to after the inner loop is finished and then only swaps the last found candidate with the <code>index'th</code> element.</p>

<p>To accomplish that in your algorithm, you can modify it as follows:</p>

<pre><code>function selectionSort(array) {
  let index = 0;
  let length = array.length;
  let nextElementIndex = 0;

  while (index &lt; length - 1) {
    nextElementIndex = index + 1;

    let maxIndex = index; // This will hold the index of the possible last candidate for swapping.

    while (nextElementIndex &lt; length) {
      if (array[maxIndex ] &lt; array[nextElementIndex]) {
        // Instead of swapping here, only the index of the candidate is saved.
        maxIndex = nextElementIndex;
      }
      nextElementIndex++;
    }

    // And finally: if any element to the right of index is greater than the element at index then swap.
    if (maxIndex != index) {
      [array[index], array[maxIndex ]] = [array[maxIndex ], array[index]];
    }

    index++;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>A suggestion that may improve readability could be to use <code>for</code>-loops instead of <code>while</code> -loops</p>

<p>In general, you could use some proper validation of the user input...</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>    Console.WriteLine("0. Exit Program");

<p>I don't think that entering "0" actually exit the program. It just goes to <code>default</code> in the switch statement and continues the outer while-loop.</p>

<p>If you should have one general try-catch block in the loop or dedicated ones must depend on what you want to do after an exception is thrown/caught in each case. In your code one single block should be sufficient, because you in all cases break the switch and reenter the outer while loop.</p>

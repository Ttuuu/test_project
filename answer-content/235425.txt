<p>It may not be what you are supposed to be learning, but if you use brute force to solve Sudoku, you'll do fine with easy ones (30 clues, asymmetric), but you'll struggle with difficult ones (fewer than 20 clues, symmetrical diagonally) - so why not use a SAT solver library like Google OR Tools to do the solving? Learning to use 3rd party libraries in your program would be an invaluable software development skill, and you'll probably get the fastest solver in your class!</p>

<p>If you choose to do this, your solver will need 9 binary variables for each square - one for each of the possible numbers 1-9.</p>

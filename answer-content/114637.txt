<p>This is not a good way to read in data. You have a <code>.txt</code> file purely just to read in a name. You're also reliant on data being in the right form. If someone tried to put in multiple names</p>

<pre><code>A really slow typer
A really fast typer
I don't type
</code></pre>

<p>Then you mangle them all together in <code>name</code>:</p>

<pre><code>with open("NAME_FILE.txt") as f:
    name = "".join(f.readlines())
print(name)
# A really slow typerA really fast typerI don't type
</code></pre>

<p>Instead you should use JSON. <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html" rel="noreferrer">Python has a builtin JSON library</a> you can import and use. You could easily save and load data from a single <code>.json</code> file with it. You would just need to store them all in a dictionary, then use <code>json.dump</code> to write the data to a file. </p>

<pre><code>import json

data = {
        'name': name,
        'high_score': high_score,
        'words': WORDS,
       }
with open(filename, 'w') as f:
    json.dump(data, f, indent=4)
</code></pre>

<p>(note <code>indent</code> is an optional parameter that will indent the levels of nesting for your json file. I used it here for readability, especially as you have relatively little data to format)</p>

<p>You can then easily load the data in a similar way:</p>

<pre><code>import json

with open(filename) as f:
    data = json.load(f)

name = data['name']
high_score = data['high_score']
WORDS = data['words']
</code></pre>

<p>This will save you a lot of fixing data since you're saving it from Python in the form you'll want ot read it again. No need to reformat strings every time you open the program.</p>

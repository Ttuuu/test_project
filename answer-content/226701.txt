<p><strong>DRY Code</strong><br>
The code is very long when it doesn't need to be, and it is very repetitive.</p>

<p>There is a programming principle called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Don't Repeat Yourself Principle</a> sometimes referred to as DRY code. If you find yourself repeating the same code multiple times it is better to encapsulate it in a function. If it is possible to loop through the code that can reduce repetition as well.</p>

<p>You can use a data structure as an array to contain the alphabet. If the current letter in the array then if delimiter is false, otherwise return true. If the current letter is not in the alphabet move on to the next letter.</p>

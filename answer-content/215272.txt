<p>So if I know that someone has an account with e-mail address <code>foo@example.com</code>, I can register with</p>

<pre><code>{
  "first_name": "",

  "dob": "1900-01-01",
  "email": "randomNumber@example.com",
  "account_name": "foo@example.com",
  "password": "password"

<p>and have a 50/50 chance of gaining control of their account?</p>

<p>Why does the signup ask for an e-mail address? If it's used to send e-mail, the process seems to be missing a verification step. If it isn't used, you shouldn't ask it.</p>

<p>Similarly, is there a good reason to ask for date of birth? If not, collecting it would be a violation of GDPR.</p>

<p>If you scale to 30k users (including bots, tests, etc) then you can expect to see a collision. Why not rely on the database's autoincrement?</p>

<p>Usually I start with pros, but I didn't find any. Sorry... </p>

<h2>cons</h2>

<h3>General coding</h3>

<p>You have only static methods.
Java is an <em>object oriented</em> programming language, so get used to use objects. 
You may later find the benefits of it when it comes to polymorphism.</p>

<h3>Naming</h3>

<p>You don't use Java Naming conventions which is in general: </p>

<ul>
<li>Identifiers use CamelCaseNaming except constants which are all UPPER_CASE. </li>
<li>Class names begin with capital letter.</li>
<li>Methods and variables begin with a lower case letter.</li>
<li>Methods begin with a "do" word (a verb).</li>
<li>Variables are "thing" words (nouns).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Inheritance</h3>

<p>Your class <code>Adventure</code> extends your <code>TheGame</code> class.
This looks OK at first glance since you schould use inheritance when you have an "is a" relationship which is obviously true for <em>Adventure</em> and <em>TheGame</em> by means of the words.</p>

<p>But if we look closer to what the classes really do then it is false: <code>Adventure</code> is only launching <code>TheGame</code> so its name is misleading and the inheritance is not justified.</p>

<h3>Code duplication</h3>

<p>This code has lots of duplicated code.</p>

<p>This should be extracted to parameterized methods.</p>

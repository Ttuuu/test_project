<p>Instead of using short variable names, I recommend you use descriptive ones.</p>

<p>It is always better to use a more descriptive variable name than to use a short name which requires a comment to explain what it is.</p>

<p>Also, I donâ€™t suggest using the opposite of negation (!not) as this also can confuse the reader who is trying to make sense of the code.</p>

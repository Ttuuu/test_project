<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>First of all you are getting single response with all staff detail in single dictionary so </p>

<p><em>Why you are filtering in different array ?</em></p>

<p><strong>Suggestion</strong> : You can use filtering on single dictionary with all sub array in it and access by position and show its in your tableView.</p>

<p><strong>Structure of Dictionary is :</strong></p>

<pre><code>{
   @"Minister":[&lt;Your Minister array&gt;],
   @"Pastor":[&lt;Your Pastor&gt;],
   @"Worship &amp; Creative Arts Director":[&lt;Your Worship &amp; Creative Arts Director Array"&gt;],
   @"Financial Advisor":[&lt;Your Financial Advisor array&gt;],
   @"Community Group Organizer":[&lt;Your Community Group Organizer array&gt;],

}
</code></pre>

<p>And based on this you can design your code for table View sections and Cells.</p>

<p>Hope this will helps how we can use minimal Array Container and use it to display data.</p>

<p>Nice Code!</p>

<p>One simple suggestion. Add a constructor with capacity and initialize the List with that capacity.
If you don't have the capacity preinitialize everytime you Add a new element to the list it has to do a resize and that has a time complexity of O(N) so you are losing the O(log N).</p>

<p>For the most part, you are assuming valid numeric values, nothing will get you a s0c7 faster. In laymans terms, an system completion code 0C7 aka s0c7.  It means 'attempting to perform numeric operations on non numeric data.'  BTW, if the user enters a space thinking that means zero, bam, s0c7.</p>

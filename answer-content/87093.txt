<p>Without having looked in-depth in your code I would say to use <code>std::vector</code> instead of <code>new/delete</code> (in fact you forgot to call delete) and to use <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/random/uniform_int_distribution" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>std::uniform_int_distribution</code></a> instead of <code>rand() % n</code>.  The latter can introduce <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10984974/why-do-people-say-there-is-modulo-bias-when-using-a-random-number-generator">bias</a> however it is not very important in this example.</p>

<p>Also to answer your pointer question I always implement merge sort <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort#Bottom-up_implementation" rel="nofollow noreferrer">bottom-up</a>.  You can allocate your \$\mathcal{O}(n)\$ extra space once and only once and then by swapping pointers you can avoid copying the sorted array back to itself except potentially at the end.</p>

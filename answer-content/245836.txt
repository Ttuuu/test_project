<p>@Reinderien and @vlovero have already told whatever could be done but maybe you would also like the <code>reversed</code> function. Also you do not need to <code>lower()</code> your strings twice when you can do it only once. Strings(immutable type) are passed by value in python and doesn't modify the original string since a shallow copy of your string is sent to the function.</p>
<pre><code>def palindrome(name):

    name = name.lower()

    return "".join(reversed(name)) == name #or simply name[::-1] == name


print(palindrome("Tom"))
print(palindrome("Bob"))
</code></pre>
    </div>

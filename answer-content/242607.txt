<p>Your URL path isn't very RESTlike. You have built the URL to describe an operation when a more common approach is to build the URL to describe a <a href="https://restfulapi.net/resource-naming/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">resource</a>.</p>

<p>So instead of <code>https://example.com/api/mappings/get-by-id/42</code> one would build a URL like <code>https://example.com/api/mappings/42</code>.</p>

<p>The name <code>get-by-id</code> is fully redundant in REST world as the "get" operation is already defined in the HTTP GET-method (the <code>@GetMapping</code> annotation in Spring Boot) and identifying resources by their identifier is always the default operation :).</p>

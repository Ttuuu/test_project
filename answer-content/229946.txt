<h2>Encapsulating the wrong things</h2>

<p><code>insert</code> and <code>flatten</code> should be methods on <code>TreeNode</code>. <code>Solution</code> doesn't particularly need to exist as a class. Those two methods can assume that <code>self</code> is the root.</p>

<h2>Return types</h2>

<p>As @Carcigenicate suggested: what do you return from <code>flatten</code>? Probably the return type hint should be changed to <code>TreeNode</code>, and you should modify your comment to describe the circumstances under which <code>None</code> will or won't be returned.</p>

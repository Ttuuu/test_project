<ul>
<li><p><code>chooseNextWord</code> distorts the probabilities.</p>

<p>For example, consider a list of 3 words with the inherent probabilities <span class="math-container">\$\frac{1}{3}\$</span>, <span class="math-container">\$\frac{1}{3}\$</span>, <span class="math-container">\$\frac{1}{3}\$</span>. The first word is selected with the probability <span class="math-container">\$\frac{1}{3}\$</span>. The second, however is selected with probability <span class="math-container">\$\frac{2}{9}\$</span> (<span class="math-container">\$\frac{2}{3}\$</span> that the first word was <em>not</em> selected, times <span class="math-container">\$\frac{1}{3}\$</span> that it <em>is</em> selected in the second round). The third one has <span class="math-container">\$1 - \frac{1}{3} - \frac{2}{9} = \frac{4}{9}\$</span> chance.</p>

<p>A standard approach is to compute an accumulated sums of probabilities (in the constructor), then to choose a word roll once, and search for a value just above the rolled one.</p></li>
<li><p>The code <em>may</em> benefit from using <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict" rel="noreferrer"><code>defaultdict</code></a> rather than a plain dictionaries. Lesser <code>if</code>s is better.</p></li>
<li><p>Nitpicking. You may want to account for possible typos, such as a space between a word and a terminating punctuation.</p></li>

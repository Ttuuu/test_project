<p>Just for fun I tried implementing this using just generators and the <code>itertools</code>. Using this has the advantage that you don't have to pay the price for indexing multiple times (like in your code), but also not the price for copying the slices (like in <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/100620/ajneufeld">@AJNeufeld</a>'s <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/231502/98493">solution</a>). It also means that instead of using an array, this function can deal with <code>A</code> being a generator (but of course in that case you could not make multiple queries on the same array).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>To get the range from the array, we can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.islice" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>itertools.islice</code></a>, which works similarly to normal slicing (but without indexing from the end, because generators can be infinite).</p></li>
<li><p>Finding the difference between elements is straight-forward when iterating over pairs of elements, which you can get with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.tee" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>itertools.tee</code></a> and advancing one of the resulting iterators.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, we need to run-length-encode the result and find the largest one where the chain of differences is the given difference. For this we can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.groupby" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>itertools.groupby</code></a>.</p></li>
</ul>



<pre><code>def graipher(array, left, right, difference):
    if left == right:
        return 1
    it = islice(iter(array), left - 1, right + 1)
    it1, it2 = tee(it)
    next(it1)
    differences = (a - b for a, b in zip(it1, it2))
    rle = (len(list(g)) for d, g in groupby(differences) if d == difference)
    try:
        return max(rle) + 1
    except ValueError:
        # empty sequence, none of the differences is correct
        return 1
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I put this code into a function that returns the result, instead of printing it. This makes it reusable, and testable. When doing the same to the other solutions, we can even compare the performance using some random test data:</p>

<p>For small slices (<code>R - L</code> small) this generator approach is the slowest of the three approaches, whereas for larger slices it is the second fastest. AJNeufeld's approach is consistently the fastest, tested up to <span class="math-container">\$10^6\$</span> in slice length, which is a magnitude larger than the constraints given in the problem description.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, all three solutions use inherently the same algorithm, iterating through all elements in the slice, and therefore have the same asymptotic behavior.</p>

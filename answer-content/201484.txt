<p>Nice solution, please find a few thoughts below:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Do you need to wrap it in class for leetcode? It's unnecessary otherwise.</p></li>
<li><p>Function names use <code>snake_case</code> and not <code>camelCase</code>, check <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="noreferrer">PEP8</a> for more details. Hence it would be <code>length_of_longest_substring</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not use <code>dict</code> as a variable name, it is already built-in to construct dictionaries.</p></li>
<li><p>I think a for-loop would be preferable over a while-loop in this case, it's more straightforward, less clunky, and easier to understand.</p></li>
<li><p>You update <code>curr_length</code>, but never actually use it to determine your <code>max_length</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The docstring should come right after the <code>class Solution</code> and before the first function, and no line should be longer than 79 characters. Moreover, you seem to not have pasted the entire docstrings, it just ends mid-sentence.</p></li>
</ol>

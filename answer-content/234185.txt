<p>Most has already been said by Nigel Ren. However, your questions about performance issues and overhead remain unanswered.</p>

<p>Using a label comes with very little overhead, so you really don't need to worry that it will impact the performance of your code. </p>

<p>PHP first parses your code into <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/tokens.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tokens</a> and then compiles these into <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/internals2.opcodes.list.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">opcodes</a>. These opcodes are stored in memory and executed. Since your labels don't actually do anything, they don't require memory storage or execution time.</p>

<p>That being said: I really dislike what you do with these labels. If I didn't know why you used them, I would be wondering why they are there. If I had to work on your code I would have the additional worry that any of the labels might be used somewhere in your code. So if I wanted to remove one, because it doesn't seem to serve any purpose, I would have to first check all of the code for references to this label. I would therefore strongly recommend to <em>use language elements only for their intended purpose</em>.</p>

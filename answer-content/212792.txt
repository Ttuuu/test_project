<p>I would try removing the variable length shift, which may be an expensive operation:</p>

<p>So </p>

<pre><code> int i=0, mask = 1;
 for (; i &lt; sizeof(float) * 8; ++i) 
 {
   buffer[startIndex + i] = ( mask &amp; fl) != 0 ? 255 : 0;
   mask &lt;&lt;= 1;
 }
</code></pre>

<p>That might run faster or slower ( hard to predict which ).</p>

<p>I think you should state the eventual goal and context as well, this appears to be a doubtful way of approaching a problem, so the solution may lie in changing the approach.</p>

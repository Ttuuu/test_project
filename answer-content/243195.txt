<p>I think it actually is valid.</p>

<p>Here's all of the possible states of the two mutexes.</p>

<pre><code>/* u: unlocked, s: shared locked, g: upgrade locked, x: exclusive locked
   (state): of which upgrade_mutex state, the states are as this line
   (inter-state): in the middle of these transitions, the states might be as this line
                  Xab means the original state is of symbol X,
                      and the thread is doing the lock/unlock of a-&gt;b
   symbol xmutex smutex (state) (inter-state)

<li>The 10 lock/unlock methods all behave reasonably good in all of the states</li>
<li>Given the prior-method state is in the set, the during-/post-method state is in the set</li>

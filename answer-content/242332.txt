<p>This is a small program, so some of the problems are not likely that big. If this were part of the API, problems may stack up and then make an actual difference. </p>

<p>There are several points which you should work on:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>opendir</code> leak: <code>opendir</code> opens a file descriptor. You open 2 directories, none of which are closed. Make sure to call <code>closedir</code>. If this is part of an API, those memory leaks will stack up. Otherwise, this might not be a problem, since when the process ends, the descriptors should be cleared automatically.</li>
<li>Error checks: If I were to run this code a lot of times, some of which are intended to end in errors, there would be some clatter due to the positioning of your error checks. Checks like <em>does src exist</em> or <em>can dst dir be accessed</em>, should be done first. This will eliminate the need for some operations. Generally, it is always best to perform error checks first. </li>
<li>Finding the name: A big part of the code is dedicated to finding the name of the <code>src</code>, and copying it to <code>dst</code>. You might improve it by using built-in functions instead. Use <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/strrchr-function-in-c-c/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>strrchr</code></a> to find the last <code>/</code> and <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_strcpy.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>strcpy</code></a> to copy the name.</li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe there are other possible changes, but that should be the gist of it. Most of those problems have a small effect. This is a small program, so you won't notice must performance changes (unless this is an API).</p>

<p>besides removal of duplication, there are other issues, more important IMO, that need addressing:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Using Exceptions as control flow is considered an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern" rel="nofollow noreferrer">anti pattern</a>. There are several reasons for this, they are outlined <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/189222/are-exceptions-as-control-flow-considered-a-serious-antipattern-if-so-why">here</a>. in your case, an added reason is that the <code>insert</code> is only needed for the first time for every key. the proper way to do it is to try to select and when you get no data, do an insert. this way, the decision to insert is done in an <code>if</code> statement, and after the 2nd time, there will be no redundant access to the DB. </p></li>
<li><p>naming convention: in Java (as well as several other languages) there is a naming convention for method that dictates that prefix <code>getXxx()</code> means the method retrieves information and does not modify it. your methods break the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment" rel="nofollow noreferrer">principle of least surprise</a>. if the caller of these methods is not aware of the implementation, it will not expect changes to DB after calling them.</p></li>

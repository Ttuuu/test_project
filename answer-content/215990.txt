<p>You could use rumael.yaml, it can preserve comments. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7255885/save-dump-a-yaml-file-with-comments-in-pyyaml#27103244">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7255885/save-dump-a-yaml-file-with-comments-in-pyyaml#27103244</a></p>

<p>Moreover, you want to be a better python developer (or maybe pythonist?) I can give you some tips:</p>

<p><strong>Content duplication</strong>
You are storing the file content inside <code>cont</code> and after closing the file you are duplicating that info in a new variable <code>newfile</code> I think that is an unnecessary process in this situation. You could store all the data in <code>cont</code> and just modify the lines needed. You can replace the entire if-else by:</p>

<pre><code>    if temp != (refnum+1):              
        temp= (refnum+1)       
        change=numRegex.sub(str(temp), cont[i])
        cont[i] = change
</code></pre>

<p><strong>For loop's range</strong>
Change your range call in the for loop to <code>range(2, len(cont)):</code>
Now inside the loop you can access the current line with simply <code>cont[i]</code> it's more readable and efficient.</p>

<p>As with <code>i</code>'s range you are accessing refnum always with a +1. By initializing it as <code>refnum=int(act.group()) +1</code> your code saves that operations inside the loop. Another thing that you can do is do the +=1 increment at the beginning of the loop.</p>

<p><strong>File management</strong>
You don't need to manually close files when using <code>with</code> statement you can remove <code>finalfile.close()</code>. Another thing, you are using <code>with</code> in the when writing but not when reading, think about always use the same method.</p>

<p>More things can be changed but I think that's enough for now.</p>

<p>You're right. Don't write your own <code>exit</code>. Since <code>exit</code> itself generates an exception to terminate the program, simply put your <code>_syslog</code> call in a <code>finally</code> at the top level.</p>

<pre><code>with urllib.request.urlopen
</code></pre>

<p>Unless you have a really good (and obscure) reason, never use <code>urllib</code>. Use <code>requests</code>. It's saner in every way.</p>

<pre><code>if data in ['1', '2']:
</code></pre>

<p>Technically, since you're testing membership, make this a set:</p>

<pre><code>if data in {'1', '2'}:
</code></pre>

<p>As for this function documentation:</p>

<pre><code># Check if the DNS entry for a given hostname differs from current IP,
# and if it has no A record or it differs, return "True". Otherwise,
# return False, and assume the IP address doesn't differ.
</code></pre>

<p>Fine... but this doesn't do what you say it does. It returns strings, not booleans. I'd offer that neither is appropriate, and that you should be returning an enum instead.</p>

<pre><code>    if len(zone) &lt; 1:
        raise LookupError
    else:
        zone_id = zone[0]['id']
</code></pre>

<p>Get rid of the <code>else</code>; you've previously raised.</p>

<p>Apart from mentioned by @Roland, I don't like the infinite loop.
If you think about it, player plays multiple games until he wants to finish, each game made of 20 moves.</p>

<p>To me that sounds something like:</p>

<pre><code>while(wants_to_play):

    # setup new game
    for question_index in range(20):
        # process single question

    # ask if he wants to play another and set wants_to_play accordingly
</code></pre>
    </div>

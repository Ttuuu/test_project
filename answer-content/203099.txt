<p>Regardless of your algorithm, you can simplify it much more with a simple if or switch.</p>

<pre><code>int years = leapyear%4;
switch( years ) {
  case 0: 
    println("Yeeees!");
    break;
  case 1:
    println("1 year later there is a leapyear.");
    break;
  default:
    println((4-years)+" years later there is a leapyear.");
    break;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But I doubt that this is a good practising exercise:</p>

<p>Do you have an unit test for it ? If you had to create one, how could you test the result since it is printed to the console.</p>

<p>How could you improve this code to make it testable and extendable. What could you do if I want to print another message ?</p>

<p>Lots of good answers, just an additional note:</p>

<p>The <code>string</code> type from CS50 is considered bad practice and should never be used. This is because it expands to <code>typedef char* string;</code>. Hiding a pointer behind a typedef like this is bad practice. In addition, there is a type in C++ called <code>string</code>, so using that identifier turns the code mighty confusing.</p>

<p>For this reason alone, CS50 has earned a bad reputation among professional C programmers.</p>

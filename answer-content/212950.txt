<p>If I was evaluating this code as a sample for an interview, I might be deterred by the inconsistent indentation - some blocks are indented with two spaces while others have four spaces. I do like the usage of templates and promises.</p>

<p>One suggestion I have would be to consider eliminating the extra lambda function when starting the application:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>usersColl.fetch().then(function(){
    app.start();
});
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>And use a reference to the start method as the promise callback:</p>

<pre><code>usersColl.fetch().then(app.start);
</code></pre>

<p>This may complicate matters because the method would receive as arguments any parameters returned from the promise. If that becomes an issue, maybe a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind#Partially_applied_functions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">partially bound function</a> would help.</p>

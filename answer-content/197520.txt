<p>I'd like to mention, that there is a special way of making output files in scrapy - <a href="https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/item-pipeline.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">item pipelines</a>. So, in order to make it right, you should write your own pipeline (or modify standard one via subclassing).</p>

<p>Also, you does not close the file, once you're done and you keep it open most of the time. The both problems are handled nicely with pipelines. </p>

<p><strong>UPD</strong>: Well, you've asked for a better way, there it is. Although, if it's not acceptable for some hard-to-explain reasons (it's understandable), here's the other approach, how to make it better. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Don't leave the file open. There is a method (<code>__del__()</code>) which destroys the spider object. Add the code to close the file before it. </p></li>
<li><p>Another one is to store only the filename in the variable and open / close the file each time you write into it. </p></li>
<li><p>Another option is to use NoSQL database, which does not need to be opened / closed. And after scraping is done - get the output file from it. </p></li>
<li><p>If you have a few values to scrape you can store it in object variable, and then export it before <code>__del__()</code> method. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>All the ways above are <strong>NOT</strong> welcomed by the actual developer community and may lead to serious <strong>problem in future</strong>. Use them <em>carefully</em>. Sometimes it's easier (in the long run) to read and understand how it <em>really</em> should be done. </p>

<p>Maybe it's the exact case? </p>

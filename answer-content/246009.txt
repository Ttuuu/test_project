<p>Don't put everything in a single function. That makes your code difficult to maintain and reuse, even by yourself. The ideal function size is so small that one can no longer reasonably extract further functions from it. In your code, each program is just one function, quite the opposite of the ideal.</p>
<p>All resources should be handled with <code>try</code>-with-resources constructs, not only the <code>fileChannel</code>.</p>
<p>It is not possible for a reviewer to run your program without changing it first, because you use an absolute, operating-system-specific and user-specific path in your program: <code>Path.of("C:\\Users\\Emman\\" + fileName + ".txt")</code>.</p>
<p>If you're serious about learning network programming, you may want to do some sanitation to <code>fileName</code>. What if it contains <code>..</code>? What if somebody sends <code>..\..\WINNT\explorer.exe</code> or something like that as filename?</p>
<p>The way how your program is written, <code>isAvailable</code> can and should be a local variable. In general, having non-<code>final</code> <code>static</code> variables is considered bad design. It prevents multiple instances of your class to function independently in parallel.</p>

<p>Why would you want to use Regular Expressions anyway if the base format of the string is always the same?</p>

<p><code>Name[Number]</code> seems like an easy pattern. Just iterate through the characters one by one and store all characters in the first string until you reach the first bracket. Then store the numbers in the second string (until you reach the closing bracket). Getting rid of the Regular Expression should make it faster.</p>

<p>The most concise way to write your function that's still very readable is this:</p>

<pre><code>function isNodeModified(node: Node, event?: Event): boolean {
  return Math.abs((event ? event.value : node.originalWeight) - node.currentWeight) &gt; this.EPSILON;
}
</code></pre>

<p>If <code>event</code> is passed in, the <code>event</code>'s <code>value</code> is used, otherwise <code>node</code>'s <code>originalWeight</code> is used.</p>

<p>Ternary operators are amazing for condensing simple checks/if-statements into an inline operation. I recommend using them as much as possible as long as the result is still readable and not lengthy.</p>

<p>First, <code>logrotate</code> is a tool built to do exactly this sort of thing. I would recommend using that to achieve the effectively the same extremely reliably and with lots of configuration options. That said, some suggestions on the code as written:</p>

<ul>
<li>ShellCheck is great; I would recommend following its recommendation to use <code>(( i++ ))</code>.</li>
<li><code>wc -l</code> counts the number of <em>lines,</em> not bytes or kilobytes, which seems to be what you want.</li>
<li><code>old</code>, <code>minus</code> and <code>i</code> are not helpful names; I have to read and understand all the code in the context in order to understand what they mean.</li>
<li>It looks like you only ever replace the <em>last</em> of the 20 files once you have 20 backups.</li>
<li>You have five instances of <code>~/.bash_history</code>, even though one of them is the value of a variable. I would pull that variable out and reuse it everywhere.</li>
<li><a href="https://mywiki.wooledge.org/Quotes" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Use More Quotesâ„¢</a> - it's good for you and the code.</li>
<li>Rather than a special unnumbered backup file (~/.bash_history.old), why not just start numbering the backups immediately? That way you can get rid of at least two checks for whether that file exists (<code>[[ ! -e ~/.bash_history.old ]]</code> and its inverse, <code>[[ -e $name$old ]]</code>).</li>
</ul>

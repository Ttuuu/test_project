<h2>Modules instead of "namespace" classes</h2>

<p><code>TreeSortingAlgorithms</code> has no right to exist. It's good to want to put stuff in namespaces, but your nested classes are confusing and difficult-to-read. Instead, just put your algorithmic classes into a different file and use it as a module. That will get you a namespace but also be more legible, easier to deal with in source control, etc.</p>

<p>Also, be careful:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This super class has two subclasses of HeapSort and BinarySort.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most people would interpret that as <code>HeapSort</code> being a child or derivation of <code>TreeSortingAlgorithms</code>, which is not the case. This is not a superclass/subclass relationship, but rather a nested class relationship.</p>

<h2>Terminology</h2>

<pre><code>            # Increments
            heap_index -= 1
</code></pre>

<p>That's not an increment, it's a decrement.</p>

<h2>Loop like a native</h2>

<pre><code>        while heap_index &gt;= 1:
            # Restores down the element
            TreeSortingAlgorithms.HeapSort.restore_down(
                heap_index, input_list, input_size)
            # Increments
            heap_index -= 1
</code></pre>

<p>should be something like</p>

<pre><code>starting_index = heap_index
for heap_index in range(starting_index, 0, -1):
   # ...
</code></pre>

<h2>Useful comments</h2>

<pre><code># Assigns the left and right child indices
</code></pre>

<p>This is worse than not having a comment at all. If you're near-verbatim rewriting Python into English, it's time to delete the comment or write something useful, e.g.</p>

<pre><code># The left index starts at double the heap index because (algorithmic explanation)
</code></pre>

<h2>English is not C</h2>

<p>This isn't my first review of your code, and you need to change this (again). Stop writing semicolons at the end of your comments.</p>

<h2>Real tests</h2>

<p>It's great that you've written some test code. To make it useful, you should add some <code>assert</code>s that test the output of your code against known expected outputs.</p>

<h2>Unicode symbols</h2>

<p>Your apples are hilarious. Keep them, but I think that they may present problems if ever you have team-shared code across a wide variety of platforms and editors. Consider something like this instead:</p>

<pre><code>GREEN_APPLE = '\U0001F34F'

# ...

print(f'{GREEN_APPLE} Heap Sort Test {test_heap_index + 1} was successful!')
</code></pre>

<p>When something is difficult in Java it's nearly always because there is a better way to do it (in Java, it generally means you are missing a class).  In your case, it looks like you need a "Subject" class.</p>

<p>Let's say you had a "Subject" class, how would it be implemented? Here's one way (Not my favorite)</p>

<pre><code>enum Subject {
    Accounts(1,1),
    English(1,2),
    â€¦;
   public static Subject getSubject(streamId, subjectId) {
       // Iterate over Subject.values and return one that matches
   }
</code></pre>

<p>This means that your call becomes simple:</p>

<pre><code>assertEquals(Subjects.Accounts, Subject.getSubject(1,1));
</code></pre>

<p>I don't completely love this because it's still hard-coded.  I would personally make the Subjects class a full class and load it from either a database or a data file, but it should still have a getSubject() static.    </p>

<p>Just in case you think there is some kind of performance issue caused by looping instead of a switch, note that A) java is 10x faster than python to start and B) premature optimization is the root of all evil (well, lots of evil)</p>

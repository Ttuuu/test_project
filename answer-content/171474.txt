<p>I've implemented a few social apps before.  What you've done is pretty standard practice when it comes to oauth authentication and is secure.</p>

<p>The one thing you could change:</p>

<pre><code> where(id: fb_user.id).first_or_create do |user|
   user.name = fb_user.name
 end
</code></pre>

<p>When you use <code>first_or_create</code> when it creates it'll set the where query as attributes.  So in your case the id will already be set as <code>fb_user.id</code>.</p>

<p>In general, you shouldn't expose synchronous operations as asynchronous, see <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/pfxteam/archive/2012/03/24/10287244.aspx" rel="nofollow"><em>Should I expose asynchronous wrappers for synchronous methods?</em></a> If a method doesn't have an async version, just expose it synchronously. The caller can then choose to run it on another thread, if that makes sense.</p>

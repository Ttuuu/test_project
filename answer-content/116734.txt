<p>Do you really have a good reason for this permission setup?</p>

<pre><code>RUN chmod 777 /root/startup.sh
</code></pre>

<p>It's a bit ironic to use the <code>-v</code> flag of <code>tar</code>, and then redirecting the output to <code>/dev/null</code> here:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>RUN tar -xvzf httpd-2.4.18.tar.gz &gt;/dev/null
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>You can drop that flag and the redirection, the outcome should be the same.</p>

<p>I'm not very familiar with Docker, but I'm wondering what will happen if any of the commands fail. For example, if <code>make</code> fails, you probably don't want to run the <code>make install</code> command that follows it.
I don't have a solution for that, but error handling is something to think about.</p>

<p>The repetitive redirections and duplicated strings don't look pretty, and look hard to maintain. There gotta be a better way. Perhaps you could put the shell commands into a proper <code>.bash</code> script, enjoy all the power of regular bash scripting (variables, functions), and in the docker file just fetch that script using <code>wget</code>, and then execute it.</p>

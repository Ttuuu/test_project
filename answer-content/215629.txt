<p>There is a lot going on here but I will focus on 3 specific problems that I find most glaring in your example, readability, DRY and redundancy.</p>

<p><strong>Readability:</strong></p>

<p>Code should be as easy to read as possible, complexity should be avoided as much as one can. Code that is hard to read is hard to change and we always need to change the code sooner or later. </p>

<p>Naming variables is important, using single character variable names is just confusing.</p>

<p><strong>DRY</strong></p>

<p>Don't repeat yourself. Repetitive coding practises that crams in a lot of duplicate code in multiple places.</p>

<p><strong>Redundancy</strong></p>

<p>Code that is unnecessary </p>

<p><strong>Changes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Rename <code>$a</code> variable to something more appropriate, <code>$data</code> for instance (Readability)</li>
<li>Move <code>UpdateStocks::getQuoteParams()</code> into the <code>foreach</code>, remove the <code>$i</code> variable (Redundancy)</li>
<li>Remove the <code>$k</code> variable inside the <code>foreach</code> (Redundancy)</li>
<li>Inverse the isset/empty condition so you don't need to wrap the whole code segment into it (Readability)</li>
<li>Rename the <code>$p</code> variable to <code>$parameters</code> (Readability)</li>
<li>Simplify array parameter, use <code>$id</code> in place of <code>$parameter["id"]</code> (Readability)</li>
<li>While <code>preg_match</code> is usable, since you only use the first 2 characters in this particular case you can use <code>substr</code> instead, it is easier on the eyes (Readability)</li>
<li>Rename <code>$hs</code> variable to something more suitable like <code>$html</code> (Readability)</li>
<li>Move up/down code that is repeated in each if/else (DRY)</li>
<li>Use <code>$lb</code> instead of <code>$parameter["lb"]</code> (Readability)</li>
<li>Remove the <code>$h</code> variable altogether, not necessary (Redundancy)</li>
<li>Replace if/elseif/elseif.../else with a switch statement (Readability)</li>
<li>Define variables close to where they are used, move <code>$bt</code> to the bottom (Readability)</li>
</ul>

<p>I made a gif just showing you en example refactoring of your code, it's about 10 minutes. </p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Don't copy the code straight up, it has not been tested, has made up mock data and a few changes to it so I could run it(changed date for example). It is just an example, you have been warned. :-)</p>

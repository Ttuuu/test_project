<ul>
<li>Mark variables that will remain constant as <code>const</code>.</li>
<li>Initialise variables right away when they're created, if possible. You're just adding one extra line with no benefit.</li>
<li>Limit the scope of variables by creating them only when they're required, not at the top. They'll go unused in certain conditions. Also one won't have to sanity check the whole function to see if the variable has been modified since it was created.</li>
<li>Use a more descriptive function name. <code>del_node_at_index</code> is even better.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Readability and ease of use</strong></p>

<p>I think the calculator should have simple functions : plus, minus, divide, multiple and use the strategy within the calculator. </p>

<p><strong>State</strong></p>

<p>You are setting the operation by a state in the calculator. Change state can lead to weird bugs.</p>

<p>For example what will happen if you call calculator.Calculate without calling setCalculationStategy?</p>

<p><strong>Singleton</strong></p>

<p>I don't understand why the calculator is a singleton? What are the benefits? </p>

<p>Think what will happen if you use it with multiple threads. </p>

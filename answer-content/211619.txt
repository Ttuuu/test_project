<p>Not really a review question. But as this will be closed I might as well give a quick answer. You should have asked this at SO.</p>

<p><code>switch</code> statement are meant as a shortcut to long lists of simple <code>if (a == 1) else if (a == 2) else if (...</code>. They ended up in JS as that is what was needed to attract C/C++ coders to the language back in the day when JS was SLOW.</p>

<p>There is nothing wrong with using them but in most cases you can simplify with <code>if else</code>.</p>

<p>EG</p>

<pre><code>// 3 logic operations
if (a &gt;= 75) {   // 1
   if (a &lt; 100) { ... } // 2 
   else if (a &lt; 150) {/* 3 logic operations to get here */}  // 3
}

// 8 logic operations
switch (true) {  // this must evaluate on each case === true if you get to them
  case (a &gt;= 75 &amp;&amp; a &lt; 100): //  1:(a &gt;= 75)  2:(a &lt; 100) 3:(&amp;&amp;) 4:(case === true)
    ...
    break;
  case (a &gt;= 100 &amp;&amp; a &lt; 150): //  5:(a &gt;= 100)  6:(a &lt; 150) 7:(&amp;&amp;) 8:(case === true)
    /* 8 logic operations to get here */
    break;
</code></pre>

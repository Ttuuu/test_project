<p>While memoization can result in impressive performance improvements, it's not really appropriate for this task, when a trivial loop would do what you want</p>

<pre><code>def fib(n):
    res = [0, 1]
    if n &lt; 2:
        return res[0:n]
    for i in range(2, n):
        res.append(res[i - 1] + res[i - 2])

    return res
</code></pre>

<p>But the answers all depend on the problem domain. This is linear and has no memory overhead. The memoised ones have memory overhead but if you're repeatedly generating fibonacci sequences, would eventually have improved performance.</p>

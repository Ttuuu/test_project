<h1>Readability</h1>
<p>Break the code up into multiple functions, that each do their own small task. The main loop should read like:</p>
<pre><code>for player in itertools.cycle(players):
     spot = pick_spot(board)
     place_mark(board, player, spot)
     print(board)

     if (check_win_condition(board)):
         print(f"{player} wins!")
         break
     elif (check_tie_condition(board)):
         print("Tie game.")
         break
</code></pre>
<h1>Simplicity</h1>
<p>Yes, <code>stars</code> is clunky, but also unnecessary. Keep it simple, and just don't print stars around error messages! If you want to make an error message stand out, just start the line with the text <code>ERROR:</code>.</p>
<h1>Idiomatic code</h1>
<p>It looks quite idiomatic to me. You're leaning heavily on NumPy, so it's more idiomatic NumPy code than pure Python code I would say.</p>
<h1>Combine <code>numbered_positions</code> and <code>board</code></h1>
<p>Why not have <code>numbered_positions</code> be the initial <code>board</code>, and every time a player moves, you replace a number by <code>X</code> or <code>O</code>? This removes a variable and makes printing the board easier, although it would make checking for a tie game a little more complex.</p>

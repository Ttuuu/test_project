<p>You can approach this in a cleaner manner by using the filter function; for example:</p>

<pre><code>stri = input("Give me a phrase:")
# Filter will return every character in stri x, where x.isupper() returns true
stri_up = filter(str.isupper, stri)  
# Filter returns an iterator, to get the length we cast to a list first
up_count = len(list(stri_up))  
stri_lo = filter(str.islower, stri)
lo_count = len(list(stri_lo))
print("The number of uppercase letters in your phrase is:", up_count)
print("The number of lowercase letters in your phrase is:", lo_count)
</code></pre>

<p>As a note this is a less efficient approach, since you iterate through the string twice in the filter calls, but it is a different way of approaching the problem, and hopefully get you introduced to some more advanced python techniques. </p>

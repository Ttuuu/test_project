<p>If you sometimes want a bool and sometime you want a list of properties and values I would suggest changing so you return an IEnumerable of type <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.dataannotations.validationresult(v=vs.110).aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ValidationResult</a></p>

<p>IF you change your method to use yield returns when you want a bool you can just use the Linq Any() method and it will stop after finding the first one.  Using IEnumerable you are not limited to 3 properties like in your class you built.  </p>

<p>I agree with everything Adriano Repetti posted and instead of returning false you could just yield return a ValidationResult class with the information you need. </p>

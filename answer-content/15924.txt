<p>The date/time functions in PHP are a tricky thing. Last I looked into this there were known bugs with many of the date/time functions, especially around leap years, but no solutions. I don't know if that has changed, haven't had the need to look, so this answer might not be the best one, but have you tried <code>strtotime()</code>?</p>

<pre><code>$period = 30;//90 for 3 months, 180 for 6 months

$until = strtotime( 'now' );
$from = strtotime( "-$period days" );
//or
$period = 'last month';//'last 3 months', or 'last 6 months'
$from = strtotime( $period );
</code></pre>

<p>I've not tried any of the above, but I'm fairly confident the first half should work, but I'm not sure about the last half. However, <code>strtotime()</code> is a pretty smart function, so who knows. Hope it helps.</p>

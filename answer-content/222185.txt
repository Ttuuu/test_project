<p>By performing recursion, you are performing a depth-first search of four-letter words. However, this task involves finding a shortest path, and shortest-path problems are generally better done using breadth-first search. With BFS, the first solution you encounter will be an optimal solution â€” which is not the case with DFS.</p>

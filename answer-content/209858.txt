<p>Disclaimer: I'm not familiar with <code>openpyxl</code>. I hope this review won't be nonsense. Do tell me!</p>

<p>The posted code copies the content of the first sheet into <code>data</code>,
writes inverted (transposed?) content into a new sheet <code>tmp_sheet</code>,
copies attributes of the original sheet to <code>tmp_sheet</code>
and finally deletes the original sheet.</p>

<p>What I don't get is why not update the original sheet directly?
You could loop over coordinates of the cells below the diagonal of the sheet,
compute the coordinates of the cell to swap with,
use a suitable temporary storage for swapping single values.
The diagonal can be left alone, they don't need to be swapped with anything.</p>

<p>This approach would have the advantages that if there are multiple sheets in the file,
the content of the first sheet stays on the first sheet,
and you don't need to worry about copying properties of the sheet such as the title.</p>

<h3>Why so many aliases?</h3>

<pre><code>    ll = b

    rem_part1 = rem

    rem_part2 = l

    l = rem_part1
</code></pre>

<p>Why do you continually assign <code>x = y</code>? Why don't you just keep each value in a single variable?</p>

<h3>Why so many un-descriptive looking names?</h3>

<pre><code>ll = int
bb = int
</code></pre>

<p>Also to be underlined <code>ll</code> that is <code>LETTER L LETTER L</code> looks really similar to <code>11</code> in some fonts that is <code>NUMBER ONE NUMBER ONE</code> especially at small font-sizes making it even more confusing to read the code.</p>

<pre><code>rem = bb - b
</code></pre>

<p>This name is misleading <code>rem</code> stands for remainder, that is the result of division: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remainder" rel="nofollow noreferrer">from Wikipedia</a> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In arithmetic, the remainder is the integer "left over" after dividing one integer by another to produce an integer quotient (integer division).</p>

<h3>Why is <code>count</code> global?</h3>

<p>The <code>count</code> variable should be defined inside the function and <code>return</code>ed out. While it does not really matter in such a small program, <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/148108/why-is-global-state-so-evil">avoiding global variables is a good habit</a>.</p>

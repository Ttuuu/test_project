<h2>Exceptions</h2>

<pre><code># Not sure how to design and handle the exceptions here yet
</code></pre>

<p>Your syntax is more or less fine, though you'll obviously want to rename the exception class. The purpose of an exception like this is to allow you to <code>raise</code> something specific to your application that consumer code might be interested in catching. One place you could potentially raise:</p>

<pre><code>    if parent is None:
        return
</code></pre>

<p>It's unlikely that silent-fail is the right thing to do, here.</p>

<h2><code>is None</code></h2>

<p>This:</p>

<pre><code>return self.root == None
</code></pre>

<p>should probably be</p>

<pre><code>return self.root is None
</code></pre>

<h2>Member types</h2>

<p>These assignments:</p>

<pre><code>    self.right_child = None
    self.left_child = None
</code></pre>

<p>should receive type hints, since it's not obvious what they'll eventually receive. My guess is</p>

<pre><code>self.right_child: Node = None
self.left_child: Node = None
</code></pre>

<h2>English is not C;</h2>

<p>You have a funny habit of terminating your comments with semicolons. That isn't necessary.</p>

<h2>Node value types</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>node_value</code> (Node Value): Must be an integer/float</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So which is it - an integer, or a float? Given that your usage of this value only requires that it be comparable, I'd suggest <code>float</code>.</p>

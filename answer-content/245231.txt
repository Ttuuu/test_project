<p>In FlowPass you have a long sequence of if .. {} .. else if {} statements.</p>
<p>I suggest trying a lookup table to compute the value, say</p>
<pre><code>  node.Flow.Value = Lookup [ (comparisonX+1)*3 + (comparisonY+1) ]
</code></pre>
<p>where Lookup is initialised as</p>
<pre><code>int [] Lookup = new int[] { 3, ... }
</code></pre>
<p>It may even be possible to compute this with a simple arithmetic expression, although I cannot immediately see an expression that works. From the code supplied I am not clear how  Flow.Value is used, it may be possible to choose a different encoding which is simpler and faster to calculate.</p>

<p>This is okay for as a start. However you are missing the two classes Bus and Ambulance.</p>

<p>Few comments:</p>

<p>(1) You are using this._variableName pattern - although not wrong this is a bit redundant way to express yourself. Historically <code>_variableName</code> or m_variableName comes from C++ to indicate member variables. However, <code>this.variableName</code> already means that this is a member variable hence the "_" is redundant.</p>

<p>(2) The key to good design is consistency. Therefore it would make sense if all of your methods return status string or none but the status() method. Choose and stay consistent. Your current methods are all over the place.</p>

<p>(3) You are missing implementation on few of the methods like accelerate(), turnLeft() and turnRight(); </p>

<p>Implement those changes and let's resume the code review.</p>

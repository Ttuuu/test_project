<h1>Input</h1>

<pre><code>position = input("Position:")
X = int(position[0])
Y = int(position[2])
direction = position[4]
</code></pre>

<p>This input code is fragile.  It assumes that the input will always be single digit X, Y locations, always separated by exactly 1 character.  If the position is given as <code>12 15 N</code>, the code would fail converting a space to an integer.  Even if that didn’t raise an exception, the X coordinate would be parsed as <code>1</code>, not <code>12</code>, and the direction would be <code>5</code> instead of <code>N</code>.</p>

<p>Instead, you should <code>split()</code> the input into a list of “terms” based on the white space between them, and parse the first term as the <code>X</code> value, the second term as the <code>Y</code> value, and the third term as the <code>direction</code>:</p>

<pre><code>terms = input("Position:").split()
X = int(terms[0])
Y = int(terms[1])
direction = terms[2]
</code></pre>

<h1>PEP-8</h1>

<p>Variables in Python should be lowercase identifiers (<code>snake_case</code>).  The variables and members <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> should be named <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.</p>

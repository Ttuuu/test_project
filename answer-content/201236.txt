<p>I don't understand why you build a coplicated structure with separate $server variables. You have a list of server names with associated services.  </p>

<p>That's a simple list that could be contained in a csv file. If read into a variable object you could iterate through the list without the need of an index.</p>

<p>BTW proper indenting helps reading the code.<br>
There are several unintended line breaks.</p>

<p>In addition to <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/109474/24141">@GeroldBroser</a>'s answer, I'm not sure if the <code>UnitType.NUMERIC</code> <code>enum</code> value is a good fit... The others are really measurements for mass, and thus a unit-less value is probably better represented as a <code>null</code> value.</p>

<p>Also, your <code>-1000</code> return value is an ugly hack to 'ignore' further calculations in <code>getPrice()</code>. You should think of a better way to handle such cases, than using a default number.</p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong></p>

<p>For constructor chaining, the recommended approach is for the stricter (i.e. less arguments) constructor to <em>passthrough</em> default values to the liberal (i.e. more arguments) one. This lets you consolidate all the settings into one method, and also lets you convert to an immutable class implementation afterwards, without the compiler complaining that <code>final</code> fields are not set in the stricter constructors.</p>

<h3>Needs volatile keyword</h3>
<p>The way your program is written, <code>predicate_value</code> needs to be a <code>volatile int</code> instead of a normal <code>int</code>.  This is because you are reading it <strong>without locking the mutex</strong> in <code>main()</code>, and writing to it in <code>do_work()</code> from another thread.</p>
<p>Another way to avoid the problem is to ensure that you only ever read the variable with the mutex locked.</p>

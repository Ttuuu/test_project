<p>When parsing and manipulating dates (or times), you should use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#module-datetime" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>datetime</code></a> module.</p>

<p>It supports both <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.strptime" rel="nofollow noreferrer">parsing strings with a given format</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.strftime" rel="nofollow noreferrer">formatting <code>datetime</code> objects with another given format</a>. The only thing it doesn't support is adding a delimiter between numbers:</p>

<pre><code>import datetime

def date_format(string, old_format, new_format):
    return datetime.strptime(string, old_format).strftime(new_format)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the formats have to comply with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>datetime</code>s format specifiers</a>. In particular that means that instead of <code>"YYYY"</code>, <code>"YYYYMM"</code> and <code>"YYYYMMDD"</code> you would have to use <code>"%Y"</code>, <code>"%Y%m"</code> and <code>"%Y%m%d"</code>, respectively. These format specifiers are not arbitrary, they mostly resemble the ones supported by the corresponding C library (which has existed for quite some time).</p>

<p>So, unless you <em>really</em> need that delimiter, I would use this, because it is vastly simpler and a lot easier to understand (especially by someone else). Even if you need the delimiter, it is probably easier to manipulate the output of this function to include it.</p>

<p>One significant issue that has not been addressed in previous answers (all of which make excellent points), is that of deterministic behaviour.</p>

<p>Your code is going to produce unexpected, and inconsistent results if the data in the sorted array is not unique. You clearly indicate that the array is pre-sorted, but you do not specify any restraints on the uniqueness of the values.</p>

<p>It is standard in search routines to return the index of the <em>first</em> value in the array that matches the search term, but your code will return the index of "some" matching value.</p>

<p>When you find the match, scan backwards to find the first instance..., so your match code would change from:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>if (sortedArray[mid] == key) {
    return mid;
} else if
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>to more like:</p>

<pre><code>if (sortedArray[mid] == key) {
    // Ensure we return the first matching instance in the array.
    while (mid &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; sortedArray[mid -1] == key) {
       mid--;
    }
    return mid;
} else if
</code></pre>

<p>It's always a good idea to decouple low-level code, like the one jQuery is intended for (show a div, a click event) from high-level code (an action about your businness, in this case, the map).</p>

<p>A simple example is: imagine that the logic you have inside that click event callback should be triggered each 5 minutes... Would you fake the click event to execute that logic? Or imagine that this action can be triggered by another button too, what would you do? </p>

<p>Wouldn't it be better to have it in a method like <em>updateRoutes()</em> and inside it, methods like <em>addDefaultOption()</em>, <em>getRouteInfo()</em>...? You should try to structure your code as much as independent from your tools as possible, and jQuery is a tool.</p>

<p>Another good piece of advice would be: find duplications and extract them to variables, functions... and give them a proper name that express their responsibility. </p>

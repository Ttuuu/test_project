<p>I see a few things that may help you improve your program.</p>

<h2>Reconsider the tool</h2>

<p>The <code>graphviz</code> package seems designed for more human-scale output graphics than your project is intending to use.  The problem, as you have discovered, is that the layout does not scale linearly with the number of nodes, so your desire to process more than 10,000 nodes and millions of edges might not be a good match for <code>graphviz</code>, or for human consumption as a single diagram.  Might GIS software such as GRASS or QGIS might be more appropriate for your use?</p>

<h2>Use a different layout engine</h2>

<p>The <code>neato</code> engine has limitations that the <code>sfdp</code> engine does not.  If you change </p>

<pre><code>static const char* fargv[] = {"neato", "-Tsvg"}; // NOLINT
</code></pre>

<p>to this:</p>

<pre><code>static const char* fargv[] = {"sfdp", "-Tsvg"}; // NOLINT
</code></pre>

<p>the layout will be a bit different, but perhaps still acceptable and likely faster.</p>

<h2>Check the fine print</h2>

<p>You may already be aware, but in fact, the <code>dot</code> requires the <a href="http://graphviz.org/doc/info/attrs.html#d:weight" rel="nofollow noreferrer">weights to be integer values</a>.  For the reasons mentioned in the comments of your code, you may not want to change anything anyway, but it's probably useful to be aware of it and maybe also insert a comment saying "yes, I know" if that's the case.</p>

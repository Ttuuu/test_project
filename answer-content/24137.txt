<p>You seem to have too many checks for '\0'. They don't add anything. Also too many brackets, but better too many than too few.</p>

<p>Also, is <code>long long</code> guaranteed to be bigger than <code>int</code>? I don't think it is. Here's another version that doesn't need a bigger representation than that of <code>int</code>: </p>

<pre><code>int atoi(const char *str)
{
    int n = 0;
    int sign = 1;

    while (isspace(*str)) {
        ++str;
    }
    if (*str == '-') {
        sign = -1;
        ++str;
    } else if (*str == '+') {
        sign = 1;
        ++str;
    }
    while (isdigit(*str)) {
        if (n &gt; INT_MAX/10) { /* EDIT: protect against overflow */
            break;
        }
        n *= 10;
        int ch = *str - '0';

        if (n &gt; INT_MAX - ch) {
            break;
        }
        n += ch;
        ++str;
    }
    if (isdigit(*str)) {
        return sign == 1 ? INT_MAX : INT_MIN;
    }
    return sign * n;
}
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: I added a check to prevent overflow of the <code>n *= 10</code></p>

<p>EDIT2: improved to avoid using an unsigned int - it was a hack</p>

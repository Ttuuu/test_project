<p>I would suggest constants be defined for the values of the <code>Manager::phase</code> - e.g.</p>

<pre><code>const PHASE_FROM_DEPLOY_TO_MOVE = -1;
const PHASE_SHIP_MOVES = 0;
const PHASE_FROM_FIREORDERS_TO_RESOLVE_FIRE = 2;
const PHASE_FROM_DAMAGE_CONTROL_TO_NEW_TURN_AND_DEPLOYMENT = 3
</code></pre>

<p>And use those in constant names in place of the values. That way, somebody looking at the logic can have an idea what those values mean - and you don't have to repeat those comments everywhere the value is used...</p>

<hr>

<p>I notice in the sample implementation of <code>handleFiringPhase()</code> that <code>true</code> is returned, but <code>doAdvance()</code> doesn't appear to do anything with the return value. You should re-evaluate the need to return a value. Also, would one of the methods called by that method  ever return <code>false</code> to signify failure or something along those lines?</p>

<hr>

<p>For your implementation of <code>setFireOrderDetails</code> I would suggest using <code>foreach</code> to make the syntax cleaner - I know you are looping in the reverse order so for that, perhaps <code>array_reverse()</code> would suffice?</p>

<p>Bearing in mind that it has been 9 months since you posted this code, have you made any updates to it? If so, were there any updates to the main code you asked the question about (i.e. resolving the fireorder within the scope of the "target")?</p>

<p>Well that's great progress.  I now have some more comments.</p>

<ol>
<li>Brute force rather than precision</li>
</ol>

<p>Your search for highlighted words is using a 'brute force' approach as you are examining every word rather than using the Word search function to search for words with a specific highlight.</p>

<p>2 Multiple variables rather than grouped data</p>

<p>Your are using multiple variables for a set of grouped data.  You can simplify your code by declaring a Type (simple) or object (slightly more complicated).  e.g you could declare a type called 'Scorecard' which has fields of Incorrect, Omitted, Added, Total and Percent.  In fact if I were doing this problem Scorecard would be an object with the searching and summing routines encapsulated in the class.</p>

<ol start="3">
<li>Find total word count comment.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is an example of useless commenting. Sorry to be so rude.  But the comment requires us to know that you have encoded the total words already in the document and that it is the only italicised word on the page.  A much better comment would be to say exactly that.  ' The total word count is located at the foot of the document and is the only italicised word in the document'.  BUT this is also possibly a waste of time because you document structure is not taking advantage of templates.</p>

<ol start="4">
<li>Coding rather than template.</li>
</ol>

<p>You insert the report of the score by creating the text programatically.  This is where words Template system comes to our aid.  A better starting position might be that you have a Template with a Table that contains the report details.  One column for the labels and one column for the scores.  Even if you didn't want or can't use a template I'd still prefer to insert a table as this would make the subsequent programming much easier to follow.</p>

<ol start="5">
<li>Screen updating. </li>
</ol>

<p>You turn it off but never turn it back on again.</p>

<ol start="6">
<li>Unnecessary calculations</li>
</ol>

<p>When you are calculating the totals for each highlight you also update the overall total.  This isn't necessary, you can add the totals for the green, blue and yellow highlights at the end of the loop.</p>

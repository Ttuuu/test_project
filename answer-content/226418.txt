<p>Don't shorten variable names. It's really annoying having to scroll back to the top of the page and read a comment to know what 'kog' or kohg' stands for. The interpreter doesn't care how long variable names are, but humans do.</p>

<p>Use meaningful names. What the heck is <code>H_PARAMATER</code> and <code>A_PARAMATER</code>? 
Most of the time 1 letter variable names are also meaningless, such as <code>z</code>.</p>

<p>Arrays are very useful. No need to have <code>group_a - group_h</code> or <code>pot_1 - pot_4</code> (whatever the heck <code>pot</code> means. This will be a maintenance nightmare.</p>

<p>Your indentation is off in a couple places, such as here:</p>

<pre><code>for group in sorted_groups:
    print(
    "| {:&lt;20} | {:^4} | {:^3} | {:^3} | {:^3} | {:^4} | {:^4} | {:^6} |".format("CLUB", "MP", "W", "D",
                                                                                        "L", "GF",
                                                                                        "GA", "PTS"))
    for team in group:
        print("| {:&lt;20} | {:^4} | {:^3} | {:^3} | {:^3} | {:^4} | {:^4} | {:^6} |".
</code></pre>

<p>Use method names that make sense. <code>penalty_shootout</code> isn't really a method name. All your methods also seem to be doing many things, I suggest creating more methods, each only doing 1 thing.</p>

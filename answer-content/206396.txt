<p>Using guard clauses often makes the code more readable and code is read more often than it is written. Some coding standards are not so happy with multiple return statements, but I would definitely go for readability here. If going for guard clauses fully the code would read</p>

<pre><code>bool IsLeapYear(int year)
{
    if (year % 400 == 0)
        return true;

    if (year % 100 == 0)
        return false;

    if (year % 4 == 0)
        return true;

    return false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I think that is easy to read and understand.</p>

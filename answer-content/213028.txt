<h2>Too long</h2>
<p>That is a lot of code, and I don't have a clue what is should be doing. But then neither does the machine you run it on.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It is full of repeated and redundant code.</p>
<p>Removing comments and whitespaces trimmed 200+ lines.</p>
<p>Compacting code by removing needless line breaks, using ternary operators, using functions to do repeated code, removing switch statement in favour of array lookups, I was down to 600 lines and there was a lot left to cut out.</p>
<p>You basically have more than half the content (1200 lines in the question snippet) that contributes nothing to the functionality. I estimate that the whole thing can be written in less than 400 lines, be easier to read and maintain, and run more efficiently.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don't declare length variables in <code>for</code> loops, that optimization became history a decade ago.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use <code>for of</code> loops in favour of <code>for ; ;</code> loops</p>
</li>
<li><p>Remove useless code. You have labels and variable declarations that are never used.</p>
</li>
<li><p>JavaScript requires semicolons, use them unless you know every edge case where ASI can catch you out. if you don't know what ASI is then use semicolons!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Some bad (evil) coder one day missed the old spaghetti days when <code>goto</code> was all the rage. But <code>goto</code> had such a bad reputation nobody would accept its use anymore. So he came up with <code>continue</code> and <code>labels</code> and thus <code>goto 10</code> became <code>continue label</code></p>
<p><code>continue</code> is a hack, a <code>goto</code> in disguise, a hard to see break in flow. I have written a zillion lines of code and have never needed to use <code>continue</code> or declare a label in released code.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If a function is more than a page long, its too long.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use <code>const</code> for variable that do not (and thus should not) change.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Removing code via comments is a bad habit. Good code does not have any code inside comments. (Granted there is reason during testing and development to temp out code with comments, but when done it should be removed)</p>
</li>
<li><p>JavaScript uses <code>camelCase</code> and if you write JS so should you.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sign that an array is in order. If you have variables named <code>end_arr1</code>, <code>end_arr2</code>, <code>end_arr3</code> it's a sure sign that it should be an array.</p>
<p>The following code</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>data_obj.shared_secret1 = 0
data_obj.shared_secret2 = 0
data_obj.final_swap1 = 0
data_obj.final_swap2 = 0
data_obj.multiple1 = 0
data_obj.multiple2 = 0
data_obj.mac1 = 0
data_obj.mac2 = 0
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>is repeated again and again. So much code can be removed if you used an array and indexed the 1,2</p>

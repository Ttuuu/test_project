<p>This is mostly pretty good. Only a couple of things:</p>

<p>Delete this -</p>

<pre><code>    print(self.input_list)
</code></pre>

<p>You should leave printing to the caller.</p>

<p>Also - why the class at all? This really boils down to a single function. You only have one member variable, and only one method.</p>

<p>There's another issue - this class results in "surprising mutation". Iterating over it modifies one of its members. This is another argument for a simple function. If you keep the class, you could possibly</p>

<ul>
<li>Cache the sorted output, as a separate list from the input list, and/or</li>
<li>store a copy of the input list instead of the input list itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>That last point speaks to another issue - you assume that you're being passed a list, which isn't strictly necessary; all you need is an iterable. If you create a list from the input, you place fewer demands on your caller.</p>

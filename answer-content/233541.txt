<p>Here is my feedback</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why do you use full types name, like <code>System.Double</code> ? I prefer shorter version , just <code>double</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Also I prefer to use <code>var</code> as it makes code shorter and more readable. So instead of <code>IDictionary&lt;string, dynamic&gt; dictionary = new Dictionary&lt;string, dynamic&gt;();</code> I would use <code>var dictionary = new Dictionary&lt;string, dynamic&gt;();</code> which looks neater for me.</p></li>
<li><p>For some reason you do not handle <code>float</code> datatype ... Probaly you just missed it. The same for <code>char</code> and <code>boolean</code> datatypes. So your code will fail for class with these properties types.</p></li>
<li><p>That is also strange that you <code>Round</code> only <code>double</code> values. What about <code>float</code> and <code>decimal</code> types ? probably you should be consistent.</p></li>
<li><p>Looks like in first <code>if</code> statement you wanted to check if type is built-in primitive type. I would recommend extract separate method for it - <code>IsPrimitiveType(Type type)</code></p></li>
<li><p>Function name <code>FormatDictionary</code> is misleading as for me. Because it does not format a dictionary, but filter it. So, I think <code>FilterDictionary</code> is a better name</p></li>
<li><p>It is considered as bad practice to modify input parameter inside function, but <code>FormatDictionary</code> does it. I would recommend to create new collection and return it, instead of modifying existed one</p></li>
</ol>

<p>That is what I see on the first glance. Probably there is something else if look closer :)</p>

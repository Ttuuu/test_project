<p>I like your architecture decomposition. Especially separation of model and realm object. From what I see it is correct and quite clean.
One thing to consider is to keep using <code>RxXX</code> to complement <code>LiveData</code>, where LiveData is lifecycle-aware container of data and <code>Rx</code> component is something with nice transformation api that you actually subscribe to.</p>
<p>I don't see Dao implementing LiveData as a good idea. Keep it as it is, it's methods returning LiveData.</p>

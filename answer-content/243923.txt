<p>It is really hard to say, but at least for me, your code is fine. It seems readable and has no issues. Perhaps if you want to change the style and make it more "canonical", you could write instead:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>computed: {
    getfilteredData() {
      return this.blogs.filter(blog =&gt;
        blog.name.toLowerCase().includes(this.search.toLowerCase()) ||
          blog.category.toLowerCase().includes(this.search.toLowerCase())
      )
    }
  },
</code></pre>
<p>But for me (and I believe, most readers of this post) your code is just fine.</p>
<p>Note: for "canonical" I mean fewer lines of code and more compactness. Clearly, it should be done rationally, and you should not write a 200 characters line. The point is write less and allow readability.</p>
<h3>Edit</h3>
<p>As <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/120114/s%E1%B4%80%E1%B4%8D-on%E1%B4%87%E1%B4%8C%E1%B4%80">Sᴀᴍ Onᴇᴌᴀ</a> answered, it could be substantially optimized if you do:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>    getfilteredData() {
      const lowerCaseSearch = this.search.toLowerCase();
      return this.blogs.filter(blog =&gt;
        blog.name.toLowerCase().includes(lowerCaseSearch) ||
          blog.category.toLowerCase().includes(lowerCaseSearch)
      )
    }
</code></pre>
<p>because you are creating the lowercase string of your search field only once and using it twice instead of creating it twice and use it twice.</p>

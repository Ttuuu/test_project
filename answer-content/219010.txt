<p>Instead of a visited_nodes list you can replace it with a position to node dictionary. That way you can get the old node with <code>node = known_nodes[node_position]</code> (if not present create new one). Then you can add a boolean <code>seen</code> to the node and use that to bail out the inner loop.</p>

<p>Keeping the list mostly sorted using a heap helps, though you still need to look for the updated nodes in the array.</p>

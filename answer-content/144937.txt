<p>Reasonable quality code. Here are a few comments:</p>

<p>1) I'd add a method <code>drawNextCard</code>, which encapsulates retrieval of the next card, and makes the code a bit more readable</p>

<pre><code>def draw_next_card(drawn_cards):
    card = drawn_cards.pop(len(drawn_cards)-1)
    return readable_card_name(card)

def readable_card_name(short_card_name):
    return (short_card_name[0]+"["+short_card_name[1]+"]")
</code></pre>

<p>Then, for example, your <code>flop()</code> method would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>def flop(self):
    (self.card1, self.card2, self.card3) = (draw_next_card(drawn_cards), draw_next_card(drawn_cards), draw_next_card(drawn_cards)) 
     self.flop = self.card1+ " - " + self.card2 + " - " + self.card3
     print (self.flop)
</code></pre>

<p>More readable, shorter, and on the way we fixed a copy/paste defect where you initialized <code>card2</code> twice instead of <code>card2</code> and <code>card3</code>.</p>

<p>2) You convert each drawn card to a readable representation. It's good for your debugging, but not so good for adding future functionality for actually calculating poker hands, and developing strategy. So, while my <code>draw_next_card</code> above returns a readable representation, you're better off creating a class <code>Card</code>, which has an <code>__str__</code> method that has the same implementation as <code>readable_class_name</code>. The <code>flop</code> method would remain the same, but it will be much easier to extend the code.</p>

<p>3) Note that <code>flop</code> and <code>river</code> are copy/pastes. Both could just call <code>draw_next_card</code>. Also, while the <code>flow</code> and <code>river</code> are true to the game terms, they're not much benefit to software; you'd be better off collapsing <code>flop</code>, <code>turn</code> and <code>river</code> to a <code>table_cards[5]</code> vector. Once you start developing the actual game, it will make things much easier for you.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

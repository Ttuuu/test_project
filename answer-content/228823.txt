<h2>Convergence testing</h2>

<pre><code>    if pi == piold:
        break
</code></pre>

<p>This is not usually done, because float equality has a lot of gotchas. In this case it's possible due to the numbers being Decimal, but if you need to move away from Decimal you're going to encounter issues.</p>

<p>Usually, convergence is measured as the absolute error decreasing below a chosen epsilon, a very small positive number. One advantage is that if you start checking for convergence to epsilon, your code will be compatible with arbitrary-precision math, where the two numbers will never equal each other exactly but you still need sane termination criteria.</p>

<h2>Formatting/rounding</h2>

<pre><code>D(str(pi)[:-3])
</code></pre>

<p>This looks troublesome. You're converting a float to a string, and then selecting a certain number of fixed digits. Don't do this. Instead, just use the built-in <code>round</code>, which works with <code>Decimal</code>s just fine.</p>

<h2>Order of Operations</h2>

<pre><code>pi = ((a + b)**2) / (2 * t)
</code></pre>

<p>Exponentiation takes precedence over division, so you can drop the first pair of outer parens.</p>

<h2>Import assignment</h2>

<pre><code>D = decimal.Decimal
</code></pre>

<p>Usually you shouldn't do this, and instead you should use normal import syntax:</p>

<pre><code>from decimal import Decimal as D
</code></pre>

<p>Not familiar with CAN yet so just one suggestion:</p>
<p>Get rid of those <code>print</code> statements, use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">logging</a> module instead. See also here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#logging-basic-tutorial" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Basic Logging Tutorial</a> and here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html#logging-cookbook" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Logging Cookbook</a>
Some benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>being able to write to multiple destinations: console + text files in different formats if desired</li>
<li>increase or reduce verbosity at will</li>
<li>keep a permanent record of program activity (and exceptions !)</li>
</ul>
<p>It's easy to miss console output and not having a persistent, timestamped log makes it more difficult to track bugs or investigate incidents.</p>
<p>If your application is mission-critical/ unattended you could send logging output to a dedicated <strong>log collector</strong>, which could generate alerts when warning/error messages are emitted, or when your application crashes for some reason.</p>

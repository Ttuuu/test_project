<p>Your code contains a large amount of special-case handling, and as Peter Taylor already pointed out, it doesn't always produce correct results. Inputs with an even length that don't end with an <code>a</code> in particular, but also several odd-length inputs.</p>

<p>Let's take a step back and look at the problem from a different angle:</p>

<ul>
<li>For a string <code>s</code>, there are <code>s.Length + 1</code> 'insertion points'. Each point can hold at most two <code>a</code>'s, so that gives you a maximum of <code>(s.Length + 1) * 2</code> insertions.</li>
<li>Each standalone <code>a</code> affects two insertion points - one to its left and one to its right. At most one <code>a</code> can be inserted in one of these points. Instead of 2 * 2 = 4 insertions, you now only have 1. That's a -3 reduction.</li>
<li>Each <code>aa</code> pair affects 3 insertion points - one to their left, one to their right, and one in-between the <code>a</code>'s. No insertions are possible in any of these points, so instead of 3 * 2 = 6, you now have 0. That's a -6 reduction, or a -3 reduction per <code>a</code>.</li>
<li>Inputs that contain an <code>aaa</code> triplet are invalid.</li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, the number of insertions can easily be calculated from the string length and the number of <code>a</code>'s. The only special case you need to handle is the presence of an <code>"aaa"</code> substring.</p>

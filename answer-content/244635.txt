<p>First thing first, get rid of these ugly <code>a</code> and <code>c</code>. They do not add any value, but only obfuscate the code.</p>
<pre><code>def gap(p, q, m):
    """To generate gap in between two prime numbers"""
"""p is the difference,q is the lower limit where the list of numbers in between which prime is filtered,m is the upper limit"""
    b = []
    q = (q // 2) * 2 + 1
    for i in range(q, m + 1, 2):
        if prime(i):
            b.append(i)
            if len(b) &gt; 1:
                if b[-1] - b[-2] == p:
                    return [b[-2], b[-1]]
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that I also removed a redundant <code>== True</code>.</p>
<p>Second, you don't need to keep the entire list of primes. You are only interested in the last two of them. Consider</p>
<pre><code>def gap(p, q, m):
    b = find_first_prime_after(q)
    for i in range(b + 2, m + 1, 2):
        if prime(i):
            if i - b == p:
                return b, i
            b = i
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, your primality test is very suboptimal. Implementing the sieve would give you a boost.</p>

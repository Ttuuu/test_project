<p>I can't comment due to being new here, but Roland Illig's assertion that it should be <code>++step</code> and not <code>step++</code> and that it shows that you do not understand C++ is incorrect.</p>

<p>In C++, the position of the <code>++</code> determines the order of how the expression is evaluated. So in <code>++step</code>, the variable is incremented before any action with it is performed, while in <code>step++</code>, the action is performed before the value is incremented. Just having a <code>step++</code> or <code>++step</code> as a single line of code is basically equivalent, but the difference is apparent in an example like so:</p>

<pre><code>int step = 0;
std::cout &lt;&lt; ++step &lt;&lt; std::endl; // would print 1
std::cout &lt;&lt; step &lt;&lt; std::endl; // would print 1
</code></pre>

<p>while</p>

<pre><code>int step = 0;
std::cout &lt;&lt; step++ &lt;&lt; std::endl; // would print 0
std::cout &lt;&lt; step &lt;&lt; std::endl; // would print 1
</code></pre>

<p>Just clarifying this, as you should understand the difference as opposed to preferring one over the other for stylistic/reputation reasons!</p>

<p>I would consider an approach were you think of the array as a circular buffer, with the top of the stack being position 0. Each of your operations becomes a rotation. One position clockwise and one anticlockwise.  Or even both clockwise (or anticlockwise), one a single position rotation and one a size-1 rotations.</p>

<p>If you can change the data structure so that the top of the stack can be any position in the circular buffer the these rotations become trivial, just set the top of value.</p>

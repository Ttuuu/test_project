<p><code>using namespace std;</code> is a bad practice.  You should should spell out either what you are using, or spell out explicitly the <code>std::</code> when you are using something.  You are doing the latter already with <code>std::to_string</code> and <code>std::cout</code>, just not with <code>string</code>.</p>

<p>Your <code>palindromeCheck</code> function should return a <code>bool</code>, instead of an <code>int</code> with specific integers having certain meanings.</p>

<p><code>temp</code> is not used.</p>

<p>You are checking both <code>100 * 101</code> and <code>101 * 100</code>.   Multiplication is commutative, so you can cut your work in half by adjusting your inner <code>y</code> loop to only use number from a range which hasn't been checked yet (from <code>x</code> to <code>999</code>, inclusive).</p>

<p><code>newDigit</code> is an odd variable name for the product of <code>x * y</code>.</p>

<p><code>palindromeCheck(newDigit)</code> is an expensive operation.  <code>newDigit &gt; highestPalindrome</code> is a relatively cheap test.  Consider reversing the order of these tests to avoid calling an expensive function when the result will never be used.</p>

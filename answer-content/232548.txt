<p>When testing functions that accept primitive number types you must always test the limits of the value space. Add tests for Integer.MAX_VALUE and Integer.MIN_VALUE in combination with each other and with smaller numbers. The point of these tests is to verify that any possible arithmetic operation there may be does not suffer from over- and underflow.</p>

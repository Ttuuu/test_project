<p>Two observations:</p>

<p>Instead of <code>private static final int[] MULTIPLES = new int[] { 3, 5 };</code></p>

<p>You can omit <code>new int[]</code> and write  <code>private static final int[] MULTIPLES = { 3, 5 };</code></p>

<p>Also, since you're setting the <code>MAX_NUMBER</code> why not simply set it to 999? That way your <code>MAX_NUMBER - 1</code> lines could just be <code>MAX_NUMBER</code></p>

<p>As was already answered the code works optimally, performance wise, but becomes exponentially more complex if you want to add multiples, which is why, in those expansive cases, I prefer the intuition of the obvious solution.</p>

<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>You can do:</p>

<pre><code>changeText = () =&gt; {
    firstDay.textContent = weekday[(day + 1) % 7]
    secondDay.textContent = weekday[(day + 2) % 7]
    thirdDay.textContent = weekday[(day + 3) % 7]
    fourthDay.textContent = weekday[(day + 4) % 7]
    fifthDay.textContent = weekday[(day + 5) % 7]
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also I'd recommend passing <code>day</code> as a parameter. Just so that it's more clear.</p>
    </div>

<p><strike>I have never seen <code>innerWidth</code> or <code>innerHeight</code> report the wrong value. There are a few bugs listed for chrome and firefox but they are all closed.</strike></p>
<p><strike>Could you provide any evidence?</strike></p>
<h1>UPDATE</h1>
<p>Media query matches down to fractions of a CSS pixel while <code>innerWidth</code> returns integer CSS pixel values. This is a problem when <code>devicePixelRatio !== devicePixelRatio | 0</code></p>
<p>I tried to find a cover all solution, but too much time need to complete so I withdraw the answers content.</p>

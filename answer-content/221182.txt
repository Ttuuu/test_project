<p>To be honest, I am not sure whether this question is on topic. There is literally only a handful lines of code, just a single conditional operator. With so much (as architecture, intentions, the desired goal) left out. But well. </p>

<p>I have but two suggestions.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Use Twig.</strong> It will solve ALL your problems at once. 

<ul>
<li>Twig supports <em>template inheritance</em>. This is an enormously helpful feature, in your case it will let a particular template to decide whether to include the main site template or not. As a result, no need to mingle with viewName, viewFile, viewAnything. Just call a template, that's all.</li>
<li>The main template will be a single file instead of a bunch of separate "header, footer, sidebar... whatever" files, which helps editing a lot. </li>
<li>Twig supports blocks as well, so again you can move your sidebar around in every other template. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Error reporting. The current approach is flawed. In how many places you are going to add that <code>echo 'Oops, something went wrong, we are looking into it!';</code>? and what if you some day will decide to add some HTML to it? Or what if a client will expect JSON-formatted error, not a plain text? Instead of that clumsy echo with an error class combination you should really use an <em>error/exception handler</em>. In case a file is not found, an error will be raised, then your handler will intercept it, and then, in the handler, you are free to echo any text and use whatever logging method which pleases you. All in a single place. As a result, you will have

<ul>
<li>less code to write </li>
<li>centralized error processing</li>
<li>the more informative error message (the filesystem will tell you the exact reason instead of your generic "View wasn't able to load").   </li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

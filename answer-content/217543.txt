<p>To complete the alternate ways to achieve what you are doing (flattening a list of lists into a single list), there is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.chain" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>itertools.chain</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import chain

lists = [[1,2], [3, 4]]
output = list(chain.from_iterable(lists))
</code></pre>

<p>This is not so useful in this particular case (at least it is not really better than the alternatives), but it can be if you only need to iterate over the output once (since it is a generator). This allows you to not store the flattened list in memory.</p>

<pre><code>for x in chain.from_iterable(lists):
    print(x)
</code></pre>

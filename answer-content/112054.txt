<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to test that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When <code>DoLogOut</code> is called, then <code>invalidateSession()</code> is called and the user is redirected to the login page.</p></li>
<li><p>And that when <code>GetUser</code> is called AFTER <code>DoLogOut</code>, that  a new session is created</p></li>
<li><p>And that when <code>GetUser</code> is called again, then the same user is returned.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The value of the privete <code>user</code> field should <strong>NOT</strong> be tested, as it is only an internal implementation detail.</p>

<p>Also what should <code>GetUser</code> do if the user has not yet logged in?</p>
    </div>

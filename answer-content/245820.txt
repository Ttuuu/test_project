<p>For your for-loop, you can use <code>reversed(name)</code> instead of <code>name[::-1]</code>. This will increase performance by preventing unnecessary copying by creating a generator instead of another string. However in your case, because you are only checking if the reversed is the same as the original, your function can be even simpler</p>
<pre><code>def palindrome(name):
    return name.lower() == name[::-1].lower()
</code></pre>

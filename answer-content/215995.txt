<p>HEAL doesn't change the relative order. So there is no point in rebuilding queue. Keep a sum of total HEAL so far, and remember it for each monster. Then, when HEAL happens you just do <code>totalHealSoFar++</code> and to display proper score on KILL return <code>health+(totalHealSoFar-totalHealWhenThisMonsterWasCreated)</code>. </p>

<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>You could start putting all this in a function:</p>

<pre><code>def foo(row_dict):
       row_dict_clean = {}
        for key, value in row_dict.items():
            value_clean = get_cleantext(value)
            row_dict_clean[key] = value_clean
        return row_dict_clean
</code></pre>

<p>and then puting everything inside a comprehension list:</p>

<pre><code>json_data_clean = [foo(row_dict) for row_dict in json_data]
total = len(json_data_clean)
</code></pre>

<p>I tried to create the dictionary with a comprehension, but it does not seem to give so much improvement. Maybe the dataset is too small, but in case you want to try, substitute the second loop for:</p>

<pre><code>row_dict_clean = {key: get_cleantext(value) for key, value in row_dict.items()}
</code></pre>

<p>Maybe there are more performances that can be done with the dictionaries itself, but this for sure will save you good time.</p>

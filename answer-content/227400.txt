<h1><code>Test</code> class</h1>

<ol>
<li>In the scope of code you provided, the <code>div</code> is useless and may be omitted:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>render() {
  return this.state.comments.map((comment, index) =&gt; (
    &lt;Comment key={index} comment={comment}/&gt;
  ))
}
</code></pre>

<ol start="2">
<li>However, as React warns you in the console, don't forget to <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pass a <code>key</code> prop to your array items</a> (added in the snippet above).</li>
</ol>

<h1><code>Comment</code> class</h1>

<ol>
<li>The method name <code>renderSidebar</code> suggest to me that it will return something that React can render, but it returns an object of CSS styles instead. For that reason, I'd rename it to <code>getSidebarStyle</code>.</li>
<li>Since the method <code>renderSidebar</code> doesn't depend on anything except its parameters and doesn't alter any instance variables (it's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pure function</a>), you can move it outside the class.</li>
<li>The array of <code>colors</code> has nothing to do with the logic of selecting a color depending on the intendation level. Depending on your coding style preferences, you could move it to outside the method and capitalize it.</li>
<li>When rendering the subcomments, set a <code>key</code> prop on your array items as above.</li>
<li><a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">JSX is camel-cased</a> and that's why React warns you in the console to change your CSS property names (e.g. <code>border-left</code> to <code>borderLeft</code>), also allowing you to omit the quotes.</li>
</ol>

<p>Generally, your code is in good shape &amp; all of the comments above are more or less only improvements. To help you move faster, I suggest always checking the console for helpful warnings and using tools such as <a href="https://prettier.io/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Prettier</a> and a linter for your JS dialect to help you while programming.</p>

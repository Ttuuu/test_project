<p>Semi-colons aren't necessarily required in JavaScript, and to be honest <a href="https://flaviocopes.com/javascript-automatic-semicolon-insertion/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">it's a pretty divisive topic in the JS community</a>. Having said that, I think that it is generally considered good practice to always terminate your statements. Using things such as a beautifier or minifier will typically add semi-colons into your code where necessary/missing (depending on your rules). </p>

<p>If you follow some popular JS code style guides; <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html#formatting-semicolons-are-required" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Google's Style Guide</a>, they indicate that semi-colons are required and automatic insertion is forbidden. <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/javascript#semicolons" rel="nofollow noreferrer">AirBnB's Style Guide</a> basically says the exact same thing.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
To clarify, I am saying that this snippet would be the "recommended" way to go, if you were to follow either of the 2 style guides that I shared.</p>

<pre><code>myNode.addEventListener('click', () =&gt; { console.log('You clicked myNode.'); }, false);
</code></pre>

<p>You need the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50501047/one-line-arrow-functions-without-braces-cant-have-a-semicolon">braces in an arrow function, if you want to use semicolons</a>. If you don't want to use semicolon, braces are not required for syntactic correctness.</p>

<h1>Caching</h1>
<p>You can increase performance by caching the result.  For each number generated by the sequence, cache the number and it's length in a <code>dict</code>.  The later, if the sequence generates a number you've already seen, you can abort the sequence and add in the remaining length.</p>
<p>For really long sequences this can save you a lot of time.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> you should be caching across all runs, so that the work you do in earlier tests can be preserved during later tests.</p>

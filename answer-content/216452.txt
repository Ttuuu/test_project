<p>There are a few points I would like to add ontop of the <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/216451/92478">feedback already given</a> by Reinderien.</p>

<h2>Remove nested functions</h2>

<p>There is no good reason to define <code>house()</code>, <code>deeperhouse()</code>, etc. inside of <code>game()</code>. If your plan was to hide them from the user in this ways, you have probably chosen the wrong language. If you intend to indicate that these are not to be used directly, prefix their name with a leading underscore <code>_house()</code>. This is a <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#method-names-and-instance-variables" rel="nofollow noreferrer">common convention</a> to notify others that these functions are not intended to be used by them and are subject to change/removal/... without further notice.</p>

<p>Also think about how you use these functions. Basically, your game's "flow" is encoded in them by calling deeper and deeper into other functions without ever returning.</p>

<h2>Break lines to improve readability</h2>

<p>Your text message come in super-long lines of text. Most text editors support automatic line breaking or soft wrap to cram those lines to the available screen width, but some don't (like the code preview here) or are deliberately configured not to do so. So be nice and break your lines if they get to long.<br>
Python's official style guide <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#maximum-line-length" rel="nofollow noreferrer">recommends 79/80 characters</a> as maximum line length, although most modern IDEs and their style tools let you get away with about 100 (without manual tweaking) before getting upset.<br>
Python allows you to do this within the parenthesis of a function call without further line continuation markers.</p>

<p>Applying this to <code>house()</code>, your code could look like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>def house():
    print("You walk inside slowly, nearly crying because you are such a baby")
    print("You look around the building, there is a selection of objects on the ground, "
          "a stick, a backpack, and a deagle with 100 rounds next to it. oh and lest we not "
          "forget, some mushrooms, picking them up will make you eat them immediately.")
    print("What do you want to do now?")
    items1()
</code></pre>

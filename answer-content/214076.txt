<li><p>Any time you feel compelled to put a comment like</p>

<pre><code>    // read key file
</code></pre>

<p>consider factoring the relevant code into a function, e.g. <code>read_key_file(....)</code>. Notice how the comment becomes unnecessary.</p></li>
<li><p>If you <em>can</em> process a stream, <em>do</em> process a stream. Read <code>stdin</code>, output to <code>stdout</code>. The benefits of stream processing are</p>

<ul>
<li><p>No need to allocate a (possibly huge) buffer for am input file</p></li>
<li><p>The program can be part of a pipeline</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The <code>int mainFileSize;</code> is more than questionable. File size may well exceed the limit of <code>int</code>. It may even exceed the limits of <code>long</code> which <code>ftell</code> returns. Use <code>ftello</code> (which returns <code>off_t</code>, wide enough to accommodate <em>any</em> file size).</p></li>
<li><p>The only place you do need to know the file size, and allocate a buffer dynamically, is reading of the key file. If the key file is larger than 100 bytes, your code faces an out-of-bound access problems.</p></li>
<li><p>As a side note, I don't see a reason for <code>consoleOutput</code> flag to exist. There are better debugging techniques. In any case, if you want to use it, provide a command line option to control its value.</p></li>

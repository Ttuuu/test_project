<p>The first thing I noticed was that <code>while</code> loop in <code>play_hand()</code>. It has too many conditions. I'd just do <code>while True:</code> and then exit with a <code>break</code>.</p>

<p>You can do something similar in the other loop as well. This will make it so you don't have to repeat yourself so often and will significantly clean up your code.</p>

<p>Also there's a few other things you can do: You can simplify your dealer's code by just having the dealer get to 17 immediately instead of drawing one and then waiting until the player ended their turn.</p>

<p>You should move your over-21 check into the main <code>while</code> loop. And get rid of that <code>bust</code> variable, there's no need for it.</p>

<p>And there's no need for a <code>new_card</code> variable. Just check the end of the list of the player's cards.</p>

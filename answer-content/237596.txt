<p>I'm not that good with java so I'll just say what I understand.</p>

<p>In my opinion what you could have done is instead of copying to another array you could have just checked the original array and if you didn't find the the number to be consecutive just add it to the new array. </p>

<p>We need to check the whole array so that is gonna take <span class="math-container">$$\mathcal{O}(n)$$</span> time. Copying the whole array would be more costly in my opinion.</p>

<p>If you are looking to improve your understanding of algorithm I would recommend these books 'Introduction to Algorithm' or 'Algorithm design'.</p>

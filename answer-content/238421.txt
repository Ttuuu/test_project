<p>Some suggestions for optimizing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Did you consider the option that the API request could be taking the longest time? Maybe it's worth it to check whether the API has an option to extract multiple records at once.</li>
<li>It might be possible that <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_json.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pd.read_json</code></a> will suit your needs, but I never worked with it so you might have to figure out if nested dictionaries can be read, and if yes, how.</li>
<li>Setting fields using <code>.loc</code> is much slower than creating a list and setting it as a column at once.</li>
<li>A general tip: create some timers to check which part of your code is the slowest. Start with optimizing at the slowest part. You can also make use of a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">profiler</a> instead of creating timers, but that can be complicated.</li>
</ul>

<p>A nitpick on names: The dimensions of a rectangle should be <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> not <code>width</code> and <code>length</code>. The constructor of Triangle should take descriptive parameter names, such as <code>side1Length</code>. You have more excuse to use <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> for private fields (especially in this short, pure math code), but single-character names are generally frowned upon.</p>

<p>Add javadoc comments, at least to the methods in your abstract class/interface. The comment to your <code>Shape</code> class is almost a javadoc, but it is missing one <code>*</code>.</p>

<p>For extra credit, replace your <code>main()</code> method with 3 unit tests (1 test class with 3 methods) that can be easily run from the IDE.</p>

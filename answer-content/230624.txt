  <p>If the input is different, the function will of course call itself again (that's why it is a recursive one, right?)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is dangerous, as user can keep entering wrong inputs, which will increment scoping stack (eventually resulting in StackOverflowException being thrown).<br>
Even doubly so, your function is the beginning of the program (it's not returning but calling dashboard() to pass on), so all stack layers made by wrong inputs will be kept all the way through</p>

<p>Most basic approach of mitigating this is making it a loop with exiting condition</p>

<pre><code>do
{
    //Input from console
}while(/*input isn't the one we need*/)
</code></pre>

<p>You may even add some protection from spamming and limit amount of tries later simply by working around this loop (unlike function stack, where you need to carry iteration results into next layers)</p>

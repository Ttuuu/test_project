<p>There is not much to review here. This algorithm looks to be as good as it gets. I don't know how much value there is in nitpicking, but here I go:</p>

<h3>Review</h3>

<ul>
<li><em>The summary tag should be used to describe a type or a type member. Use remarks to add supplemental information</em> (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/summary" rel="nofollow noreferrer">xmldoc summary</a>) -&gt; put the challenge URL in a remarks tag, not in the summary.</li>
<li>The challenge provides an input parameter <code>nums</code> but <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/general-naming-conventions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">C# naming conventions</a> don't invite you to use abbreviations. You could/should change its name to <code>numbers</code>.</li>
<li>Your unit test contains a variable with a typo <code>excpected</code>. </li>
<li>Your method is declared public, meaning you should check arguments against null to avoid the nasty <code>NullReferenceException</code>.</li>
<li>You've added alot of inline comments to show how the algorithm works. Considering the simplicity of the algorithm and the presence of unit tests, I feel these comments don't add much value to the code, if any at all <code>//else continue to next item</code> etc.</li>
</ul>

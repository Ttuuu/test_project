<p>I saw your <code>substrings</code> function and expected to tell you to use <code>yield</code> instead of creating a list, but you already do. I also like your comment on why you use <code>range</code>. If you want to be <em>completely</em> compatible with Python 3, though, you'll need to use parentheses for <code>print</code>:</p>

<pre><code>print(Question2("stresseddesserts"))
</code></pre>

<p>The only other thing I'll mention is that <code>Question2</code> does not follow official Python naming guidelines as defined in PEP 8. According to that document, function names should use snake_case. Your assignment also uses lowercase, so I'm a little surprised you changed it especially since your other functions are lowercase.</p>

<p>All in all, the program is concise, efficient, and organized. Well done.</p>

<p>For one thing, you should <em>always</em> format your code properly (with indentation) when posting it publicly. Some would say you should even format it properly when <em>writing</em> it, regardless of where you're going to post it. :)</p>

<p>Second, you'll have to define what problem you're trying to solve. Your <em>stated</em> problem is easily solved by something like this:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    puts("   T");
    puts("  TE");
    puts(" TES");
    puts("TEST");
    puts("EST ");
    puts("ST  ");
    puts("T   ");
}
</code></pre>

<p>Much shorter, and it can be seen at a glance to be correct! (Your posted solution works, modulo case-sensitivity, but it is long and not <em>obviously</em> correct.)</p>

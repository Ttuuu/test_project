<p>What's certainly extremely <em>very</em> non-LISPy is your <em>opening</em> parens ending the line of code like that. With that, <code>mapcar</code> and explicit <code>#'</code> in front of <code>lambda</code>, it could look like</p>

<pre><code>(defun schwartzian-files-mtime ( glob-pattern )
    (mapcar #'cdr
        (stable-sort
            (mapcar #'(lambda (x) 
                        (cons (sb-posix:stat-mtime (sb-posix:stat x))
                              x))
                    (directory glob-pattern))
            #'&lt;
            :key #'car)))
</code></pre>

<p>This looks natural to me, but still may be off w.r.t. official style guidelines. It has a "quick-n-dirty" feel to it, like something you'd scribble on the spot (not unlike Randal's original piece of code), not a proper production code with documentation string etc..</p>

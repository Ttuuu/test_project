<ul>
<li>The database setup <code>mydb</code> should be in it's own function, or even just
a global since this script is rather minimal.  There's no reason to
duplicate this code.</li>
<li>If <code>mysql.connector</code> doesn't, I'd look for a database connector that
supports the <code>with ...</code> statement for connections and transactions
(relatively sure e.g. sqlalchemy supports that).  Because you can
always forget to call <code>commit</code> (or <code>rollback</code>), but with <code>with</code> you
have a little bit less mental overhead.</li>
<li>It's a simple script ... long term I'd worry about losing data that
way.  Also why is it dropping the whole table instead of, say,
<code>DELETE FROM webdata;</code> and only recreating the table if it doesn't
exist?</li>
<li>The <code>bs4</code> part looks okay and the insert too; I'd perhaps have some
checks in there that you don't overflow on the 255 limit with the
review (or the name I suppose).  Also some warnings around empty
values might be good for you to debug / notice that something's off.</li>
<li>AFAIK <code>requests</code> is a good choice, you might also want to check the
status code though.</li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, so long-term:</p>

<ul>
<li>To be more flexible, look at <code>argparse</code> or any of the command line
parsing libraries so that you never have to edit the script in case
one of the parameters changes (database connection, URL).  I'd keep
the HTML querying like it is, that's usually not wise to put into a
configuration unless it changes frequently.</li>
</ul>

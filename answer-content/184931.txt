<p>Since you are repeatedly using <code>$(date +\%F-\%T)</code>, you can store that as a variable (unless you want to also know how long it took the script to jump between statements). Use that variable instead.</p>

<p>Similarly, set a basepath, which in your case, is <code>/var/www/html</code>. In case it changes in the future, it'll be just enough to change it in one place.</p>

<p>At the end, you have</p>

<pre><code>rm -rf db-$(date +\%F-\%T).zip html-$(date +\%F-\%T).zip
</code></pre>

<p>which will try to delete those files from <code>CWD</code>, which might not be the same as <code>/var/www/html</code>.</p>

<p><code>mysqldump</code> has options such as <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysqldump.html#option_mysqldump_compact" rel="noreferrer"><code>--compact</code></a> and <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysqldump.html#option_mysqldump_compress" rel="noreferrer"><code>--compress</code></a>. Making use of them will result in smaller <code>sql</code> files, resulting in even smaller <code>zip</code>s; saving you some disk space.</p>

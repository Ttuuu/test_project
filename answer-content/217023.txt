<p>The <code>lookup</code> dictionary might grow as large as the size of array (all array elements are distinct). It immediately gives an <span class="math-container">\$(O(n))\$</span> space complexity, and has detrimental effect on the time complexity as well. It is possible to get away with <span class="math-container">\$O(k))\$</span>.</p>

<p>It makes no difference if <span class="math-container">\$k \approx n\$</span>, but boosts the performance for <span class="math-container">\$k \ll n\$</span> (which I presume is so for the bulk of test cases).</p>

<p>To keep the dictionary "small", observe that if its size reaches <code>k</code>, it is safe to remove the oldest element. As a side benefit, you wouldn't need to test for <code>cur - prev &lt;= k</code> anymore.</p>

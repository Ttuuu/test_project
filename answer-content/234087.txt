<p>Optionals do not improve your code. You're using if statements and null checks just like they are intended to be used. There is no need to improve anything there.</p>

<p>Edit: If-statements and null-checks are not evil. There is no need to try to get rid of either one and Optionals were not intended to replace them. The evil is having an API made by someone else and not knowing if it returns a null or not. Optionals were intended to give the person reading the code and the compiler compiling it a strongly typed fact about the possibility of a <em>method return value</em> not existing.</p>

<p>If I have to try to find something worth mentioning from your code it's the use of heavy String.format to create a trivial exception message. Just use concatenation like in the logging statements. :)</p>

<p>Most is already said by GiantTree, so only one additional remark: after replacing <code>func</code> with <code>BinaryOperator</code> (or in this case <code>IntBinaryOperator</code>) and the calculation with reduce, the only thing your run method really does is an array lookup.</p>

<p>You can solve this directly with the existing standard library - the following is equivalent to your code:</p>

<pre><code>IntStream.rangeClosed(0, 5).map(i -&gt; array[i]).reduce(0, (a, b) -&gt; a + b);
</code></pre>

<p>My advice: don't reinvent the wheel, get a good grip on the basic libraries instead.</p>

<p>I think your question only needs you to determine if there is more than one integer out of sequence in the array passed in. </p>

<p>You could just loop through the array passed in and if you find an integer out of sequence count it, then jump over it. </p>

<p>If you find a second integer out of sequence then return false, if you don't find another in the array then return true. You should be able to achieve this with one loop which will speed up your code..</p>

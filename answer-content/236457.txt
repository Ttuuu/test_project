<p>Very nice.</p>

<p>I've used your code as a foundation for <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/236444/indexdb-rxjs-angular-service">IndexDB (RxJs) - Angular Service</a>.</p>

<p>Some things I noticed:</p>

<ol>
<li>The try/catch won't intercept errors inside the subscription block (which is async). By adding try/catch block inside the subscription I was able to catch errors due to schema changes for get/put operations.</li>
<li>No need to accept <code>e: any</code> in the callback functions. Inside <code>req.onerror</code> you can read the <code>req.error</code> value. Inside <code>req.onsuccess</code> you can read the <code>req.result</code> value. These values are also typed.</li>
</ol>

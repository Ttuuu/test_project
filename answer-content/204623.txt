<h3>Everything is an Entity!</h3>

<p>If you would follow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93component%E2%80%93system" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Entity Component System</a> approach, that is. The idea is that all <em>objects</em> are <em>entities</em>, and each Entity has several <em>components</em>. Size, Position, Movable - all this are different aspects of what an Entity possibly could do and are therefore each it's own <code>Component</code>. As for Systems, that's where most of the logic is.</p>

<p>Names like <code>PositionableBoundable</code> and <code>MovableBoundable</code> sound weird because it is weird, you are trying to use one name for two things. <em>Composition over inheritance</em> is the key here.</p>

<p>As for the name <code>Boundable</code>, I would probably have gone for just <code>Box</code> or <code>Rect</code> which are more well known.</p>

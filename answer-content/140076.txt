<p>The code looks quite complicated at first glance, but when reading it, it is straightforward. If you want to make the code shorter, you can just do this:</p>

<pre><code>public static boolean equalsIgnoreNewlineStyle(String s1, String s2) {
    return s1 != null &amp;&amp; s2 != null &amp;&amp; normalizeLineEnds(s1).equals(normalizeLineEnds(s2));
}

private static String normalizeLineEnds(String s) {
    return s.replace("\r\n", "\n").replace('\r', '\n');
}
</code></pre>

<p>Concerning running time and GC stress, your code is probably better. Use a benchmark to see how much better it is.</p>

<p>The word twirks sounded negative to me, therefore I replaced it with style.</p>

<p>Since the two strings have equal rights and are treated the same, none of them should be called the "other one".</p>

<p>You should not make the constants <code>public</code>, since there is no need to do that.</p>

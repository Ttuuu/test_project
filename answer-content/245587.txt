<p><strong>Use of macros</strong></p>
<p>In this case, the macro you using is from a library header that was included with your compiler. This header (ultimately <code>limits.h</code>, although <code>&lt;climits&gt;</code> is usually used with C++ code) is also used by C code, so C++ specific language features cannot be used. These are OK to use.</p>
<p>The C++ way of referencing a minimum value for a type is to make use of <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/numeric_limits" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>std::numeric_limits</code></a> (in the <code>&lt;limits&gt;</code>) header. In your case, you can replace <code>_I64_MAX</code> with <code>std::numeric_limits&lt;int64_t&gt;::min()</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Other notes</strong></p>
<p>All of the references to <code>this-&gt;</code> are unnecessary and can be removed from your code. You rarely need to specify this in C++ code (there a few specific cases where it is needed, like for variable name disambiguation or calling a function thru a member function pointer).</p>
<p>The <code>for</code> loop might be able to be rewritten using iterators or the <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/range-for" rel="nofollow noreferrer">range-for</a> style if this is supported by the <code>SinglyLinkedList</code> type.</p>

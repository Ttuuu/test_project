<p>as OOP as is, I think this would avoid unneeded castings, and it gives you more managed approach to handle <code>enum</code> than using <code>enum</code> directly.</p>
<p>If <code>enum</code> was used directly, it would be possible to cast it to different type than a string, and it will make your hands tight when it comes to handle exceptions. so using <code>struct</code> with an internal <code>enum</code> would force typing it to only accept and output specified types, which avoid unnecessary exceptions and give you more OOP options to work with.</p>
<p>This is also a security approach where it adds restrictions on the input-output. In this case, avoiding <code>SQL Injections</code>.</p>
<p>Obviously it can be done in different approaches, however, this implementation would avoid some of the human-errors (like misspelling), and overriding. It would also add more readability and maintainability to the code and avoiding redundancy with less code possible.</p>

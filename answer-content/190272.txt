<p>I am out of practice in C++, so won't comment on code construct. But I will echo what user1118321 said about being 'complete'. I have created my own <code>Circle</code> class in VB.Net for a geospatial project. These are the methods and functions.</p>

<pre><code>Public Class Circle
    Private p_radius_sq As Decimal
    Private p_Centre As PointD 'Double - based user type for coordinates
    Private p_valid As Boolean ' if the construction fails for geometric reasons, the circle is invalid
    Private p_geometryhelper As New Geometry 'my own class of useful geometry functions
    Private p_rect As RectangleF

' Create circle from a point and a radius
    Public Sub New(Centre As PointD, radius As Decimal)

' Create a circle from three points
    Public Sub New(a As PointD, b As PointD, c As PointD)

' Creates a minimum bounding circle for a list of points.
    Public Sub New(ThePoints As List(Of PointD))

' Useful property for real-world calculations
    Public Property Radius_Squared() As Double

    Public Property Centre() As PointD

    Public ReadOnly Property Radius() As Double

    Public Property Valid() As Boolean

' Identify where one circle intersects with another.
    Public Function IntersectionPoints(OtherCircle As Circle) As List(Of PointD)

' Identifies if a set of points is enclosed by this circle
    Private Function EnclosesPoints(points As List(Of PointD), Optional skip1 As Integer = -1, Optional skip2 As Integer = -1, Optional skip3 As Integer = -1) As Boolean

' See if the circle encloses the nominated point
    Public Function EnclosesPoint(ThePt As PointD) As Boolean

End Class
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>PointD</code> and geometry helpers round out a series of useful functions for a powerful circle tool. In my application, I needed the <code>Decimal</code> type to get the precision (<code>Double</code> was not precise enough).</p>

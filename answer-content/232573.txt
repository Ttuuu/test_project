<p>Your <code>threadLocal</code> prevents a thread from unlocking a lock taken by a different thread. That's not good, as there are legitimate uses for this scenario (some producer-consumer).</p>

<p>What I also dislike is silently ignoring the unlock request. If it's forbidden, then it should probably throw.</p>

<p>Anyway, you can what you did without any thread local just by using <code>AtomicReference&lt;Thread&gt;</code> (with the content being the locking thread, or null, if it's free).</p>

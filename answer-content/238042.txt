<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>Public Const fRowType As Long = 4
Public Const fRowClosing As Long = fRowType + 1
Public Const fRowLoan As Long = fRowType + 4
'[there are about 30 of those fRow variables; they are needed in another _
 module, that's why they are public]

<p>First of all, they're not "variables" they're "constants".</p>

<p>Second, that's screaming for an array or <code>scripting.dictionary</code> to hold them instead of a hoard of <code>Const</code>. They could even be pulled into a class that can easily be initialized provided with <code>Get</code>ter properties (if the values are as fixed as <code>Const</code> would indicate) then the class can be passed around wherever it's needed.</p>

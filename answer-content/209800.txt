<p><code>permsOfInteger</code> uses math operations divide and module to convert an <code>Int</code> to an array. By contrast, <code>perms</code> converts digits to strings and joins them to convert an array to <code>Int</code>. I think it's good to be consistent, I would use math operations for converting in both directions. And I would extract these operations to helper methods <code>intToDigits</code> and <code>digitsToInt</code>.</p>

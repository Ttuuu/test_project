<p>Comments should tell the reader something useful and non-obvious.  Your comments are mainly noise, partly because the functions are so trivial that they need no comment.  As others have said, making the function name descriptive can often remove the need for comments, but I dislike very long function names.  A <code>getSum</code> function could be <code>sum_xyz</code> and be quite clear.  Your function names are bad (eg <code>getSum</code> doesn't 'get' the sum but instead prints it).</p>

<p>Dissecting a comment:</p>

<pre><code>/*The function getSum accepts three int
 *values and computes the sum of all three and prints
 *the result via standard output.
 */
</code></pre>

<p>Starting with "The function getSum"; this tells me nothing.  I know you are describing <code>getSum</code> because the comment precedes it.  The "accepts three int values" is clear from the prototype and tells me nothing new.  The most that need be said (if it were not already obvious from the code) would be:</p>

<pre><code>/* print sum of inputs on stdout */
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, <code>doDiv</code> would be:</p>

<pre><code>/* return (x/y)/z */
</code></pre>

<p>and <code>getDiv</code>:</p>

<pre><code>/* print (x/y)/z on stdout */
</code></pre>

<p>Note that people disagree on commenting, some liking more than others.  Often you will have to fit in with what your employer dictates. Some people like Doxygen, which has been suggested above.  Personally, I don't - a Doxygen version of your function header might be:</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * @fn void getSum(int x, int y, int z)
 * @brief print sum of inputs on stdout
 * @param x 1st input
 * @param y 2nd input
 * @param z 3rd input
 */
</code></pre>

<p>Using this you get your function included in a printable document of some sort but the cost is high (look at the redundancy! Also how ugly, compared to <code>print sum of inputs on stdout</code>) and you can be fairly sure that nobody maintaining your function (e.g. changing it at a later date to divide by 3) will touch the comment, leaving it progressively more out of date.  The other thing about Doxygen comments is that people spend inordinate amounts of time getting their printed documentation to look "just right".</p>

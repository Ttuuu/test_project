<p>my 2 cents worth</p>
<p>v nice clean code.</p>
<p>I would have called the generated variable N not self_N. That looks peculiar , plus all the other generated names are N## something, having something##N is also odd. In the macro call I said I wanted it called 'readBuff' so call it that.</p>
<p>the use of 0x00 for null is certainly correct buts its the first time I have ever seen it, its not idiomatic. I would say NULL (or plain 0).</p>
<p>Did you consider the possibility of creating the struct on the stack or statically? I mean there is no reason to place it on the heap. It doesn't grow and you don't need variable numbers of them.</p>

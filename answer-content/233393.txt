<li><p>Since you seem to be targeting Sphinx for your documentation you should either:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Specify your parameter types correctly in the docstring.</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>:param int dir_1: The direction of the first wind.
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Or</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>:param dir_1: The direction of the first wind.
:type dir_1: int
</code></pre>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/51312475">Get Sphinx to do this for you from PEP 484 type hints.</a> (Python 3.5+ notation)</p>

</ol></li>
<li><p>Your docstring is rather hard to read as they just go off forever. Limit the length of them so it's easier to read them when developing.</p></li>
<li>Take advantage of Sphinx <code>NOTE:</code> should use <code>.. note::</code>.</li>
<li>Your first two comments are pretty meh. The third should really be before the if so it's easier to read.</li>
<li>Check your spelling - number, between.</li>

<li><code>dir_2 &gt; dir_1</code> is always true when <code>dir_2 &gt; dir_1 + 180</code>.</li>
<li><code>dir_2 &gt; dir_1 and (dir_2 - dir_1 &gt; 180)</code> is the same as <code>diff &gt; 180</code>. So you can easily merge the ifs together.</li>

<h3>Code organization</h3>

<p>You created two classes, but didn't explain why. Don't create a class unless you have a good reason to do so. Example valid reasons to create a class:</p>

<ul>
<li>model real world objects</li>
<li>model abstract objects</li>
<li>reduce complexity</li>
<li>hide implementation details</li>
</ul>

<p>I strongly recommend to read the book Code Complete (2nd edition). If you're impatient, you can jump directly to chapter 6, working classes.</p>

<p>I suggest to combine the two classes. In addition, try to split the functionality to smaller functions, each with a single responsibility, and a descriptive name. The main method should do almost nothing, just call other functions that do the real work, which will be explained by their names. Chapter 7 in Code Complete can help you with this point.</p>

<h3>Variable declarations</h3>

<p>It's best to declare variables right before you use them. Don't declare variables at the top of a function of they are not used until the middle. Especially, don't declare a variable at a broader scope, when it can be declared in a more limited scope. In particular, the <code>input</code> variable should be declared inside the <code>while</code> loop.</p>

<h3>Naming</h3>

<p>It's impossible to guess what's going on here without reading the implementation of the <code>rps2</code> class:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>       rps2 rps2Object = new rps2();
       rps2Object.rps2();
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Also note that the convention in Java is to use <code>PascalCase</code> for class names.</p>

<p>These are also very poor names:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>   int b = 1;
   Scanner sage = new Scanner(System.in);
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>It's never a good idea to name program elements after your own name. <code>scanner</code> would be more appropriate, for example.</p>

<p>It seems the value of <code>b</code> never changes, your using it to write an infinite loop. The idiomatic writing style of an infinite loop is this:</p>

<pre><code>while (true) {
    // ...
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Usability</h3>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>"Play again? Y(8), N(9)?"
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>That is, enter 8 to mean yes, and enter 9 to mean no? It would be more natural to use y to mean yes and n to mean no.</p>

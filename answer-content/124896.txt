<p>In your test letter method you repeat the majority of the checks you make in your if statement, I think this hurts the readability of your code the most. One example of this is your first if statement and the second else if statement only vary by the last equality check. This equality check could instead occur in an if statement inside if the first check. </p>

<p>Generally, I think it is a good idea to limit the number of conditionals in an if statement. This won't always be true but it is one quick improvement you could make in your code.</p>

<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>I would also make an <code>interface</code> of these methods:</p>

<pre><code>interface investmentCompound
{
    double getQuarters(double numOfQuarters);   
    double getDimes(double numOfDimes);
    double getNickles(double numOfNickles);
    double performCalculations();
    double formatPrice(double priceToFormat);
    ...

}
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>The above will give your class a much better design and help you better code as well. Always program in such a way that when anyone reads your code, the method and variable names are self-explanatory on what your class is doing.</p></li>
<li><p>Give your <code>main()</code> function the minimal capability to just call methods and variables instead of declaring everything there.</p></li>
<li><p>In the real world, you will always have an API i.e. getters and setters and methods like how I mentioned in the interface above.  This is better practice, so when someone wants to call your code, they should be able to use the methods.</p></li>
<li><p>Since you are going to use <code>numOfNickles</code>, <code>numOfQuarters</code>, <code>numOfDimes</code> variable names several times, it's best to declare that at class level, so declare them as class variables instead of in <code>main()</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
    </div>

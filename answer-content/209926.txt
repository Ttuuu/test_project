<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>You could possibly store the rooms in a text file to reduce the code,
like this:</p>

<pre><code>if rooms == 1:
    N=10
    f=open("test.txt")
    for i in range(5):
        line=f.read().strip()
        print(line)
    f.close()
</code></pre>

<p>This will print what is inside the file and for the range you put the number of lines that are in the file.</p>
    </div>

<p>Multiple threads are usually used to compute things in parallel.
In this example nothing is computed in parallel:
while one thread is running,
the other is waiting.
With no practical value,
it's not a great demonstration of multithreading.
I suggest to look for more practical targets in the future.</p>

<p>Since <code>evenready</code> and <code>oddready</code> always have opposite values,
one of them would be enough, and less error-prone.</p>

<p>Instead of <code>for (; x &lt; 10;) {</code> it's more natural to use <code>while (x &lt; 10) {</code>.</p>

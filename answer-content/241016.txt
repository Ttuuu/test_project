  <p>I am not entirely sure if this is a good implementation of a Singleton so I am looking for some feedback, also is using a Singleton here the right way or could I better use a full static class?</p>

<p>I believe there's no added value to that setup and you'd be better off without it. This is just extra code and more complexity. </p>

<p>Supposedly you are trying to solve "to make sure only one ImGui context gets created", is that a real problem you have or an hypothetical problem?</p>

<p>My advice, don't create code that don't solve important problem. By doing so you are not spending time working on useful features and important problems. This is not an important problem. People on those communities will often tell you the opposite, ask them what software they are shipped.</p>

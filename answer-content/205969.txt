<p>It seems like a major misconception. The elegance of the solution does not depend on the language. The language does not create solutions, it only codifies them. It the approach taken is wrong, the language is powerless.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the approach taken here is wrong. You need to recall some math before diving in.</p>

<p>The direction in question is characterized by the sign of a cross product of <span class="math-container">\$b - a\$</span> and <span class="math-container">\$c - b\$</span>. It is a left turn if the cross product is positive, a right turn if it is negative, and a straight line if it is zero.</p>

<p>That said, your code fails badly when <code>x1 - x</code> happens to be zero. That alone should raise your doubt in the correctness of the approach.</p>

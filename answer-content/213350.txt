<p>Some suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li>There is very little structure. A game like this would typically have at least <code>Game</code>, <code>Question</code>, <code>Answer</code>, <code>Storage</code> and <code>Window</code> classes and a <code>main</code> method which just creates a <code>Game</code> and runs it.</li>
<li>Pull out fields or constants (as appropriate) for magic values such as strings and numbers, so a reader can know at a glance <em>what</em> they are, rather than just their value.</li>
<li>Run the code through <code>flake8</code> and <code>pycodestyle</code> to get hints about non-pythonic code such as the variable names.</li>
</ul>

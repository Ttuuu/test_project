<p>I also think you are using older styles.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>private bool _loaded;
public bool Loaded { get =&gt; _loaded; set =&gt; _loaded = value; }
</code></pre>

<p>Is awkward and really should have a better name:</p>

<pre><code>public bool IsLoaded {get; set;}
</code></pre>

<p>Looks like they would appreciate some OOP.  I would think there would be a class for airports.  Just Googling on 3 letter airport codes and Wikipedia, I whipped this up in 10 minutes:</p>

<pre><code>public class Airport
{
    private Airport() { }

    public string Id { get; private set; }
    public string Name { get; private set; }
    public string City { get; private set; }
    public TimeZoneInfo TimeZone { get; private set; }
    // add other pertinent properties such as Province or Country

    public override string ToString() =&gt; $"{Name} ({Id}), {City} {TimeZone.DisplayName}";

    // Helpful link on IATA 3 letter codes:
    // https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/IATA_Codes/IATA_Code_Y.htm

    public static Airport YUL =&gt; new Airport
    {
        Id = "YUL",
        Name = "Dorval",
        City = "Montreal",
        TimeZone = TimeZoneInfo.FindSystemTimeZoneById("Eastern Standard Time")
    };

    public static Airport YYZ =&gt; new Airport
    {
        Id = "YYZ",
        Name = "Toronto Pearson International Airport",
        City = "Toronto",
        TimeZone = TimeZoneInfo.FindSystemTimeZoneById("Eastern Standard Time")
    };

    // Calgary and Vancouver left as exercise
}
</code></pre>

<p>If they want OOP, give them OOP!  </p>

<p>Also, I would not make too many assumptions though they were assumed in the directions.  This may be the questioners lulling you into taking short-cuts and making your code too rigid.</p>

<ul>
<li>I would not assume all flights leave only from Montreal's Dorval
airport.   </li>
<li>I would not assume all flights leave exactly at noon. </li>
<li>I would not assume the departing and destination airports are in the 
same time zone or country.</li>
</ul>

<p>Heeding that advice, if I were to make a <code>Flight</code> class, I would have a <code>Departing</code> airport (not assume it's Montreal), a <code>Destination</code> airport, a <code>DepartingTime</code> (not assuming Noon Montreal), and <code>ArrivingTime</code>.  Internally, all <code>DateTime</code> objects would be UTC.  Displayed times would be local to the respective airport.  That is the departing time is local the the departing airport, but the arrival time would be local the the destination airport, which is why I included <code>TimeZone</code> as a property in the <code>Airport</code> class.</p>

<p>Maybe one acceptable assumption would be that an <code>Unspecified</code> date and time would also be considered local to the respective airport.  Or you may prompt for clarity of throw an exception.</p>

<p>First off, there is quite a bit of context missing for a good review, most importantly: What is the purpose of the class that this method belongs to? This method contains a mixture of frontend code and buiness code, suggesting that you generally haven't divided up your code properly.</p>

<p>Also why does this class have a field <code>depotNo</code>, which only serves as the argument in the expression <code>depots.get(depotNo)</code> multiple times? At the very least this method should call <code>Depot depot = depots.get(depotNo);</code> once. Better would be that <code>Depot depot</code> be either a field in the class (replacing <code>depotNo</code>) or be an argument passed to this method.</p>

<hr>

<p>Don't define all your variables at the start of the method. Allways define them as late as possible in the smallest needed scope.</p>

<hr>

<p>Keep the number of indention levels as low as possible. For example, at the start instead of putting the whole functionallity inside the <code>if (!depots.get(depotNo).getVehicles().isEmpty())</code> block, exit the method there and then and put the rest of the code on the same level:</p>

<pre><code>public void reAssignVehicles() {
  Depot depot = depots.get(depotNo);
  if (depot.getVehicles().isEmpty()) {
      System.out.println("There are no vehicles in the Depot to reassign");
      return;
  }

  do {
     // ...
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>You also loop over the list of vehicles to find the selected vehicle, however have and use a method that already does that, so you are looking up the vehicle twice. </p>

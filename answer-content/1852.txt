  <p>Should I create a separate class (and an interface for both classes), or should I try to expand this one?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In real LISP there is no separate representation for lists. List is just a chain of dotted pairs actually. So, I think, it's better to modify the original class and allow assigning list's cdr to anything other than NList.</p>

<p>By the way, why not just use properties for this:</p>

<pre><code>public object car ()
{
    return _car;
}

public NList cdr ()
{
    return _cdr;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also, if you already have class SExp, it may be a good idea to return SExp instead of object here.</p>

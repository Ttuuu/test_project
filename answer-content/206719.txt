<p>The code looks well presented, and it's clear how it maps to the problem statement.</p>

<p>The one thing that's not well defined is how we deal with exact equality of times.  I'm assuming that intervals are always half-open (i.e. including the start time, but excluding the end time); it would be wise to add suitable comments to ensure that all readers agree on what's expected.</p>

<hr>

<p>It's possible to simplify considerably, because in all cases we want (and none we don't), <code>t1</code> ends after <code>t2</code> begins and <code>t2</code> ends after <code>t1</code> begins, giving us a simpler expression:</p>

<pre><code>t1.begin.isBefore(t2.end) &amp;&amp; t2.begin.isBefore(t1.end)
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>If the <code>Interval</code> class is under your control, consider making this method a public instance method of that class.  You might also want to check that the parameters are not <code>null</code>, if users might use that to indicate an empty interval:</p>

<pre><code>if (t1 == null || t2 == null)
    return false;
</code></pre>

<p>(this latter is an argument against using an instance method, as then the <em>caller</em> would need to check <code>t1</code> isn't null).</p>

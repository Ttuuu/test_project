  <p>How can i prevent that ships may have the same coordinates?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, you want to pick three distinct locations on the board randomly; one for each ship. Sounds like you want a random sample (without replacement) of size three from the population of the game board coordinates:</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>from random import sample
from itertools import product

ROWS = 5
COLUMNS = 5
NUM_SHIPS = 3

# game_coordinates = [
#   (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4),
#   (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4),
#   (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4),
#   (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4),
#   (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
# ]
game_coordinates = list(product(range(ROWS), range(COLUMNS)))

ship1, ship2, ship3 = sample(game_coordinates, NUM_SHIPS)
</code></pre>

<p>Explanation of the above code:</p>

<p>First we generate a list of all the game coordinates using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.product" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>itertools.product</code></a> to calculate the Cartesian product of the row and column indices.</p>

<p>Then using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.sample" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>random.sample</code></a>, we take a random sample (without replacement) of size three from <code>game_coordinates</code> to get the coordinates of the three ships.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> To expand on the above example (and to address @TemporalWolf's comment), I should clarify that creating the list of game coordinates only needs to happen <strong>once</strong> per program run.</p>

<p>Near the top of the program, you can declare game constants like so:</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>ROWS = 5
COLUMNS = 5
NUM_SHIPS = 3
GAME_COORDINATES = list(product(range(ROWS), range(COLUMNS)))
</code></pre>

<p>Then in <code>play_game</code>:</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code># set of ships the player must hit to win the game
ships = set(sample(GAME_COORDINATES, NUM_SHIPS))

# ...

# player hit a ship!
elif (row, column) in ships:
    # ...
    game_board[row][column] = "X"
    ships.remove((row, column))

    # player hit all the ships -- victory!
    if not ships:
        # print congratulatory message
</code></pre>

<p>The list of coordinates <code>GAME_COORDINATES</code> is created only once at the beginning of the program, and used (and re-used) in each call to <code>play_game</code> within the same program run.</p>

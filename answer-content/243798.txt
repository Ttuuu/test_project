<p><strong>The code is not the cause of the slow down</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since I wrote it in C++, I thought that my program would be faster than the original. However, mine took 25.8 ms at the fastest, while the original took only 1.45 ms on the same machine.</p>

<p>I get about 1ms when compiling with <code>g++ -O3</code>. So the code is achieves your goal of performing (at least as) well as the <code>.pyx</code> code, it must be your compilation options. C++ compilers often do not turn on optimisations by default. When bench-marking code ensure that you are compiling your code with optimisations on.</p>
<p>As you mention there are optimisations that can be applied to the code, such as using <code>sqrt(n)</code>, which you won't use because you "need to compare with the original". Your code seems to be already as optimised as the <code>.pyx</code>, so any further optimisations may impair the comparison. You could avoid using <code>using namespace std;</code>, however, which is not usually recommended as using an entire name space can result in name collisions.</p>

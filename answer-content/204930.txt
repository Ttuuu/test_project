<h2>Don't abbreviate names unncessarily</h2>

<p>You are abbreviating a lot of names, but there mostly is no reason for that. Instead of <code>scr</code>, just write <code>screen</code>. The more you abbreviate, the less it is clear what you actually mean. Some abbreviations also might cause misinterpretations: for example with <code>cordx</code>, is that a coordinate, or does it refer to an actual <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cord%20Cord" rel="nofollow noreferrer">cord</a>?</p>

<p>On the other hand, sometimes you repeat things unnecessarily in names. For example, the function <code>RenderScr()</code> is a member of <code>class Screen</code>. So the <code>Scr</code> part in the function name is redundant, just call it <code>Render()</code>. Also, in the case of <code>cordx</code> and <code>cordy</code>, the names <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are generally understood to be coordinates, so you can cut the <code>cord</code> off.</p>

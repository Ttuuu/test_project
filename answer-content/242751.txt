<p>I would personally use the <code>JOIN</code>, because the query here is fairly simple. You are just matching two tables.<br>
A subselect is handy for more complex lookups though.</p>

<p>But each DBMS has its own way of parsing and optimizing queries.<br>
You should run the <strong>execution plan</strong> on each query and compare results.</p>

<p>Like with Mysql, use the <code>EXPLAIN</code> command to determine which one would perform better. To get representative results you should fill up the tables with sample data. Add a least a few thousand records.
Also add <strong>indexes</strong> where appropriate. It could be interesting to run the tests with and without indexes.</p>

<p>The presence (or lack) of indexes will affect the query optimizer. Sometimes you have to provide hints, if the query optimizer does not choose the 'best' index.</p>

<p>It should be noted that performance is related to good DB design. These table examples have no primary key, no index etc.</p>

<p>Interpreting any source code language entirely by regular expression — which is to say, without actually <em>parsing</em> the code and building an understanding of it on a syntactic level — is notoriously difficult to do. Your regular expressions do fall prey to some of the common issues with regexp-as-parser, since it will mis-highlight all of the following:</p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>public class Person {
    private Account my_import_export;
    private Multibyte stupidClassName;
    System.out.println("Hi \"friend\".");
}
</code></pre>
<p>Ensuring that your keywords don't start in the middle of a word would help a lot, and fix the first two. The escaped quotes thing is trickier.</p>

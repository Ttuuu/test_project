<h1>A small bit of ambiguity</h1>

<pre><code>params = {
    ...
}

...

while True:
    req = requests.get(base_url + "/questions", params=params)
</code></pre>

<p>Why not name your <code>params</code> variable something else? That last line is les readable than if you named the variable something like <code>site_info</code>, as one who isn't acquainted with the oddities of Python might distinguish the named argument from the variable easier. (As a programmer who frequents JavaScript, that line sure confused me. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯) Besides that, it's more readable, as your mind doesn't have to make the extra step to distinguish the variable fro the named parameter.</p>

<p>I'm filing this as a separate answer because it's on a very different topic from my previous one. You have a constant for note frequency, but (a) it isn't precise and (b) you should compute it rather than writing the constant.</p>

<p><span class="math-container">$$12 \log_2 \frac {130.81278} {55} \approx 15$$</span></p>

<p><span class="math-container">$$f = 55 \times 2^{15/12} = 110 \times 2^{1/4}$$</span></p>

<p><span class="math-container">$$f \approx 130.812,782,650,299...$$</span></p>

<p>In C,</p>

<pre><code>const double noteFrequency = 110*pow(2, 0.25);
</code></pre>

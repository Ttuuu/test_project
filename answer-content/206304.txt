<p>Some suggestions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Pass the code through at least one linter such as pycodestyle or flake8 to get more idiomatic Python.</li>
<li>Don't use <code>global</code>. Returning two values, while ugly, is preferable to having global state.</li>
<li>You can add <code>\n</code> to the end of a string to print a newline, avoiding empty <code>print()</code>s.</li>
<li>Use <code>argparse</code> to rather than <code>input()</code> to make the script â€¦ well, scriptable.</li>
<li>Each route should probably be an object rather than a disparate set of just stuff, even though these objects will have no methods for now.</li>
<li>Using a <code>main</code> method as the entry point for the functionality would make the script usable by other scripts.</li>
</ol>

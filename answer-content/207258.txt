  <p>I don't agree with the mass consciousness that goto is a code smell. </p>

<p><em>code smell</em> means a possible problem, not that is is a problem. So yes, it is a code smell. I too have used goto, only once in the last decade - and it was with C#. </p>

<p><strong>Why goto could be bad</strong></p>

<p>We do not trust ourselves to use it wisely and well. This is borne out in history.  There are millllions of COBOL LOC demonstrating that when used routinely <code>goto</code> tends to corrupt flow control, create inter and intra method coupling, and spawns "one off" code duplication; all to such a degree that one should assume the code will break when changed. In other words the code becomes unmaintainable. </p>

<p><strong>Why goto is bad</strong></p>

<p><code>goto</code> murders the bedrock of all good programs - structured programming and modular construction. <code>goto</code> <em>literally</em> goes around them. Anything you can say about modern languages, coding principles, object orientation, etc. is fundamentally rooted in these two precepts. full stop.</p>

<p>As for history: the unstructured nature of COBOL, for example, gave rise to an  "hard jump" coding style and mind set. It's fair to say the liberal use of <code>goto</code> is a code lobotomy. Many factors contribute to crumbling code but the more <code>goto</code>s the more schizophrenic the code becomes.  I have worked on a system that gave a dreadful feeling of random execution when stepping through with the debugger. Many existing bugs could not be duplicated and almost no bug could be reproduced reliably. 99 percent of code tweaks induced bugs. I am not exaggerating at all here! Our in house customer head guy told me "we don't bring up problems anymore because we know they won't be fixed." </p>

<p>So wide spread was the problem that Edsger Dijkstra wrote a seminal paper <a href="https://homepages.cwi.nl/~storm/teaching/reader/Dijkstra68.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><em>GOTO statement considered harmful</em></a> </p>

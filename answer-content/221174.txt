<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>I'd first point out that I don't think you need to split your menu in two.  There is no reason you can't put a blank spot in the menu where you want the logo. I did an example  using an empty list item for this: </p>

<p>HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;nav&gt;
      &lt;ul id="left-menu" class="menu"&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li class='blank-fill'&gt;&lt;/li&gt;     
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Store&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
  &lt;div class="site-branding"&gt;
    &lt;h1 class="site-title"&gt;&lt;a href="#" rel="home"&gt;Demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>CSS:</p>

<pre><code>nav{
  background: #5b6ee1;
}

nav ul{
  list-style: none;
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: row nowrap;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  margin: 0;
}

nav li{
  flex: 1 1 auto;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 1em;
}

nav a, .site-title a{
  color: white;
  padding: 1em 2em;
  text-decoration: none;
}

.blank-fill{
  flex: 2 1 auto; /* can update this based on how much space you want in the center */
}

.site-branding{
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: row nowrap;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;

  background: #847e87; /* to show where this div is located */
  /*
  Can put height 0 and change the .site-title to top: -0.8em.
  Note: may have to constantly tweak and update this as you change    sizes.
  */
  /* height: 0; */
}
.site-title{
  position: relative;
  top: -2em;
}

body{
  margin: 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then I used position:relative and a negative top value to move the site title up.</p>

<p>CSS Grid could take care of this as well and without creating empty elements.</p>

<p>Without seeing the rest of your page I can't really say if your SEO concerns are valid. I'd say I would agree that if you only have one h1 element (as it is okay to put an h1 in each section element) and only list the name of the company/group/page/etc once it would probably be better to have it outside the menu. Though there is nothing wrong with having it in the menu and I'd think there would be opportunities to have it elsewhere, too. If you do put an image in an h1 make sure you add the alt and title tags.</p>

<p>I'd say just put the logo/h1 in the nav menu. Breaking the menu into two and trying quirky fixes isn't semantic.  It may look normal but think about the bots reading your code and viewing these quirks as irregular practices.</p>

<p>As soon as you are finished using your <code>$stmt</code> object, it is practical to close it.</p>

<p>However, I find that I am never calling <code>$stmt-&gt;close();</code> in any of my projects because php is going to trash them as soon as my script is done anyhow.</p>

<p>Technically, you could have called it one line earlier.</p>

<p>I completely changed the approach which resulted in faster downloads, and improved functionality. The overall approach of the initial version works well for a generic solution looking for adding concurrency to independent jobs.</p>

<ol>
<li>Removed <code>zypper list-updates</code>. This format is easier for machine consumption, but it's not intended for Tumbleweed. Replaced with <code>zypper dup/inr/in --details</code>;</li>
<li>Removed background jobs and waits. Replaced with aria2 which handles the maximum number of concurrent connections;</li>
<li>It pays off learning more about awk capabilities, in order to replace sequences of grep/awk/tr with a single awk;</li>
<li>The main job of the script became building a plain text file with URIs and target directory for each .rpm file</li>
</ol>

<p>aria2 is really great tool. Superb quality. curl is not reliable in its native concurrent download capabilities.</p>

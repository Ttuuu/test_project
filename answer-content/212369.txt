<p>The go to unit testing framework in Java is <a href="https://junit.org/junit5/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">JUnit</a> and all major IDE tools have builtin support for writing test cases.</p>

<p>However, for very simple purposes and learning purpose, Java JDK has the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/language/assert.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>assert</code></a> keyword that can be used to test assumptions and also do unit tests.  in both cases (JUnit and <code>assert</code>) the rule is that failed tests throw exceptions that may have customized messages.</p>

<p>an example of usage of <code>assert</code>:</p>

<pre><code>assert getterTest.getTitle().equals("Assignment 1") : "wrong title default value"
</code></pre>

<p>note that assertions need to be explicitly enabled at runtime:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Enabling and Disabling Assertions By default, assertions are disabled
  at runtime. Two command-line switches allow you to selectively enable
  or disable assertions.</p>
  
  <p>To enable assertions at various granularities, use the
  -enableassertions, or -ea, switch. To disable assertions at various granularities, use the -disableassertions, or -da, switch.</p>

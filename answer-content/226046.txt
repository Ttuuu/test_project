<p>Well, <span class="math-container">\$(10^5)! \approx \left(\frac{10^5}{e}\right)^{10^5} \approx 10^{35657}\$</span> so it's a waste of time trying to optimise this. The only thing to do is go back to the drawing board and spend a few hours thinking about the mathematics. At best the code you've written will serve to analyse all trees up to a small number of vertices (maybe 7 or 8) to see what patterns you can spot which can help to guide you in the right direction.</p>

<p>I can be wrong, but it seems that the problem is that if you have a large number of keywords, you are defining a lot of regular expressions in vain. How about creating a single regex and replacing values only for found keywords?</p>

<pre><code>var words = string.Join("|", keywords.Keys);
text = Regex.Replace(text, $@"\b({words})\b", delegate (Match m)
{
    return keywords[m.Value];
});
</code></pre>
    </div>

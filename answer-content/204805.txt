<p>At a quick glance, I could nitpick about how I think K&amp;R (Java) style braces are cleaner for type definitions or that hex literals are better than binary literals, but that’s really my own personal preference. For an explanation on why hex is better than binary see <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/98159/41243">this answer on a question of mine</a>.</p>

<p>I feel like some partially applied functions may help clean up this section. </p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>let uint16ToByteArray n = [|(n &gt;&gt;&gt; 8) |&gt; byte; (n) |&gt; byte|]
let int16ToByteArray n = [|(n &gt;&gt;&gt; 8) |&gt; byte; (n) |&gt; byte|]
let uint32ToByteArray n = [|(n &gt;&gt;&gt; 24) |&gt; byte; (n &gt;&gt;&gt; 16) |&gt; byte; (n &gt;&gt;&gt; 8) |&gt; byte; (n) |&gt; byte|]

<p>I’m a little concerned about your User Type. 
You have 3 types. </p>

<pre><code>01
10
11
</code></pre>

<p>Is user type 3 a combination of types 1 and 2? I would expect to be able to do bitwise comparison of values with such a scheme. If you don’t intend this, I would modify 3 -&gt; 4 (<code>100</code>). I’m a little unclear on your intention, so ignore this if I’m wrong. </p>

<p>Ultimately though, I would consider pulling in a dependency on a serialization library like Protobuf. </p>

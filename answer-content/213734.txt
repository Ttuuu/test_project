<p>I see some things that may help you improve your program.  Here are a few things not mentioned by the other reviews.</p>

<h2>Fix the bug</h2>

<p>There is a problem with <code>getNumLength</code> because although it carefully counts digits, the value of <code>length</code> is never initialized.  If you want it to be zero, you need to set it to zero.</p>

<h2>Sanitize user input</h2>

<p>It's possible for the user to enter a non-numeric value or zero or a negative number.  Does your program correctly handle those cases?  Generally, a robust program checks thoroughly for such problems and handles them in a rational way.</p>

<h2>Consider alternative approaches</h2>

<p>Note that the <code>getNumLength</code> and <code>separate</code> functions both do successive divisions of the same number.  A more efficient approach would be to iterate through just once, calculating each digit, starting from the least significant digit and storing them in the appropriate structure for later printing. One approach using a fixed size string and pointers:</p>

<pre><code>void print_digits(int number) {
    char answer[14] = "0  0  0  0  0";
    char *ptr = &amp;answer[12];
    if (number) {
        while (number) {
            (*ptr) += number % 10;
            number /= 10;
            ptr -= 3;
        }
        ptr += 3;
    }
    puts(ptr);
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Omit <code>return 0</code></h2>

<p>When a C or C++ program reaches the end of <code>main</code> the compiler will automatically generate code to return 0, so it is not required to put <code>return 0;</code> explicitly at the end of <code>main</code>.  I prefer to omit it; others don't.  In any case, if you encounter that you'll know what it means.</p>

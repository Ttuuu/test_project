  <p>Could you do it without extra space and in <span class="math-container">\$O(n)\$</span> runtime?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The implementation uses <span class="math-container">\$O(n)\$</span> extra space.
A different approach is possible without extra space,
by rearranging the content of the input array,
so that the values that appear ordered, and at the position where they would be if nothing was missing.</p>

<p>Going with the example <code>[4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]</code>, the content can be rearranged in <span class="math-container">\$O(n)\$</span> time to become this:</p>

<pre><code>[1,2,3,4,3,2,7,8]
</code></pre>

<p>Then, with one more pass, you can identify <code>[5, 6]</code> as the missing pieces.</p>

<p>As mentioned, expanding the iterable into a list is probably not always desired.
Also a class seems to be overkill, since it needs to carry around an instance dict that's not being used.
An implementation as a generator function seems more lightweight and feasible.</p>

<pre><code>def enumerate(iterable, start=0):
    for item in iterable:
        yield (start, item)
        start += 1
</code></pre>
    </div>

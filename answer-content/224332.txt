<p><strong>Getting the computer choice</strong></p>

<p>Many things can be improved in the way the computer choice is computed:</p>

<pre><code>import random
computerChoice = ''
for x in range(1):
    num = random.randint(1,4)
if num == 1:
    computerChoice = 'rock'
elif num == 2:
    computerChoice = 'paper'
elif num == 4:
    computerChoice = 'scissors'
</code></pre>

<p>Here are different steps to make things better:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Useless range: I don't really understand the point of <code>for x in range(1)</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Uncaught bug: the case <code>num == 3</code> is not handled in any way. My guess is that both <code>num = random.randint(1,4)</code> and <code>elif num == 4:</code> should use a 3 rather than a 4. Also, when that probleme occurs, we end up with <code>computerChoice = ''</code> which stays undetected until the end of the program.</p></li>
<li><p>Data structure over code: as mentionned above, there is an issue in the code mapping an integer value to a string value. You could have used a data structure to perform that operation rather than a bunch of <code>if...elif...</code> and that issue would have been detected earlier.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This could be done with a list (and some re-indexing):</p>

<pre><code>cpuChoices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']
computerChoice = cpuChoices[random.randint(0, 2)]
</code></pre>

<p>or a dictionnary:</p>

<pre><code>cpuChoices = {1: 'rock', 2: 'paper', 3: 'scissors'}
computerChoice = cpuChoices[random.randint(1, 3)]
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>The right tool for the right job: the Python standard library contains many nice tools and sometimes there is a perfect fit for what you are trying to achieve. This is particularly true for tasks which are common enough. In your case, there is: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.choice" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>random.choice</code></a>.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>cpuChoices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']
computerChoice = random.choice(cpuChoices)
</code></pre>

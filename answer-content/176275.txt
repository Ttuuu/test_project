<p>Your code has several flaws:</p>

<p>You use a random number generator to seed itself. That's useless. Just get the random numbers out, and you're done.</p>

<p>Your code declares exceptions that can never be thrown. Since you are using standard algorithms, your code will never throw <code>UnknownAlgorithmException</code>. Therefore, wrap the code like this:</p>

<pre><code>public byte[] encrypt(String str) {
    try {
        ...
        return bytes;
    } catch (GeneralSecurityException e) {
        throw new IllegalStateException(e);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As for the <code>UnsupportedEncodingException</code>: use <code>new String(bytes, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)</code> instead of <code>new String(bytes, "UTF-8")</code>.</p>

<p>Whenever you convert between bytes and characters, you <em>must</em> specify the encoding. Your IDE should warn whenever you use the unsafe conversion methods. (If it doesn't, your IDE isn't as helpful as it could and should be.)</p>

<p>The <code>byteArrayToString</code> method is unused. Remove it.</p>

<p>Carefully look at all the comments you wrote. Most of them repeat what the code already says. Remove those. Then, check whether the comments say something wrong. Remove those as well. After that, there are only few comments left, which is good.</p>

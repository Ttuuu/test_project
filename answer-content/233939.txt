<p>I'm going to copy and paste snippets from your other reviews that you havne't implemented as well as my own review:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>shortened names like out or d don't really have any benefit over
  slightly longer, clearer ones</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You still use the exact name "out" in your code:</p>

<pre><code>String out = "";
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>stick with code style guides</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Java in particular has common naming standards. You should use lowerCamelCase for class &amp; method variables such as:</p>

<pre><code>String UserInput
</code></pre>

<p>You may even notice StackExchange has given it different highlighting. Normally UpperCamelCase is used for classes.</p>

<pre><code>while (count &lt; ...
</code></pre>

<p>I'd suggest using a for-each loop here instead since you never use the 'count' variable</p>

<pre><code>WhatToDo 
</code></pre>

<p>I really don't like this name. I missed it at the top and it really surprised me when I first saw it used. "WhatToDo" Is not a good name. </p>

<p>"test" is also a really bad name. There are lots of information available online &amp; on this site about variable namings. As a general rule, try to look at the name by itself and see if it's at all descriptive.</p>

<p>I don't see the point in declaring the variable "test". Just pass a boolean true/false directly to the method.</p>

<h1>Exceptions</h1>
<p>It is better to pass the property name to the exception constructor and let the exception class define the message. It is better because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's more DRY. If you have to throw that exception from another function you need to create the same message.</li>
<li>Single responsibility</li>
<li>Easier to test - only need to test the exception and the property name. The test will not break if you decide to change the message.</li>
<li>Logging  - when your exceptions connected to some logging mechanism and a tool. You can search for this specific exception and specific property name.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Naming</h1>
<p>I think a good name for a map is a name describing the key and the value. I think <code>values_</code> should be called <code>propertyName2Value</code>.</p>
<h1>Suggested Additions</h1>
<ul>
<li>Add a specific exception to the case  get is called with the wrong type</li>
<li>implement operator[]</li>
</ul>
<h1>Performance</h1>
<p>It is probably a micro-optimization but <code>map</code> operations runtime complexity are O(log N) where <code>unordered_map</code> operations are O(1).</p>

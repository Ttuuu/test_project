<p>Apart from the above mentioned points (which I mainly agree with), my OCD doesn't let me skip the first thing that I spotted:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#id17" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><strong>Use 4 spaces per indentation level.</strong></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the conditional part of an if-statement is long enough to require
  that it be written across multiple lines, it's worth noting that the
  combination of a two character keyword (i.e. if), plus a single space,
  plus an opening parenthesis creates a natural 4-space indent for the
  subsequent lines of the multiline conditional. This can produce a
  visual conflict with the indented suite of code nested inside the
  if-statement, which would also naturally be indented to 4 spaces. This
  PEP takes no explicit position on how (or whether) to further visually
  distinguish such conditional lines from the nested suite inside the
  if-statement.</p>

<p>More, <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#id21" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><strong>Surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines.</strong></a>. So, instead of:</p>

<pre><code>class B(A):
    # ...

class C(A):
    # ...
</code></pre>

<p>Use:</p>

<pre><code>class B(A):
    # ...


class C(A):
    # ...
</code></pre>

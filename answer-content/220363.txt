<p>The way to move things is extremely restricted. Instead of marking entities moveable (mobile?), encapsulate the behaviour of mobility behind an interface and inject a suitable implementation to each entity. When the time comes to move an entity, whoever is responsible for triggering it, fetch the mobility implementation from the entity and have it perform the motion on the entity in question.</p>

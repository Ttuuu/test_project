<p>This means if two events have the same time and belong to the same customer, then you are printing that there is a bug. But this is wrong. Suppose a customer arrives and he is immediately served. Then ARRIVAL event and SERVED event have the same time stamp and belong to the same customer.
I suggest that if two events have same time and same customer, then order them according to type of event. So, ARRIVAL event is first, followed by WAITS/LEAVES, followed by SERVED, followed by DONE</p>

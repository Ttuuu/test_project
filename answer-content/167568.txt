<p>You can always move the <code>require()</code> call for middlewares up. You're not doing anything with the returned value from calling it on <code>app</code>.</p>

<pre><code>var middlewares = require('./middlewares/config');

app.set(.....)

app.use(.....)

middlewares(app)
</code></pre>

<p>I'm assuming <code>prototypes</code> does some hacks with the global namespace. If so, then there's not much you can do about it. That's not really good practice though.</p>

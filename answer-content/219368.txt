<p>It ought to be clear that the algorithm inspects every element at least once.  Therefore its complexity cannot be less than O(<em>n</em>).</p>

<p>The variable and function names could be much more expressive.  Is the interface pre-determined by the challenge, or did you assume that inputs are integers?  It would be easier to use if it accepted a standard container, or an iterator pair in the usual way.</p>

<p>The test is flawed, because the input is not a rotation of a sorted array.  Also, a single test isn't enough - include more tests, ideally as the functionality is developed.</p>

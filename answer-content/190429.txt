<p>You can prevent duplicate pairs by incrementing/decrementing your counters not only once, but until they point to a number that is greater/lesser than the number they previously pointed to. That way, you can store the pairs in a <code>List</code> instead of a <code>Set</code>, which will probably be faster, because the <code>List</code> doesn't need to check whether it already contains a pair that is equal to the one being added.</p>

<p>Also, there is a typo in your method names <code>findAllParis</code>.</p>

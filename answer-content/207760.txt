<h2>Unused code</h2>
<p><code> for i, num in enumerate(nums):</code>, the <code>i</code> variable is used in your commented code, but commented code shouldn't exist, so <code>i</code> shouldn't exist either.</p>
<p>To come back on the commented code, I hope you didn't submit your solution with these comments as this is a (in my opinion) very bad practice. What does commented code mean after all? These comments could all be replaced by any debugging tool.</p>
<h2>Running time</h2>
<p><strike>I believe your solution is actually running on <span class="math-container">\$O(n*\log(n))\$</span>  time as the nested loop doesn't restart at index 1 every time it runs (which is a good thing).</strike> Seems like this is wrong.</p>
<h2>Code structure</h2>
<p>Usually, in an interview question code structure is pretty important. Right now you have one method that does everything. You should <em>at least</em> have a method that returns your result and one that prints it. Something like :</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    nums = ...
    k = ...
    print(contigSum(nums, k))

def contigSum(nums, k):
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>and <code>contigSum</code> should <strong>return</strong> the result, not print it.</p>

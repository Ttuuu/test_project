<p>Preallocate space in your <code>vector</code> for storage of your points, with <code>.reserve(size)</code>.  Without preallocation, <code>.push_back()</code> may need to reallocate and copy your data points several times, which takes time.</p>

<p>Instead of counting lines, a reasonable estimate could be based on the file size ... say, size of file divided by 32, for 3 nine-digit values per line, plus two spaces, two commas and a new line.  Over estimating is probably better than underestimating; resize down to actual size after youâ€™ve read all the data. </p>

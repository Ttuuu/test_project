<p>Although the motivation is to create independent unit tests, it only partially achieves that result.</p>

<p>Because the singleton is globally accessible from while it's alive, we've constrained the tests to run sequentially, which limits our ability to run more of them in a given time.</p>

<p>There may be benefit in making the singleton be thread-local for tests (this is an argument for using a suitable factory, as it can then be configured with a thread-local version for unit tests, and a global version for integration tests and production).</p>

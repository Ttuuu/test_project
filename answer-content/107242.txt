<p>It may be easier to read and maintain this by:</p>

<ol>
<li>Adding a space between each operator instead of cramming them against the operands</li>
<li>Having the class definitions in separate .cpp files</li>
</ol>

<p>Also, if you're going to have such a small Shapes.cpp file, you might as well just provide the value of <code>pi</code> within the class declaration.  I don't think the base class would need further implementation to warrant a separate .cpp file.</p>

<p>In addition to the removed duplicated code, the second version has other improvements too.</p>

<p>Instead of deeply nested <code>if ($isOk) { ... }</code> blocks, it has flattened the logic which is a lot more readable. And instead of <code>$isOK</code> which doesn't give a clue what it's about, he uses more meaningful names like <code>$questionValid</code> and <code>$answerValid</code>. </p>

<p>Note that this kind of repeated evaluation is well justified:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>if ( $questionValid ) {
    // ...
}
if ( $answerValid ) {
    // ...
}
if ( ! $questionValid || ( $formModel-&gt;hasAnswer() &amp;&amp; ! $answerValid ) ) {
    // ...
}
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>You <em>might try</em> to rewrite this with nested conditions to avoid the repeated evaluation of <code>$questionValid</code> and <code>! $questionValid</code>, but the performance gain would be insignificant, and you would sacrifice readability.</p>

<p>I would recommend to go one step further, and decompose <code>prepareAndSave</code> to multiple functions. It's doing too many things:</p>

<ul>
<li>prepare question</li>
<li>save question</li>
<li>prepare answer</li>
<li>save answer</li>
</ul>

<p>These are different responsibilities, it would be good to extract them into independent functions, each responsible for one thing and one thing alone.</p>

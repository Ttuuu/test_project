<p>@vnp already made a good comment about refactoring the check into its of function, I would like to add a bit about other aspects:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Naming:</p>

<p>Your variable n counts the number of tests. So you should name it accordingly.</p>

<pre><code>int numTests;
std::cin &gt;&gt; numTests;

for (int test = 0; test  &lt; numTests; ++test ) {
</code></pre>

<p>Note that i also changed the loop variable to test and also the post-increment to pre-increment. For basic types such as ints there is no real difference, however oce you start using iterators, post-increment always includes a copy which adds unnecessary overhead.</p></li>
<li><p>Maybe i am missing it but i dont see the variable N declared. </p></li>
<li><p>You are already using standard container, which is great, so you should also try to use iterators and more importantly range based loops. In this (arbitraryily simple) program they are not really applicable as you always need the running variable</p></li>
</ol>

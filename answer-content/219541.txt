<p>If this was computer graphics each operation would be called a transform. You would never do two or more transforms in sequence you would combine the transforms into a single transform and apply that to the image.</p>
<p>As in this case the transforms are abstracted and thus hard coded you can avoid the need to combine transforms and just hard code the combined transform. IE reverse and flip in one expression.</p>
<p>Invert is often called "image negative". The transform is done by subtracting the pixel value from the maximum possible pixel value</p>
<h2>Two versions</h2>
<p>The first inverts using <code>1 - pixel</code> and second using bitwise operation <code>pixel ^ 1</code></p>
<pre><code>const flipInvertImg = img =&gt; img.map(row =&gt; row.map((p,i) =&gt; 1 - row[row.length - 1 - i]))
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>const flipInvertImg = img =&gt; img.map(row =&gt; row.map((p,i) =&gt; row[row.length - 1 - i] ^ 1))
</code></pre>

<p>In most cases, the requirement of converting between c++ enumeration and string representation arises from interfacing to another program that does not understand your enumeration declarations. Often this other program will be a SQL database.</p>

<p><strong>Hence I would go for a code generator to ensure consistency over the whole system.</strong></p>

<p>The code generator could walk the whole database catalog and create an enumeration c-header and corresponding string arrays for everything in the database that could potentially carry enumeration semantics. Writing such a generator is less then a days work.</p>

<p>Note that this approach does not only free you from writing the string part. It also frees you from writing the enumeration definition altogether.</p>

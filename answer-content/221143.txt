<h3>Use extension methods</h3>
<p>I find you did well by implementing the <code>EverySecondElementIterator</code> as a separate class. However, I also think it would be better to turn it into an extension of <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> and use <code>MoveNext</code> instead of the internal <code>Node</code>.</p>
<p>Otherwise if someone suddenly comes up with the idea to skip every third element, you would need to modify the original <code>SimpleList</code> by creating another private class class and another property. We usually try to avoid modifying code that is tested and is working well. This would also violate the <a href="http://joelabrahamsson.com/a-simple-example-of-the-openclosed-principle/" rel="noreferrer">open/closed principle</a>.</p>
<p>It's much safer and extendable to create a new and independent extension that you also can resue with any <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> and skip every-second-element of any collection.</p>
<p>Let the <code>SimpleList</code> be closed for modifications by not implementing anything as specific as that enumerator. It is already opend for extension by implementing the <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> interface. Make use of it.</p>

<p>Rather than generating two random numbers it would be much faster to generate one and determine the other.</p>

<p><span class="math-container">$$
\begin{align}
    x + y &amp;= \text{sum}\\
    x * y &amp;= \text{product}
\end{align}
$$</span></p>

<p>Since <span class="math-container">\$\text{sum}\$</span> and <span class="math-container">\$\text{product}\$</span> are constants we can determine <span class="math-container">\$y\$</span> from either. And go on to find the equation that <span class="math-container">\$x\$</span> must hold.</p>

<p><span class="math-container">$$
\begin{align}
    x + y &amp;= \text{sum}\\
    y &amp;= \text{sum} - x\\
    x * y &amp;= \text{product}\\
    x * (\text{sum} - x) &amp;= \text{product}\\
    \text{sum}x - x^2 &amp;= \text{product}\\
\end{align}
$$</span></p>

<p>This means that we can find the solution by only using <span class="math-container">\$x\$</span>, and determining <span class="math-container">\$y\$</span> after the fact.</p>

<p>We can see how this effects your code by using <code>range</code> rather than <code>random.sample</code>. When generating both <span class="math-container">\$x\$</span> and <span class="math-container">\$y\$</span> you'll need two <code>for _ in range(n)</code> loops, which are nested. This means your code will run in <span class="math-container">\$O(n^2)\$</span> time. With only <span class="math-container">\$x\$</span> it will however run in <span class="math-container">\$O(n)\$</span> time as it will have only one for loop.</p>

<p>However we can get better than <span class="math-container">\$O(n)\$</span> time. As you should be able to see that the math is producing a quadratic, and so we can just use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_formula" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Quadratic Formula</a>.</p>

<p><span class="math-container">$$
\begin{align}
    \text{sum}x - x^2 &amp;= \text{product}\\
    0 &amp;= x^2 - \text{sum}x + \text{product}\\
    x &amp;= \frac{\text{sum} \pm \sqrt{\text{sum}^2 - 4\text{product}}}{2}\\
    y &amp;= \text{sum} - x
\end{align}

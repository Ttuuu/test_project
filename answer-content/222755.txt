<p>When working with static and shared libraries, one must be careful that you don't have several implementations of the <code>instance()</code> function. That would lead to hard to debug errors where there actually would exist more than one instance. To avoid this use an instance function inside a compilation unit (.cpp) and not in a template from a header file. </p>

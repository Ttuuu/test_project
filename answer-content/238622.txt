<p>So, about all those <code>global</code>s. They make your code <em>really</em> hard to read, I have almost no idea what is going on (after having read it twice). The general recommendation is to only use <code>global</code> objects if you really have to. Otherwise pass the objects either as arguments to the function, or write a class which has the relevant variables as attributes and keep the state like this.</p>

<p>Another thing that makes your code a lot easier to understand (both for other people and for yourself in two months time), are <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/" rel="noreferrer"><code>docstring</code>s</a>, which document what each function does, the parameters it takes and what it returns or modifies.</p>

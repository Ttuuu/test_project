<p>Since testing falls under the general heading of code review, I'm just going to review your testing strategy.</p>

<p>The question says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>your function should be able to work with any list value passed to it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but you are not testing this; you're only testing the single example that was given to you (and which, as it happens, you've hard-coded into your function).  Here's how you could test it:</p>

<pre><code>print(sentence(['eggs', 'bacon', 'spam', 'bacon']))
</code></pre>

<p>Does this print the string <code>eggs, bacon, spam, and bacon</code>?  If not, why?  (Try to understand the bug before you fix it -- don't just change things randomly until it works!)</p>

<p>An even better test would be:</p>

<pre><code>assert sentence(spam) == "apples, bananas, tofu, and cats"
assert sentence(['eggs', 'bacon', 'spam', 'bacon']) == "eggs, bacon, spam, and bacon"
</code></pre>

<p>Add this to your program, and then fix the <code>sentence</code> function so that neither line of code causes your program to fail.  This is called "test driven development" -- write the test first that says how you want the function to work, then write the function until the test passes!</p>

<p>The number of calls indeed grows slower than <span class="math-container">\$n*n!\$</span>. Its growth is only <span class="math-container">\$O(n!)\$</span>. However, number of calls is not the only source of complexity. </p>

<p>Constructing arguments for the recursive call also takes time, and <code>rem[:i] + rem[i + 1:]</code> is on average linear in terms of <code>n</code>. The total complexity therefore is <span class="math-container">\$O(n*n!)\$</span>, just as some people say.</p>

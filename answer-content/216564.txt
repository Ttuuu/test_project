<ul>
<li>I know you're trying to abbreviate "defense," but you could consider writing the whole thing out instead of making inconsistent naming with the preceding underscore. As such, you could write out "attack" as well to keep it more consistent.</li>
<li>Perhaps all those monster classes should be part of a common base class inheritance. There are a lot of repeated <code>self</code> statements and similar functions (especially <code>activate()</code>), making the code harder to follow and maintain.</li>
<li><p>The <code>60</code>, <code>15</code>, and <code>3</code> are "magic numbers" (numbers without some kind of given context), and from where they are, they could be harder to maintain.</p>

<p>Although Python doesn't have actual constants like other languages, you can still do something similar above the functions:</p>

<pre><code>MAX_DECK_CARDS = 60
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<pre><code>MAX_EXTRA_CARDS = 15
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<pre><code>MAX_EXTRA_CARDS = 3
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>There's a grammatical error here:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>"You have to many copies of that card in your deck (3)."
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>It should be "too" instead of "to."</p></li>
</ul>

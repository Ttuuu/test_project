<p>A few things to start with:</p>

<p>If your methods are only meant to be used internally then they should be private not public.</p>

<p>For your methods where the names don't really match what the methods are doing, some comments should be used.  You may remember what they are doing now but will you a year from now</p>

<p>The same goes for your variable names.  You don't gain anything by using one or two character names.</p>

<p>I don't see anywhere that you're storing the binary representation of the integer used in the constructor.  Even the <code>ToString</code> method only returns the integer not the binary representation of the integer.  To me this is not what one would expect from a class called <code>Binary</code>.</p>

<p><strong>* EDIT *</strong></p>

<p>After looking at your code further, it looks like you're using an integer with only the digits 0 and 1 to store the binary.  This is very anti-intuitive, especially since there aren't any comments to mention this, or any code to recognize malformed input.</p>

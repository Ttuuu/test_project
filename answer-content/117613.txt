<p>You've done a lot of work to comment and clarify your code, but I think it's actually <em>too</em> much commenting. Sometimes that reads as a wall of text instead of helpful brief comments. For instance:</p>

<pre><code>/*This is the size of the arrays in this program. It's better to use a          
constant, because makes easier to modify the arrays' size, if needed.*/
#define NUM 200
</code></pre>

<p>The first sentence is very verbose, while the rest is just a programming principle. If that's for your own reference as a beginner that's fine, but most programmers will know that. I'd suggest having no comment, and renaming your constant <code>ARRAY_SIZE</code>, as that you what you need to know anyway.</p>

<p>Comments are good, but most effective when short as they're more likely to be read that way. Usually people will know what the common functions of a program do, but comments can help illuminate what you're doing or why you need to do things a certain way. For your first <code>for</code> loop in <code>invert</code>, I'd keep it to a simple comment:</p>

<pre><code>// Loop backwards over s and store it in aux
</code></pre>

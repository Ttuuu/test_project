<p>Without some sample inputs I can only really comment on how the code reads, less on how it runs.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First, this should really be a few functions, I'll indicate below where might be good places to separate the code.</p></li>
<li><p>Why <code>import os</code> and <code>os.path</code>? Just <code>import os</code> then call <code>os.path.&lt;something&gt;</code></p></li>
<li><p>You don't need to wrap <code>i, captcha_image_file</code> in brackets when using <code>enumerate()</code>; <code>enumerate()</code> also takes an optional start argument; so, using f-strings as well, you can write:</p></li>
</ul>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>for count, captcha_image_file in enumerate(captcha_image_files, 1):
    print(f"[INFO] processing image {count}/{len(captcha_image_files)}")
</code></pre>

<p><code>count</code> typically indicates starting from 1, where <code>pos</code> or <code>index</code> would indicate starting from 0. Avoid using short, non-descriptive variables like <code>i</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li>The "Hack" can be shortened nicely with a ternary operator:</li>
</ul>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>contours = contours[0] if imutils.is_cv2() else contours[1]
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>I would separate the block immediately following this into a function, which would yield, rather than append to a list. This will be faster, cleaner, and get rid of dummy variables.</p></li>
<li><p>I would use itemgetter rather than a lambda function here, entirely a style choice, though.</p></li>
<li><p>Contrary to what I said earlier, I actually think using <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>w</code>, <code>h</code> is fine here as they are commonly understood to be the x and y directions, width and height.</p></li>
<li><p>Again, this last block (<code>for letter_bounding_box, letter_text ...</code>) should be its own function.</p></li>
<li><p>Really, I think this whole piece of code should be a class, the globals can then be class variables, and you can have three methods. You can then have a <code>main()</code> function which calls these methods and keeps track of which file you're on etc. This <code>main()</code> should sit inside: 
<code>if __name__ == '__main__':</code></p></li>
<li><p>Overall comments are good, somewhat excessive in parts but better than too sparse.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The bulk of the improvements would come from separating out your code into readable methods. Functions / methods should generally have one clear purpose. This also has the advantage of making generators easier to use as you can easily yield rather than constantly making lists.</p>

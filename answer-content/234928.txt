<p>You use yield properly, it's OK to yield from inside nested loops. But all the code behind your first foreach is kind of useless, it's not doing anything useful.</p>

<p>First the <code>yield break</code> is useless, cause there are no more yields following, there are no more return values produced no matter if IsLeaf true or false. Iteration ends anyway.</p>

<p>Second you fill up <code>results</code> with something, but the content of results is lost, then the Method exits. </p>

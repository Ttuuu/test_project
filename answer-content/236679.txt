<p>Your code represents a well-known pattern. In Java, files like this are called <em>resource files</em> and they are delivered together with the code in a .jar file (which is essentially a .zip file).</p>

<p>As pointed out in a comment, you cannot use your code with absolute paths. This is good since the entire purpose of the code is to find a resource <em>relative</em> to the source code that needs this resource.</p>

<p>The call to <code>abspath</code> looks redundant to me. I'm assuming that <code>__file__</code> is already an absolute path. You may want to check the documentation about it.</p>

<p>A downside of your function is that you have to define it in each file that wants to open relative files since it uses <code>__file__</code>. You cannot <code>import</code> that function, as it is now.</p>

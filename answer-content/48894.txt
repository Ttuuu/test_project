<p>It mostly looks pretty good. I have just a couple tweaks to suggest.</p>

<p>You have </p>

<pre><code>import wx.lib.pubsub

# this seems to be required -- bug?
pub = wx.lib.pubsub.Publisher()
</code></pre>

<p>The example from the wxpython wiki does</p>

<pre><code>from wx.lib.pubsub import Publisher as pub
</code></pre>

<p>I think using that form of the import will let you drop the line where you instantiate the Publisher.</p>

<p>I like to put my mainline code in a  main() routine right after the imports so it's clear where the work begins</p>

<pre><code>def main(args):
    #create the wx app
    app = wx.App(False)

    # pass the app to the controller
    controller = Controller(app)

    # start the app running
    app.MainLoop()
</code></pre>

<p>Then at the bottom of the file,</p>

<pre><code>if __name__ == '__main__':
    # call main rather than hiding the payload down here
    main(sys.argv)
</code></pre>
    </div>

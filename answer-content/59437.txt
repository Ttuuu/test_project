<p>I'll only address the so-called "magic numbers" that several reviewers have mentioned.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when you're working in pure mathematics, what seems at first glance to be a "magic number" really <strong>isn't</strong>.  It may be that the numbers themselves are just part of the problem statement.  I think the question boils down to this: can you come up with a name that is more descriptive than the number?  If there's a good name, you should probably use it.</p>

<p>At first glance, I thought that your numbers were an inherent part of the problem.  But when I looked at Abramowitz and Stegun, I saw that the referenced formula has already named your ugly-looking constants.  The names are <code>p</code> (which you mentioned in a comment), and <code>b1</code> through <code>b5</code>.  You should use those names in the code, because they create a very clear link to the original formula definition.</p>

<p>When you decided it was a good idea to add the comment<code>p=0.2316419</code>, it was very strong evidence that the number <strong>should</strong> be named.  (And once the <strong>code</strong> says <code>p=0.2316419</code>, the <strong>comment</strong> should be removed.)</p>

<p>By the way, it was VERY good of you to include the exact Abramowitz and Stegun reference in the comment.</p>

<p>Do not load your Cat with responsibilities of tracking all cats in the universe. That is way too much for a tiny little feline to handle and it breaks the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle" rel="nofollow noreferrer">single responsibility principle</a>. Instead implement a cat factory that keeps track of the cats it breeds. Set cat constructor visibility so that it can only be called from the factory method.</p>
<pre><code>public class Cat {
    Cat() {
        // Package private prevents construction by unauthorized sources.
    }
}

public class CatFactory {
    public static Cat create() {
        // Instantiate cat, keep record, return.
    }
}
</code></pre>
    </div>

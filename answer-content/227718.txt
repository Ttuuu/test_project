<p>While hooks are amazing, there is no point in using them when your function component becomes overly complex. Better to just create a class component.</p>

<p>Some reasons why switching to a class component is better:</p>

<ol>
<li>Defining functions within your functions will cause those variables to be redefined after each re-render which is a waste of efficiency and performance</li>
<li>Destructuring too many variables from your <code>useState</code> makes it exceedingly hard to maintain in the future and hard to read</li>
</ol>

<p>The general rule of thumb is that <code>class components</code> are "smart components" and <code>function components</code> are "dummy components". Reason why is that class components have a state and handle logic while "dummy components" are simply there to create views.</p>

<p>I would recommend creating a class component handling your validation, and simplifying your render method by creating "dummy components" with simple hook usage (so that they stay <em>dumb</em>).</p>

<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<ul>
<li><p>You can just remove the TODO until it's needed. The code will be easier to follow and if someone needs to localize later, they can figure it out themselves. It's clutter.</p></li>
<li><p><code>DataRevealActions</code> would probably be nice to pass in as properties, so the component is configurable. You could pass it in as now, or just have two different properties, <code>getCachedData</code> and <code>transformData</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Otherwise, looks great!</p>

<p>The issue has been resolved.</p>

<p>The problem was I was creating the pattern <code>r = pattern(keys)</code> for each keyword (remind you i had 600 keywords) for each cell of the excel which was completely unnecessary. </p>

<p>So if i had a <code>10(rows) * 10 (columns) excel file</code>, the same <code>600</code> pattern was getting created <code>600 * 10 * 10 times</code>.</p>

<p>So I created one dictionary of patterns just once and used the same <code>10 * 10</code> times.</p>

<pre><code>for cat,key in keyword_dic.items():
    temp = [pattern(keyword) for keyword in key]
    list_of_patterns[cat] = temp
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks everyone, for taking the time to go through the post!</p>

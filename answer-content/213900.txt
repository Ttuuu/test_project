<p>Instead of writing out those long strings of characters, it might be better to use the predefined constants.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>alphabet_number = string.ascii_lowercase +
                  string.ascii_digits +
                  string.ascii_uppercase
</code></pre>

<p>That way, you're saved from mistyping the list, and it's clearer to readers what's included.</p>
    </div>

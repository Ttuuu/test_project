<p>At the end of my first year programming I developed the exact same program with Python as well.</p>

<p>What I encourage you to do, and what I did, is to read the teams and their skill levels from a separate file. This way you can even prompt the user for which league they want to use.</p>

<p>i.e.</p>

<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>Which country's league do you wish to simulate?
$ England
</code></pre>

<p>And it will look for the file called England.csv and read its content for clubs and skill levels.</p>

<p>Also, read how many lines are in the file so that you can make the amount of clubs in the division dynamic and not simply 20 all the time.</p>

<p>Good luck and happy programming!</p>

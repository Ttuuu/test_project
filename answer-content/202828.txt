<p>I believe that the problem in the first place is not well defined (or we are trying to solve a different problem). And I mean...</p>

<p>The problem states the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>write a function findGrantsCap that finds in the most efficient manner a cap such that <strong>the least number of recipients</strong> is impacted and that the new budget constraint is met</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it focuses on the recipients impacted and not on the amounts.</p>

<p>e.g </p>

<pre><code>Input:  grantsArray = [2, 100, 50, 120, 1000], newBudget = 190
</code></pre>

<p>If I pick for cap the 100 value the array becomes like this</p>

<pre><code>Input:  grantsArray = [2, 100, 50, 1, 37], newBudget = 190
</code></pre>

<p>Now only 2 recipients affected (of course the sum of the array elements meets the newBudget constraint), but it's totally unfair. </p>

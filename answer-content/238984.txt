<p>Testing strategy seems like it might be a bit out of scope for Code Review, but having historically also found this process a bit confusing, my suggestion would be to not explicitly test your <code>VideoService</code> class. Test its consumers.</p>

<p>It's not necessary (or desirable) for there to be a one-to-one mapping of test classes to implementation classes. Your entry point to your tests should be your API - the point from which you can perform a useful operation (this can be your definition of a "unit") - in the case of a REST API this is probably your controller class. You might still end up with the situation where you end up with a mock repository which does the same as you have now, but you should be able to test all the other collaborators using their actual implementations rather than mocks. This way you will end up with less brittle tests, since you won't be mocking out all your collaborators and you won't have to update all those mocks if some behaviour changes.</p>

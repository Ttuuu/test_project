<p>I like that you prefer to use VBA's built in runtime errors, <strong><em>but</em></strong>...</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>Private Sub RaiseEmptyError(ByVal method As String)
    Err.Raise 9, TypeName(Me) &amp; "." &amp; method, method &amp; " cannot be called on Empty List!"
End Sub
Private Sub RaiseOutOfRangeError(Byval method As String)
    Err.Raise 9, TypeName(Me) &amp; "." &amp; method, method &amp; " Index is out of range!"
End Sub
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>You're raising two different errors with the same error number. As someone using this list, I would probably want to handle those two errors differently, but I would need two different error numbers to do so. I encourage you to define a custom error for the list being empty. The out of range error is fine as it is.</p>

<p>The code is neat and clean as far as I can tell. Variables and Methods/Properties have meaningful and clear names mostly. You overshorted some of them and I'm a little confused by what the <code>Nil</code> Function is, but I suspect someone familiar with Python wouldn't be. (Okay, I'm not really, but I had to read the code to understand that it returns an empty list). </p>

<p>This could be cleared up with some documentation I suspect. A few comments explaining what each procedure does would go a long way. Perhaps even some <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/52539/41243">Item.VB_Description attributes</a> so they show up in intellisense too? That's always nice to have when you're working with an unfamiliar class or library. Of course, don't get carried away. You don't need to tell us what <code>Contains</code> does, but it would be nice to understand what <code>Public Function Cons</code> is. (Again, I know it's a constructor, but you could never tell that from it's name alone.)</p>

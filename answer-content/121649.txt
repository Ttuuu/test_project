<p>It looks good overall. Nice short functions. Variable names are clear and easy to follow.</p>

<pre><code>  while (scanf("%ld\n", &amp;start) == 1) {
</code></pre>

<p>This will require you to hit enter <em>twice</em> to get the data in there. Better would be to add a space character at the front of the format string. This instructs scanf to eat any whitespace in front of the number.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you're strictly reading from a file, then this code is fine.</p>

<pre><code>  if (*iterations &gt;= 1000) {
    return(0);
  }
</code></pre>

<p>I think it would be more interesting to actually return <code>end</code> in this case as well. You will be able to see that it is not a palindrome (and the rules don't forbid this), and it would be interesting to see what happens when it hits that rule. It is important to have a bound so you don't hit the undefined behavior of arithmetic overflow.</p>

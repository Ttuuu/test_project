<p>You are wanting to shorten your code. Your code is meant to format the current date as <code>MM/DD/YY</code>. This can be accomplished by treating it the parts as strings appended to a "0" incase they are less than 10 so 7 becomes "07" and 27 becomes "027". Once this is done, you can use the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_slice_string.asp" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>String.slice()</code></a>. Looking at the case where the beginIndex is less than 0, <code>.slice(-n)</code> returns the last n characters from the string. For example <code>"07".slice(-2)</code> returns "07" and <code>"027".slice(-2)</code> returns "27". For the month, we have to add a numerical 1 because javascript months are 0 based (that is, January is 0 and February is 1).</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
var newDate = new Date(); // get today's date
// add one to the month then prepend a "0" (note the quotes to make it a string), then we will slice off the last 2 characters for the month
// repeat for the day and year, although no need to add one to either of these
// also note that prepending the "0" to the year is not necessary, it is personal preference to remain consistent and to insure that it is a string and not a number
var fullDate = ("0"+(newDate.getMonth()+1)).slice(-2) 
             + "/" + ("0" + newDate.getDate()).slice(-2)
             + "/" + ("0" + newDate.getFullYear()).slice(-2);

console.log(fullDate);
&lt;/script&gt;

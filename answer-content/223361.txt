<p>I know that you subsequently <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/q/164790/120114">posted c++ code for this</a> and that post has answers, one of which is accepted. </p>

<p>I did notice that the code above references the global variable <code>colours</code>. This may be seen as bad programming style because it can cause side effects that may be challenging to detect. Alternatively, function parameters could be used, or else a  class with a class/data/instance member.  </p>

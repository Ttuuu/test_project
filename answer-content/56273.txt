<p>Why not use a long to hold the result of the calculation?  Then the long can be checked against the (int) MAX and MIN values to see if overflow or underflow occurred?  If no violations have occurred, then the result can safely be re-cast back to an (int).</p>

<p>Or, is this too simple and I'm missing something very fundamental?  One thing that I HAVE omitted is the possibility that the long will also overflow.</p>

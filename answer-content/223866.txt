<p>There's actually not much I can do when it comes to efficiency, but it is clear that the code is not very readable. All these nested function calls make it very hard to track what's going on.</p>

<p>My suggestion would be to split this single method into multiple methods. This is a very normal strategy in programming. A method should only do one thing, and do it well. This is also called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Single responsibility principle</a>, and although this is usually applied to classes it can apply to methods as well. </p>

<p>Your code could look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public function getClassName()
{
    // return class name only, without namespace, which must be present
    return substr(__CLASS__, strrpos(__CLASS__, '\\') + 1);
}

public function getClassNameWords()
{
    // return an array of the words in the camel case class name
    return preg_split('/(?=[A-Z])/', lcfirst($this-&gt;getClassName()));
}

public function getModelName()
{
    // return the name for the model as defined by the class name
    return strtolower(implode('_', $this-&gt;getClassNameWords()));
}
</code></pre>

<p>Each of these three functions is clearly shorter and easier to read. The extra methods allow you to reuse the code they contain. The code is no longer locked up in a single method.</p>

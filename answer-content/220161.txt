<p>The <code>&lt;iostream&gt;</code> header is not used.</p>

<p><code>min_distance</code> can <em>theoretically</em> return an uninitialized value if all elements of <code>visited_set</code> are nonzero.  This shouldn't happen here, but initializing <code>min_index = 0</code> would remove a potential problem and compiler warning.</p>

<p><code>display</code> assumes that node 0 is the start node, but that value is passed in to <code>dijkstra</code>.  It should be passed in as a parameter.</p>

<p>In <code>dijkstra</code>, the <code>graph</code> parameter could be <code>const int graph[N][N]</code>, which would then allow the <code>graph</code> variable in <code>main</code> to also be const.  The <code>parent[0] = -1</code> assignment seems to be a typo.  It should be <code>parent[i] = -1;</code> to initialize all elements of <code>parent</code>.  The <code>for (int n = 0; n &lt; N; n++)</code> loop should have curly brackets around its body.  While not currently necessary, having them in can avoid future problems when the code is modified and makes it clearer what is in the loop body rather than looking like a line with bad indentation.</p>

<p>I haven't look too much at your algorithm, however there's a few things that stand out that you might want to look at.</p>

<p><strong>startRow</strong></p>

<p>You're passing start row into <code>place</code>.  The only time you use it is when you pass it into the recursive calls.  Are you supposed to be using it to limit the scope of the search, or is it simply unnecessary?</p>

<p><strong>noBreak</strong></p>

<p>There's a similar issue with <code>noBreak</code>.  You set it when constructing your class to <code>true</code> and nothing ever changes it.  If it's unnecessary, then it allows you to remove the level of nesting in your if block <code>if(noBreak</code>, since it's always true and so always going to be executed.</p>

<p><strong>isSafe</strong></p>

<p>The body of both your <code>if</code> clauses is the same, really you're doing <code>if(A|B|C|D)</code>, rather than <code>if(A|B) else if(C|D)</code>.  I'd combine the clauses to make it more obvious that this is the case.</p>

<p><strong>range checking</strong></p>

<p>The application doesn't seem to work when its size is 3 or less.  Consider adding some validation on the input.</p>

<p><strong>+= 1</strong></p>

<p>It's unusual to see <code>+= 1</code>, I'd expect <code>++</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Fields</strong></p>

<p>Class fields are usually marked as <code>private</code>, you've left them as the default of package private. Naming also usually follows the standard camelCase convention, you seem to have mixed an matched between it and alllowercase which is less easy to read.</p>

<p><strong>getBoardPic</strong></p>

<p>It's naming suggests that it returns a picture of the board (possibly in a string), however it actually prints the board to the console.  This is a bit misleading.</p>

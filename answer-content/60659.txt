<p>A few notes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I feel like some of your properties should have the <code>readonly</code> attribute applied to them.  Do we really want the API users to have the ability to change the <code>username</code>, <code>password</code>, or <code>server</code> variables after initialization?</p>

<pre><code>@property (nonatomic, strong, readonly) NSString *server;
</code></pre>

<p>If you do really want them to have that ability, I would add a method so that those variables could be set to different values at the same time.</p></li>
<li><p>You have the phrase "Required." in a lot of your <code>@param</code> comments.  As a frequent user of many APIs, I always assume that a valid parameter value is required unless told otherwise.  So you only need to tell me what parameters are optional in your documentation (which is just one, that I could see).</p></li>
<li><p>You forgot that little extra <code>*</code> on some of your comment lines.  This is important, since this is needed for Doxygen to parse these comment blocks (you are using <a href="http://www.doxygen.nl/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Doxygen</a>, correct?).</p>

<pre><code>/*  &lt;---- need two * right there
 *
 *  Required delegate method to handle successful execution of a SQL command on the server
 *
 *  @param  connection  The SQLConnection instance which handled the execution
 *  @param  results     The results, if any, returned from the database

</code></pre></li>

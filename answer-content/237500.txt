<p>You can get a vast improvement in speed: If x is divisible by y, then x is also divisible by (x / y) with the result y. </p>

<p>So if you try to get the divisors of 1,000,000,000,000 you only need to divide by the numbers 1 to 1,000,000 and add two divisors to your list at a time instead of 1. The exception is when x is a square and x/y = y since you donâ€™t want to add the same divisor twice. </p>

<p>On the get rid of <code>nick.clone()</code> question or any form of reference counting whatsoever. Problem is also ilustrated here <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32401857/how-can-i-keep-a-reference-to-a-key-after-it-has-been-inserted-into-a-hashmap">how-can-i-keep-a-reference-to-a-key-after-it-has-been-inserted-into-a-hashmap</a></p>

<p>I illustrate it with a simpler, sequential example:</p>

<pre><code>let mut users = HashMap&lt;String, ValueType&gt;;
let value = ValueType::new();
let reader = LineWriter::new(..);

let mut nick = String::new();
reader.read_line(&amp;mut nick);
let nick_ref = &amp;nick;

// attempt to move, it seems that should be valid
// if users is frozen (which is what happens in practice)
// because nick is borrowed
users.insert(nick, value);

// this remove isn't allowed (of course), but former move seems to be valid
// does the borrow checker need an inprovement?
users.remove(nick_ref);
</code></pre>

<p>Is the borrow checker too restrictive?</p>

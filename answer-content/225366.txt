<p>Yes, it's correct to use <code>const</code> here. That would be considered idiomatic Javascript. If you're using <code>const</code> when you shouldn't, you'll notice as it will produce a <code>TypeError</code>.</p>

<p>People coming from other languages might disagree as they think that <code>const</code> means that the variable is constant/immutable (which is not the case, it's just not re-assignable). But that is really a critique of the <em>naming of the keyword</em>, not <em>your usage of the keyword</em> (which is correct).</p>

<h2><strong>A small review</strong></h2>

<p>I noticed in both iterations of your code that you have to forward declare every single function. This is not advisable. It is better to declare <code>main()</code> last, thereby eliminating your need to forward declare. After all just imagine the forward declarations required for a project of significant size.</p>

<p>After that you might also want to start separating your logic into modular files that you can then <code>#include</code>. Small logically connected groups of functions, <code>#define</code>s, <code>struct</code>s and the like.</p>

<hr>

<p>also don't do this:</p>

<pre><code>// ncurses for, well, ncurses
#include &lt;ncurses.h&gt;
// time for the random seed
#include &lt;time.h&gt;
// string.h for strlen() 
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
// stdlib and stdio because why not
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
// ctype.h for toupper()
#include &lt;ctype.h&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to comment what each include is for (which I find unnecessary but I could be wrong) at least do it off to the side so scanning the <code>#include</code>s is readable. Like so:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;ncurses.h&gt; // for, well, ncurses
#include &lt;time.h&gt; // for random seed
#include &lt;string.h&gt; // for strlen()
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; // why not?
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; // why not?
#include &lt;ctype.h&gt; // for toupper()
</code></pre>

<p>And <strong>never, ever, <em>ever</em></strong> include headers you don't need. (I didn't read enough of the code but the comment "why not?" makes me think you didn't know if you were going to need <code>stdlib</code> or <code>stdio</code> and that's a bad reason to include something.) Just add the header when you need it.</p>

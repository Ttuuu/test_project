<p>You don't need to use <code>new</code> everywhere. Inside your main function, the <code>StudentDatabase</code> could very well reside on the stack so you don't need to delete it yourself.</p>

<p>One of the issues with how <code>StudentDatabase</code> is written now is ownership semantics. Once a student pointer is added to the database, the database asumes ownership upon it and deletes it in the destructor. What if the same student pointer were to be added to multiple databases, or used after the database is deleted?</p>

<p>Smart pointers help prevent such errors.</p>

<p>Two big ones:</p>

<ol>
<li>Don't use globals.  There are lots of good reasons why globals are generally bad practice, and you can either read about them, you can discover them for yourself through painful experience over the course of years, or you can trust all the people who have been there and will tell you the same thing, and just nip that habit in the bud when you're starting out.</li>
<li>Come up with an easier way to represent your cards.  Having separate <code>if</code> statements to check the values of the 6 of spades vs the 6 of diamonds (and so on for every value and every suit) is a <em>lot</em> of unnecessary work.</li>
</ol>

<p>Check out this answer I wrote a while back on representing a deck of cards in Python code; this is far from the only way to do it, but pay attention to how the suit is separated from the rank, and how simply defining all the possible suits and ranks lets us use the <code>product</code> function to generate a complete deck automatically.  The goal is to give yourself less work to do and to not need to copy+paste lots of code to do relatively simple things.</p>

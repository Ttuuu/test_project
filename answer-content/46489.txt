<p>The best way to do this would be to take each of your sections, and give them each a function of their own. Also, when it's possible, separate user input functions from purely logic to improve readability!</p>

<p>For example, it could start looking like this:</p>

<pre><code>def verify_pin(pin):
    if pin == '1234':
        return True
    else:
        return False

def log_in():
    tries = 0
    while tries &lt; 4:
        pin = input('Please Enter Your 4 Digit Pin: ')
        if verify_pin(pin):
            print("Pin accepted!")
            return True
        else:
            print("Invalid pin")
            tries += 1
    print("To many incorrect tries. Could not log in")
    return False

def start_menu():
    print("Welcome to the atm!")
    if log_in():
        # you will need to make this one yourself!
        main_menu()
    print("Exiting Program")

start_menu()
</code></pre>

<p>Whenever you can avoid nesting, you should. This makes it easier to read.</p>

<p>In this case you can clearly see logging in will open the main_menu (<em>which you will have to write</em>), and entering a correct pin is the only way to log in.</p>

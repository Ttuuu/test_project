<p>To begin with, you don't need <code>list_n</code> at all: a decision that the number is composite can be made on the fly, as soon as some remainder becomes 0. If none of them were 0, you know that the number is prime:</p>

<pre><code>    for n in range(2, x):
        if x % n == 0:
            return False
    return True
</code></pre>

<p>is effectively what your code is doing, but without the list, and without special case for <code>2</code>.</p>

<p>That said, of course the algorithm could be greatly improved, but it is beyond the point of this exercise.</p>

<p>Please be careful with the indentation because it looks like there are different number of spaces for different indentation depths and it looks very weird.</p>

<p>Minor improvements:</p>

<h3>Repetition</h3>

<pre><code> md5 = hashlib.md5()
 path = same_size[size][i]
 md5 = hashlib.md5()
</code></pre>

<p>I am almost sure there is no reason to repeat <code>md5 = hashlib.md5()</code> twice.</p>

<h3>"Native" iteration</h3>

<pre><code>while i &lt; len (same_size[size]):
 # Hash file content with read buffer
 md5 = hashlib.md5()
 path = same_size[size][i]
 ...
 i=i+1
</code></pre>

<p>You are iterating over all the files with the given size:</p>

<pre><code>for path in same_size[size]:
   ...
</code></pre>

<p>In general in Python you can use <code>for x in list_</code> to iterate over all items in any collection.</p>

<h3>Zero length automatically skipped</h3>

<pre><code>if len (same_size[size]) &gt; 1:
</code></pre>

<p>If you ask python to iterate over a zero length collection nothing happens, so you can remove this line as it does nothing but increases indentation and line count.</p>

<p>edit: No @miracle173 correctly noted that this is an efficiency gain to skip files of which there is only one of a certain size so it cannot be skipped.</p>

<h3>Default dict to simplify logic</h3>

<pre><code>    if file_size not in same_size:
     same_size[file_size] = list([path])
    else:
     same_size[file_size].append(path)
</code></pre>

<p>Not tested, but using a <code>defaultdict</code> you can avoid the branch and only use <code>append</code>.</p>

<h3>Same size?</h3>

<p>Are you sure you need to calculate also the size in order to check if two files are equal? Isn't the hash enough? </p>

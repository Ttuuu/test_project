<ul>
<li><p>Regarding <strong>time complexity</strong>. If you use an additional array, you can make only one passage through the array (not doing sorting) and have time complexity <code>O(N)</code>, where <code>N</code> - the number of elements in the array. Currently, it's <code>O(NlogN)</code> because of sorting.</p></li>
<li><p>Currently looks like if your method returns -1, it means that you have an even number of elements in the array (Invalid input?) So maybe you should throw some Exception such as <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> in this case? Moreover, what if you have elements with value -1 in your array?</p></li>
<li><p>You should simplify your <strong>loops</strong>. You have nested loop structure, however, you can have only one since you traverse the array only once. Currently, because of 2 loop structures, it takes some time to understand what's going on, where you increment your <code>i</code> variable, what is the stop condition, etc.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Minor comments</h2>

<ul>
<li>Do not start your variable names with a capital letter (<code>A</code>). This convention is reserved for classes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Edit</h2>

<p>Now it came to my mind that you can solve this task with one passage (in <code>O(N)</code>) without an additional array.</p>

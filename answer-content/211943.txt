<h3>Choice of Map Key</h3>

<p>Ultimately, as you are querying your map based upon the character, you should really make your key as the character.  This makes your regular subtraction of <code>'a'</code> unnecessary.</p>

<pre><code>    var storeOccurance = new Dictionary&lt;char, bool&gt;();
    for (char c = 'a'; c &lt;= 'z'; c++)
    {
        storeOccurance[c] = false;
    }
</code></pre>

<h3>Inconsistent behaviour for non-letter characters</h3>

<p>Given a string such as <code>anik00</code>, the first approach will produce a <code>false</code> response, as the duplicate 0s are detected like any other letter.  The other two approaches will produce <code>true</code>, as 0s are ignored.</p>

<h3>Comments</h3>

<p>I don't think these comments are necessary, as the code is clear enough on its own.  If you feel the need to add comments to explain what something is doing, you should extract methods instead to make these intentions clear.</p>

<h3>Which approach would I choose?</h3>

<p>The litmus test is how easy it is to understand.  I've not seen any serious LINQ for a number of years, and despite that I can understand your LINQ query without difficulty.  If you can create understandable code in fewer lines, it's a good thing.</p>

<p>Personally I tend to avoid creating classes, which do not implement any logic. Sometimes it makes sense or is even necessary, but always when I see such a class, I try to find out what operations are performed on its data and if they shouldn't be implemented as methods of that class.</p>

<p>What I don't like about your code is the <code>ProcessCart</code> method, which pretty much contains all the logic and as such needs to be modified virtually every time when any requirement changes. The <code>BilledShopppingItem</code> class could at least calculate the tax itself, getting the tax rate as a constructor parameter, but I would probably go further and pass it the whole <code>ITaxProcessor</code>. Ideally, the only responsibility of the <code>BillProcessor</code> class should to iterate through all the elements and perform only operations requiring knowledge of the whole shopping cart (e.g. the cheapest article is for free, 10% discount if total bill amount &gt; $100 etc.).</p>

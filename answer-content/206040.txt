<p>I agree with @mpasko256, try to be generic when you can, specific when you have to.</p>

<p>However, your code is misleading and need some improvements:</p>

<ul>
<li>As others said, your comments are misleading: you play with lengths here (or you should) not degrees.</li>
<li>If you give your program to your beloved grandmother, she'll not understand what to do. Give some (basic) information to your user (Purpose, what to type, ...)</li>
<li>If we remove your comments (misleading, as i said), we have to mentally do some gymnastics to understand '<em>first</em>', '<em>second</em>', '<em>third</em>' and '<em>fourth</em>'. Why just not naming them '<em>top</em>', '<em>right</em>', '<em>bottom</em>' and '<em>left</em>', that's more expressive.</li>
<li>try to splits functionalities into reusable functions</li>
</ul>

<p>Then, you can try to train your skills and enhancing your programe:</p>

<ul>
<li>asking the number of sides </li>
<li>asking  the degrees between sides</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>

<p>The equation given by Binet:</p>

<p>fib[n] = (phi^n - (-phi)^(-n)) / sqrt(5) where phi=(1+sqrt(5))/2</p>

<p>will give an accurate answer (unlike the answer above of fib [n] = phi^n / sqrt(5) + 1/2), which breaks down at values of n greater than 70).</p>

<p>Since you can calculate it directly, iteration and recursion are unnecessary.</p>

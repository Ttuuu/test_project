<p>Yet another approach, this time with string coercion. Knowing the type certainly helps simplify the tests, however it does come at a cost of speed. However thought I'd share for those who may be unfamiliar with the approach.</p>

<pre><code>Option Explicit

Public Function IsDistinct(LeftValue As Variant, RightValue As Variant) As Boolean
    IsDistinct = Not ((LeftValue &amp; vbNullString) = (RightValue &amp; vbNullString))
End Function

Public Sub Tests()
    Debug.Print IsDistinct(1, 1)
    Debug.Print IsDistinct(1, 0)
    Debug.Print IsDistinct(Null, 1)
    Debug.Print IsDistinct(0, Null)
    Debug.Print IsDistinct(Null, Null)

    Dim i As Long
    Dim t As Double
    Dim result As Boolean
    t = Timer
    'How long does it take?
    For i = 1 To 100000
        result = IsDistinct(1, 1)
        result = IsDistinct(1, 0)
        result = IsDistinct(Null, 1)
        result = IsDistinct(0, Null)
        result = IsDistinct(Null, Null)
    Next

    Debug.Print "This took " &amp; Timer - t &amp; " seconds"

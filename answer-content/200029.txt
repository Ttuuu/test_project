<p>Welcome to Code Review. That is pretty useful tool. :) From the GitHub link, I notice that you're using Python 3. There are a few things, I think you'd benefit from:</p>

<ol>
<li>Reorder your <code>import</code>s so that Python's library is imported first, followed by 3rd party modules; followed by your local <code>display</code> module. Read also the PEP-8 <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports" rel="nofollow noreferrer">guide for the same</a>.</li>
<li>Since you're combining requests and beautifulsoup4, I would suggest looking into Kenneth's yet another awesome project <a href="https://html.python-requests.org" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>requests-html</code></a>. You can have a single session to download the entire chapter/volume :)</li>
<li>Place your display initialisation code block inside the <code>if __name__ == "__main__"</code> clause.</li>
<li>You send a request more than once for the same page. First to get the page title, and later to actually start downloading images. Doing an HTTP request is heavy work. Do it once.</li>
<li><p>This looks ugly: <code>open(title + "/" + volume + "/" + str(counter) + ".png", 'wb')</code>. Use the <code>with</code> context block, and string formatting (python 3.6+):</p>

<pre><code>with open(f"{title}/{volume}/{counter}.png", 'wb') as imagefile:
    imagefile.write(image.content)
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

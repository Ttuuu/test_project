<p>This is a really bad pattern: neither your <code>Student</code> nor your <code>School</code> class should be responsible for retrieving themselves from the DB. Imagine retrieving a list of 100 <code>Student</code>s: that would mean 100+ queries to the DB. You can't even apply filters (e.g. get all the <code>Student</code>s who go to one <code>School</code>).</p>

<p>Your caching mechanism is solving the wrong problem. What you should do is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get all <code>School</code>s and store them in a <code>Dictionary&lt;int, School&gt;</code> where the key is the Id of the <code>School</code>.</li>
<li>Get all <code>Student</code>s, and then loop through them and attach the <code>School</code> based on the <code>SchoolId</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Two queries instead of hundreds or thousands.</p>

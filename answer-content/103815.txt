<p><strong>Disallow default methods if you don't want them. If you do want them, make that explicit</strong></p>

<p>Your code is silent as to whether you want default constructors to be available. For example, do you want programmers to be able to create empty <code>Entity</code> instances? Right now they can with code like the following because your compiler will generate a default constructor if you don't write one or disallow it:</p>

<pre><code>Entity emptyDude;
</code></pre>

<p>If you're alright with that fine, but even if you are, it inspires confidence if you write something like</p>

<p><code>Entity() = default</code></p>

<p>so folks know you have planned for this possibility. On the other hand, if you don't want empty <code>Entity</code> instances, you can explicitly disallow them:</p>

<pre><code>Entity() = delete
</code></pre>

<p>You should make a similar decision about default assignment and copy constructors. You can read more about this at <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/copy_constructor" rel="nofollow">cppreference.com</a>. </p>

<p>These comments apply to <code>SpecType</code> as well as to <code>Entity</code></p>

<p><strong>Consider whether a new class is really necessary</strong></p>

<p>You're probably going to build on these types, but if you weren't, I'd say that <code>Spec</code> type isn't really necessary. It just holds an integer and a simple member function. </p>

<p><strong>Use Structs for class members that have entirely public structure</strong></p>

<p>It seems that you don't take advantage of class features, so you  might consider using a struct instead. Since you have no private members of any kind, it's unclear what help the class structure is.</p>

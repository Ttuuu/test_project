<div class="s-prose s-prose__disable-spoiler-hover js-post-body" itemprop="text">
<p>Based on the code written by <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/203649/dariosicily">dariosicily</a> I made a bit of changes to it.</p>
<p><code>const key</code> could be declared outside with <code>let</code>, it improves a bit the performance. The inside of the loop, could be changed by:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>function anagrams(input) {
    const map = new Map();
    let key;
    for (let i = 0; i &lt; input.length; ++i) {
        if (map.has(key = [...input[i]].sort().join(''))) 
            map.get(key).push(input[i]);
        else map.set(key, [input[i]]);
    }
    return [...map.values()];
}
</code></pre>
<p>The assignment of variables has a quite notorious performance impact (when the input is great enough).</p>
<p>Note: I thought of writing it as a comment to dario but it was big.</p>

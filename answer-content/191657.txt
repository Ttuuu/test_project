<li>You want to look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#str.join" rel="nofollow noreferrer">str.join</a></li>
<li>by the last case, <code>len(listVar)</code> is run 4 times, which is very repetitive.  Better to set it to a temporary variable, and check that each time.</li>
<li>Python has some binary convenience  operators for common things like appending.  Instead of <code>listDisp = listDisp + foo</code> use <code>listDisp += foo</code></li>
<li>instead of calling <code>str()</code> on everything as you build the string, why not call it up front, so it can't be missed somewhere along the way.  Something at the top like <code>stringList = [ str(i) for i in listVar ]</code> will remove the need for all those <code>str()</code> calls sprinkled throughout the code.</li>
<li>Naming:  <code>listVar</code> is a variable.  It doesn't need to have 'var(iable)' in its name.  How about 'inputList'?  Names are important - they're messages to the future (you or whoever reads your code) about what you are/were trying to accomplish.  Similar issue with the name <code>commaCode</code>.</li>
<li><code>range(len(listVar[:-1]))</code> is the same as <code>range(len(listVar)-1)</code>, which is both easier to read, and can take advantage of point 2 and end up written as <code>range(listVarLen-1)</code> which is definitely clearer.</li>
</ol>

<p>Overall though, for a beginner, not bad!</p>
